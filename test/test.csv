Test_id;Summary;Text
1;Smooth;This is so far my favorite K-Cup.  Very rich, and yet very smooth.
2;Full Bodied, Rich Taste;I recently was in Winthrop on vacation and had the pleasure to meet the owner as he was roasting up some of his fine coffee.  This is the first coffee that I have ever drank the entire pot myself.
3;first time bonsai -- fantastic!;For your first bonsai plant..
4;very tasty :);This sesame oil is rich and aromatic, definitely top quality. I like to add it to noodles and Asian style vegetable salad with honey-roasted peanuts.
5;Are you kidding me?;I can not believe the lack of packaging from this company!! The coffee k-cups were thrown into a Ziploc baggie..
6;ok;Great product.  Dog likes them.
7;like many similiar foods, poor quality ingredients, but may need anyway;like many similiar foods, poor quality ingredients.  I only bought it as emergency food for when my cat refuses all wet food.
8;Laxatone review;I have a long hair Maine Coon Cat. He grooms himself a lot, and without the Laxatone he gets blocked up.
9;Yum!  but a little pricey for chips.;I really like the flavor and cruch of these chips. It just about makes the price worth it.
10;Good concept, poor design;"Edit: I've given this three stars vs my previous 1 star when I was told the can was not meant to brew tea in. I still would  prefer a ""total travel solution"", then it would have been 5 stars."
11;YUMMMMM;Best Jarred marinade I've ever had..
12;A great surprise from Taco Bell;When I saw the name Taco Bell on this product, I wasn't expecting much. I don't dislike their food, but I find their seasonings rather bland and ordinary.
13;good biscuit but gives you a sandy feeling in the mouth;well, i am not that impressed by this product like others.<br />I think overall it's okay but it leaves a sandy feeling in the mouth after you eat it.
14;I Love Hersheys Peanut Butter Cups;These 44 ounces of Reese's Easter Peanut Butter Cup Miniatures are perhaps the finest thing I could have bought with the eleven dollars and fifty-two cents that I spent on them.  They taste just like the classic, not-Easter themed Reese's Peanut Butter Cup Miniatures, but their festive blue-and-pink wrappers are so pretty.
15;greatest coffee! great price!;I think Teeccino is the best coffee around! And to find it in a 3-pk is even better. Great price.
16;Delicious and approcable blend from historic Napa Winery;A great blend in which Joe Hurliman manages to coax out the absolute best characteristics of each varietal and one that the sum is far greater than it parts.  Were it not for the high price tag, given its obvious edge in complexity and ageability, it would easily replace the Recanati Petit-Sirah/Zinfandel as my blend with which to introduce new wine drinkers to the wonderful world of wine.
17;tasty alternate to peanuts or almonds;These cashews are another nice addition to Emerald's line of nut snacks.  As someone who's addicted to peanuts and nuts for snacking (I usually have 2-3 containers open at any given time), I'm always looking for some variety, such as these with their salt+pepper seasoning reminiscent, in some ways, more of chips than nuts.
18;Addiction of the highest order!!!~;I buy out the store whenever I see them in stock.  Honestly, it's rare I find them, so I gotta do what I gotta do.
19;should be a staple in every medicine cabinet;I am very pleased to have found an all natural treatment for so many conditions. I have used this honey for a nasal staph infection I had that wouldn't go away with oral antibiotics.
20;Best Pancakes!!!;These pancakes are the best.<br />there 100% whole grain so they are healthier than enriched pancakes and you only need to add water.
21;mmehh;The description sounded great but the cookies didn't really live up to the promise.  It is not that the cookies were terrible, they weren't - but they weren't particularly good either - just 'mmehh'.
22;gimmie Gummies;I am a Haribo Gummi addict, and strawberry gummies (also the the twin cherries) are my favorites. It's hard to hold myself back! They satisfy my sweet tooth cravings.
23;Great Quick Treats;I love these treats for training! They are small but very tasty (or at least me dog seems to think so). Since they don't require her to chew, she does not get as distracted when being rewarded, so I am able to keep her focus better while teaching her.
24;These are great;This is my favorite flavor.  I love them and never get tired of them.
25;Excellent Way To Purchase Sweet 'N Low;"A small few of these may be ""leaking"" sugar, but you get that with the smaller boxes of grocery store boxes too.  This is my second order."
26;Tasty Chips;Once you pop one in your mouth..
27;Wow...strong coffee;If you like super strong coffee, then take home this French Roast. I was a bit shocked at how strong it was actually.
28;Made me eat cereal for breakfast;I don't eat raisin bran.  I got this box of Kellogg's Raisin Bran for my husband who has a bowl of regular raisin bran nearly every night.
29;Reminds me of Demi-Tasse;On an untypically cool August evening we decided to try Melitta Riviera Sunset Decaf. I heaped in too much coffee and what we got was a bitter, overly heavy cup .
30;Seems to be counterfeit;I bought a 6 pack box since it looks exactly like the one my wife was buying at Whole Foods. but just slightly less expensive.
31;Too hot;Too hot. I dare you too eat one.
32;Really good saffron;This is the fourth time I've ordered this product. I love the smell and taste of saffron-infused dishes and this brand is particularly good.
33;Disgusting!;I don't know how anyone can like ANY of the Walden Farms products.  Last year when I was doing Atkins for the first and last time, I found some Walden Farms products at my local grocer.
34;Drink it every day;I drink this every single day. It is healthy, natural and not overly sweet.
35;Love the taste and texture;The chocolate flavor is not too sweet, relies on natural sugars, has veggies and fruit added, and a smooth texture.  Tastes great cold or room temperature.
36;great;its natures valley, come on its been around for awhile and still a good product. can't go wrong here.
37;NU-SALT;I have been using this product for many years. I'm very happy with this product.
38;not too bad..;Can't expect organic kraft mac n cheese to taste exactly the same as what we grew up on but its not bad.<br />I give kraft 5 stars for offering an organic product but give 4 stars on flavor and 3 stars on trying to make it taste like the original.
39;Over priced but really good.;"I really like this Namaste Foods ""Say Cheez"" gluten free, vegan macaroni and cheese style dinner. It's not Kraft Mac & Cheese but I like it a lot better than Kraft! It's zesty and peppery and it does taste like cheese."
40;Simple and convenient;My son 2, loved this flavor! It is so easy to pack and feed, very few spills! Love that he can have a serving of fruit anywhere. I pnlu wish that they could sell two varieties in one pack.
41;EXCELLENT PRODUCT;EXCELLENT PRODUCT, SWEET TASTY AND THE KIDS LOVE THEM..
42;Cytomax;Excellent formulation for the lemon and lime product which mixes well with fruit juices. Far better than the other flavor they sell.
43;Too High On Carbs, Low On Protein;I am not rating this food with three stars because I dispute the quality of ingredients, or that it's one of the healthiest commercial dog food available on the market. Wellness is an excellent brand, more importantly, one whose quality control I trust.
44;"Too spicy ""flavor"", too fine grind";The good thing about the Chipotle flavor is generally that the smoked jalapenos are a bit milder and more flavorful than regular (raw) jalapenos.  That is NOT the case with this powder.
45;Guiltless indulgence;I love the calorie free Walden Farms products.  They add flavor without adding pounds.
46;Wood Shavings;I enjoy rooibos tea very much and drink it all the time.  Usually loose tea is fresher and better tasting.
47;pleased;I ordered these for my son because subscribe & save was A LOT cheaper than going and buying them at the store.  I have seen a lot of reviews where people received their jars broken, I ordered 5 different 12 pack jars of food and not a single one came broken, all of them were wrapped very well in bubble wrap.
48;wonderful Christmas cookies;I order three or four large tins of these scrumptious cookies every year around Christmas. They make very fine gifts, and I never fail to save one tin for myself.
49;love these cookies!!!;These are the best cookies! They are vegan and made with great ingredients.  I wish they sold these at the Whole Foods by my house.
50;YUM!;I'm about to place my third order of the Chocolate PB2.  YUM.
51;Fruity and delicious;The fruity taste is strong but not overpowering int his Lipton green tea. It is a pleasant change from regular tea.
52;Favorite tea;I could no longer find this tea at the grocery stores so bought it in bulk. I love this chai tea.
53;My cat's favorite food, very healthy also;Ingredients are all human grade - and the health information is really good. It's my Siberian cat's favorite food for sure - he snarfs it down.
54;Good deal green tea.;What a deal for us.  This tea on sale sells for $3.
55;Excellent soup mix.;"Excellent soup mix, even better when you ""doctor"" it up with your own vegetables and chicken. The best store bought soup mix there is."
56;good low carb choice;When looking for low carb items I found Swiss Miss Diet hot cocoa.  When I have a sweet tooth craving or the need to eat when I'm not hungry,I have found this to be a good alternative.
57;Crystal Light Ruby Red Grapefruit drink;Increasingly I've become aware that tastes that I like are not necessarily those of the masses that grocery stores cater to.  This is probably the best flavor that Crystal Light ever produced! I'm so glad that it is still available in some way and the delivery was very well done.
58;I love it;The little boxes at high prices in the stores always kept me away. It's a great substitute for rice, in 1/4 of the time.
59;Pamela Dark Chocolate cookies;My fiance was already hooked on Pamela's dark chocolate cookies..
60;Fudgy Alright!;I received my first taste of Nora's product as a cake mix from a food blog giveaway. I LOVED it.
61;Not for me;this does not taste like coconut water at all..
62;I Love this stuff;I am loving this brand, and using it for everything from cooking, to eating to skin, its so worth buying..
63;Reminds me of Pennsylvania;My husband is from PA. You cannot find these Snyder Sourdough Pretzels in Oklahoma.
64;These are the BEST gluten free pretzels;My wife and children are gluten intolerant and we searched for good pretzels for a long time. We finally found Glutino a few years ago and then began the quest of buying them at a reasonable price.
65;Love the flavor;We really enjoy this flavor.  They were at a great price.
66;Bitter to the last drop.;"Since I like dark, full bodied coffees, I thought ""Jet Fuel"" would be right up there.  While it is a dark roast, I think the roasters went a bit tooo far, as I find this blend bitter and acidic."
67;glaceau vitamin water;This product is not avail at my local store anymore and my son loves only this flavor. Received well packaged in a timely manner.
68;No Flavor!!!;I was expecting a lot more from this coffee. It was extremely bland and had very little coconut flavor.
69;High-quality GF pasta at a great price;I'm happy to recommend this product. My older daughter who has celiac disease was a pasta nut before her diagnosis, and Ancient Harvest's corn-quinoa pasta is just about the best boil-and-serve GF pasta we've found.
70;I love this s**t;Gatorade is just as good as water cause it won't give you bad kidneys if you drink too much of it and also you won't have to go to the bathroom so quick. Who ever says Gatorade is salty is on crack.
71;Surprisingly Good!;It's probably been over 30 years since I last bought instant coffee, but I'm in a temporary situation separated from my beloved Bodum French press, as well as drinking alone (sigh..
72;tastes great and is lower in calories!;a nutritional newsletter mentioned this and I thought it would be interesting to try.<br />have to say it tastes great to me - although I reconstitute it with twice as much water as the package recommends.
73;tea for Mum;My mother drinks a lot of tea.  She took the empty bag from a restaurant she had visited and told me to order the tea for her from the internet.
74;pill pockets are the best;Pill pockets are the best thing ever,  and buying them through Amazon is the best value for your money.  It is the only way my dog will take his vitamin every day.
75;Old!;I LOVE nu-organic bars
76;My boy likes it.;The 3rd stage has more texture than 2nd stage. In the beginning, my boy doesn't like 3rd stage that much as his variety 2nd stage Earth's best.
77;Great chips;These chips are a favorite as an alternative to potato chips. A bit pricier but tasty.
78;Dogs love them but ... seems to make them sugar high?;I have two young dogs, a dachshund (1yr) and  a chihuahua (6mths).  I use these to crate train them.
79;coconut oil...;I am very happy with this product.  It is a bit on the expensive side, but it is also a quality product.
80;Great coffee;I have been drinking Tully's Kona for the past 2 years, but with the price increase of kona, I needed to find something less expensive. After trying numerous kcups, this Mahogany is just as good as the Kona, with a full coffee flavor, and a hint of caramel.
81;zero outta 5;Zero out of five cats, all ferals, said euck.<br /><br />I've got a new feral who will eat nothing but Safeway's Mom-to-Mom Chicken Baby food (buck a jar!)<br /><br />He will not eat:<br />Chicken livers Steamed and pureed .
82;Great product;Just started using this so will update more later, I have an older cat 15 years old, everything she ate she would throw up she pretty much grew up on Iam's Weight Control cat food due to a previous urinary tract infection,and a weight problem (vet recommended) she weighed in at 17 lbs her heaviest the Iams never helped for years for weight control.Later in life she started losing the weight got down to a perfect weight then really started to lose to much then the last bag of Iams I bought her she refused to eat but a couple of kibbles a day, she was starving herself to death because even then she was throwing up,(she went down to 7lbs) I bought the Science Diet Sensitive stomach she is finally eating again, not throwing up so the food is A-OK with me and will spend the price for it, but like I said just starting using it will update on how she does more in to eating the food.
83;My favorite 2011 grocery Amazon purchase - best tasting GF oats on Amazon;I have purchased every gluten-free oat product available for sale on Amazon and this by far is the freshest and tastiest.  Easy to wiz in your blender or food processor for freshly ground oatflour - a nutritious and delicious flour that is fiber-rich.
84;Great Value, Ingredients and Taste;First, at 12oz per bottle, you've got plenty of wow per squeeze. It works out to be about $6 a bottle, which is really a great deal.
85;Great, healthy treats;These are very healthy, natural treats for your dog. About the size of a McDonald's hamburger, but they are really hard.
86;Great tasting instant coffee....;If you like instant coffee, Taster's Choice is the one to buy.  I especially like the single serve sticks because I know for sure what my coffee will taste like.
87;There's better ghee out there;Bought this on subscribe and save, so it was ~$14 for the jar, which I thought was a steal.  However, I was not that impressed by the quality of the ghee
88;Great product;Simple to set up.  Simple to maintain.
89;Keurig K-cups;I love the k-cup variety pack received. It's a very nice selection of coffees.
90;Excellent cat food;My cat loves the taste of this food and is very healthy after eating this for years. She has a very healthy coat because she also gets at least 1 can of wet food per day which provides protein and healthy fats.
91;Good chocolate taste and not too sweet;I'm always looking for a cookie that is not too sweet and these fill the bill for me.  Although I bought my first box at a local natural food store, I'll be buying these from Amazon from now on, given the much less expensive price.
92;smart product;I love peanut butter! I decided to purchase this product to try and cut a serving of regular pb in half. My favorite way to eat pb is a couple tbs.
93;Super Easy and great tasting;K-Cups are great if you only drink one cup a day otherwise it could get expensive.  This flavor is good for the basic coffee drinker, no funky flavors added, just basic coffee.
94;Looking for the best baklava by mail?;You have found it!  I have bought baklava products from literally hundreds of bakeries, including many online bakeries.  No other mail order has even come close to the excellent quality of Shatila.
95;Green Tea With Nice Flavor;Green teas, for the most part, have a different flavor some  tea drinkers may not  find appealing. As a long term tea drinker,  and given the benefits of green tea, I've been looking for a green tea I actually liked and this one makes the grade.
96;Seriously?????;Are they joking?  $11.99?  Just because they are vegan doesn't make them worth that much money.
97;Solved 2 years of 'poop problems' in 24 hours...;I adopted 2 kittens from an animal shelter 2 years ago. Both were treated for coccidia and roundworm at that time, and repeated stool tests over a 2-year period confirmed that these infections were indeed gone and nothing else funky was growing - but still, they had ongoing poop problems.
98;Good powdered milk, poor packaging;So far we've enjoyed this powdered milk in recipes, plain, and in  home made hot chocolate mix..
99;Egg Protein Review;I found this to be a good alternative to whey based protein powder. I have only used this product for 30 days and am reordering.
100;Very Mild;This is a very mild taco seasoning.  I added chili powder, garlic and onion to spice it up.
101;Love Them-as supplements...;"My kids love these vitamins-they ask for their ""Nordic Berries"" every day. Good for them, pretty good ingredients."
102;FABULOUS;Received it this week, made a package tonight with one large cut up chicken breast, perfect meal for me, I will keep this on hand always. I will subscribe to the item, may quicken the pace a bit more, I see eating it more than I originally thought I would.
103;Great Product;You will likely find this review to be quite strange.  But here goes .
104;Great for sensitive digestion!;I adopted a cat about 8 months ago from the Humane Society, and discovered pretty quickly that he did great on canned foods, but dry foods would always give him loose stools if not diarrhea.  I'm fine with feeding wet only for the most part
105;Okay but not great;I eat a lot of peanut butter, particular while pregnant because it happens to be one of my cravings.  This product is okay but not great.
106;Oatmeal, it's what's for breakfast!;"I love this oatmeal for both the taste and texture. True, it's not refined enough to just soak overnight without much cooking, like you can do with ""quick"" oats (which I also love)."
107;Very Nice Product;Just a few drops as a leave-in hairdress works very nicely.  There are no instructions on the bottle on how to use it, but I'm sure you can use it as a typical hot-oil treatment as well.
108;Why all the hype?;"I've come across this item a few times, but I hesitated to order it. When it was the Deal of the Day I decided ""why not?"" and ordered the 150ct container."
109;It does exactly what it says!!!;Wow, my husband and I have been praying for something like this..
110;Favorite Cereal;I can no longer buy Post Shredded Wheat 'Bran locally. I was pleasantly surprised when I found it through Amazon.
111;Candy;This is some of the best old time candy on the market. It is sticky,but worth every bite.
112;German Shepherd puppy likes these;These are great. They don't smell.
113;No hulls, but really small;"We recently got this, which seemed great because prior to this we purchased what we had thought to be ""paragon popcorn"" sold by amazon and we got this popcorn called ""snappy"" which really sucked because there were so many hulls, that we decided to buy this after reading the reviews.<br />upside: hardly any hulls<br />downside: the popcorn is very small, and not as tender as I would have thought it to be since the kernels are so small."
114;Great tasting;I add this to my cold brew lipton ice tea that I prepare.  Took a bit of experimenting to get the right amount of juice concentrate but once perfected, it's like drinking the perfect blend of sweetened ice tea.
115;A Staple Must Have;I even mix this with mashed potatoes (about half and half) and fry them. My son absolutely loves them.
116;Best Dog Treats;These liver chunks are like crack for dogs. The niblets are magic for training dogs because the critters will do anything for these.
117;No discernible smoke flavor;Don't know if I got a bad batch or old batch, but there is no smoke flavor at all.  At least the salt is relatively tasty, but considering that I could have saved money by just ordering normal Maldon Salt - that is what you should do.
118;YUMMY!;My daughter loves all the good combos from Ella's kitchen, I love them because they are organic and healthy!  They are great for travel and also save well.  I highly recommend anything from Ella's Kitchen when starting your baby on foods.
119;actually...;"I think this stuff is pretty good. I've had a few bags and have noticed that the ""toughness"" varies wildly from bag to bag."
120;My Pup Loves it!!;My pup loves it!! The minute I open my amazon package he smelled the bones! He instantly sat and waited patiently for me to open the pack of Smartbones.<br /><br />I am so glad I finally found a better alternative to rawhide.
121;Khrys;"I had heard wonderful things about these noodles, and with the low-cal ""included,"" thought I'd give them a shot.  They were AWFUL!  I rinsed them several times, but they still had a fishy smell."
122;Our Chinese Cresteds give these a paws up!;Our Chinese Cresteds do agility and though they are very food oriented, it's important to have a variety of special treats to keep them interested.  These surely fit the bill.
123;A Light and Delicious Tea with a Pleasant Aroma;I enjoy Bigelow's Green Teas (especially the Green Tea with Peach as noted in one of my other reviews).  I enjoy this tea as well.
124;So wonderful to find a G-Free Bread I can eat & like;Amazingly, this product is almost like San Francisco Sourdough Bread.  Of course nothing can beat the real thing but when you have celiac, you can't have the real thing, but this is the next best thing.
125;Great tasting product;This product has all the taste of regular popcorn but without the calories. Warning contents in bag may be very addictive.
126;Not a rip off!!!;To the person who states that the price is a rip off..
127;Mediocre noodles.;I wasn't impressed by the flavor
128;I love this company, & like this product - but loaded with sodium;I love the Just Cheese bars. It's basically just crisped cheese, some of which have powdered flavoring mixed in.
129;Really Great, Full Flavored Coffee, Ground Fine;Wow, this is really great coffee.  I generally like strong brews from Diedrich, Peets and Starbucks (and Timothy for the KCup) and was kind of reluctant to try this one as many brands end up being too weak or bitter for me.
130;Yummy little crackers;I'm not usually a big cracker person, but these were very flavorful and the ingredients were fairly natural and pronounceable, a rarity in prepared snacks. These are dandy for eating out of hand and the flavor holds up but doesn't overwhelm a nice strong cheese.
131;Very tasty and healthy!;All natural unprocessed raw ingredients. It doesn't get any healthier.
132;Delcious Tea!;I have bought this tea wherever I could find it and am very happy to find it available through Amazon.  It has been my favorite tea since we lived in Holland in the '70s.
133;Superb;This is my first experience with Yerba Mate tea.  I bought it for health reasons.
134;Great For Cakes;While I have not purchased this from Amazon I have used it for many years.  It makes a super layer for, my version, of Zuppa Engelesia and mixed with cream can be incorporated for Pate Choux.
135;Chi-Chi's;I have used chi-chi's seasoning for a long time. It became very hard to find in the stores and if I did find it ,I would buy all they had.
136;Excellent taste, quality and value;I was paying upwards of eight dollars a pound for American birch-based Xylitol. Not anymore, when buying this.
137;YUM!;I looooooooove Fiber One bars!  The Oats & Chocolate flavor is my favorite.  They taste soooo good!  We buy them in the big packs at BJ's because my husband & I each have at least 1 every day.
138;Tazo Wild Sweet Orange Tea;I had been buying this tea, one box at a time, in the super market, for a long time. When I saw that it was carried by Amazon, I decided that it was easier to buy the tea in a larger quantity, and have it delivered to me.
139;Good for instant.;I must confess before I review that I have never had an instant coffee that tasted as good as fresh ground brewed coffee.  However, I bought this for a camping trip due to weight constraints, and lack of equipment.
140;Nice taste, but too tough to chew for me.;Nice taste, but too tough to chew for me. It has a good smell of coconut skin & not too sweet.
141;Enjoyable coffee drink but not the best daily beverage for my family.;I tried this illy issimo Cappuccino coffee for a quick energy lift before lunch. The drink is made in Denmark (not Italy) and distributed by the Coca-Cola Co.
142;Ito-En Green Tea;The product arrived on time and it was as described on the page. Authentic Japanese Green Tea for very reasonable price.
143;Red Raspberry Leaf Tea;I've a difficult time drinking red raspberry leaf tea in the past. I wanted to try it again during my second pregnancy for uterine health.
144;Wonderfully disgusting (dont pay more than 5 bucks for the 2 pack);A few human flavors mixed with some amazingly gross and disgusting flavors.  Im not going to tell you about them, find out yourself.
145;The real deal;These.  are.
146;vipsusie;Butterfinger hot chocolate is very good. It taste like a butterfinger candy bar.
147;Love it!;We enjoy a cup of hot chocolate with our Keurig machine and used to have Cafe Escapes as our favorite.  When I saw the Grove Square brand at such a great price, I thought I'd give it a try.
148;Product fresh and same as I remember;It is rare that this cereal is available in stores anymore. This purchase is same a previously available in stores.
149;Feed my two dogs only Wellness brand. Consistently on top ten canned dog food lists;Had my big noble boy dog, who had been with me for ten years, die of Cancer recently. He was a animal shelter rescue (As all my pets have been, and are.
150;superb taste!;Once you master the technique of processing yogurt, using this starter will yield a smooth, firm and wonderfully tasteful product that will keep you from ever buying store yogurt again. I generally use the starter to make 2 liters and then use the resulting product as starter for 8 to 10 generations of yogurt.
151;Didn't taste like peanut butter to me.;The product didn't taste bad but to me it was more of a caramel / butterscotch flavor, not peanut butter.  I wanted to try this to replace real peanut butter in chocolate protein shakes.
152;AMAZING!!! 10 stars would not be enough...;Purchased this for the first time at a local Walmart. It is $4.
153;Must taste great;Our JRT tasted these for the first time today and LOVES them.<br />I'm pet-sitting for a neighbors largem, elderly dog.
154;Works fine;I like this combination shampoo and conditioner. It leaves my hair soft and clean, plus I like that the conditioner is included in the product since it saves a step.
155;Sliced Hard Chicken Hot Dogs for Cats!;"This product does not smell very well to me.  In fact, I have to use a fork to ""tenderized"" the pieces for my old kitty cat."
156;Good Stuff;I am very pleased with the Donut House K Kups brew.  It is good from the first cup to the last.
157;Valrhona;Few things in life, as of yet, have excited me as much as receiving this package in the mail. If ordering this item, expect the quality in the name, nothing less.
158;Great Size for Small Dogs!!! AND MINE LOVES IT!;The problem with treats for me was finding one I didn't have to keep breaking into little pieces when I was training.  Not only that, it seems my little Morkie really enjoys these.
159;Not sweet but still an excellent brew;This product would get 5-stars if the what was in the K-cup matched what was advertised as being in the K-cup.  This tea was not sweet whatsoever.
160;Love this little puff;My baby girl loves this little puff.  She's very attachy and she gets scared when I walk just a few feet away from her but if she has this on her hand she does not care if I am standing far from her.
161;First cup to last, Always good;I love Green Mountain Coffee from Amazon, and Hazelnut is my favorite. Not too strong or too artificial like other brands, but a nice smooth taste.
162;Green Tea;This is one of the best teas I have tasted. I use to purchase at a local store but found the price increase too steep.
163;Chinese Product Masquerading as American;I have bought these for a long time and felt better about the product because I believed them to be of American origin.  I purchased several bags (strips, wrapped apples, etc) and now realize the country of origin is CHINA.
164;Wow;The smell in the single serve package is a little off putting, but I suspect that that's because it is actually the smell of good, organic coffee. Even brewing, the smell is a bit sharp, but that first cup is.
165;Country Elligance Theme;"We used the candy pebbles for a wedding placing them in small galvanized buckets as favors.  Everyone thought this was a unique idea for a ""country elligance"" wedding theme."
166;YUMMY:);We ordered a case of these without never having tried them before and were pleasantly surprised..
167;My favorite Tea!!! No other Raspberry compares!!!!;My favorite tea is raspberry flavor and I have tried every one I have found in the stores. This one is by far my favorite! The flavors are so sweet and I have been able to give up coffee for this one! This is a great price too if you buy two 6-packs you save the shipping.
168;Unpleasant;
169;Yogi Tea;This is a very tasty tea, I love the flavor, it's very soothing. Not sure if I'm losing weight, but I drink it more Yogi tea than any other tea.
170;think thin brownie bars;I bought these bars for my grandson in college to munch on while studying for finals.he said they were so delicious.
171;Maybe I got a bad one;I love sweetened condensed milk. I use it in my coffee, pour it over fruit (kiwi and tart strawberries turn into something extraordinary with scm over them), and I especially love it on an iced dessert called halo-halo.
172;The Best;My husband is the coffee drinker in our family.  He has tried over a dozen flavors since I got the Keurig for him last year.
173;The best chocolate ever;This is the second year I ordered this assortment for Christmas gifts. My family now thinks I am wonderful.
174;Stale;I think these had been sitting around in a warehouse for a long time, because it took them a long time to send it to me and, when I got it, the tea tasted like cardboard. I've had red rasberry leaf tea before, so I know it's not supposed to taste like this.
175;Love this!;I love these crumbs. I use them for crusts for cheesecakes and for desserts and everyone comments on how great it tastes.
176;You've got to be kidding me.;This is a passable substitute for fish sauce, I'm told. I've used it from time to time.
177;Delicious!!!;This is as close as it gets to the Pao de Queijo made from scratch.<br />I am from Brazil, and Pao de Queijo is one of the food specialities of my state of Minas Gerais.
178;Outstanding, Bold, Lively Sumatran. best of the K-cups;First you must know I am one who roasts my own green beans at home, including Sumatran, but also many African varieties. I like a STRONG cup of coffee.
179;A wonderful, rich coffee;This is by far the best bean in town.  Before I left the states I was drinking Trader Joe's French Roast which I really enjoyed.
180;MYSTIC IS THE BEST CHAI BRAND!!;I am a chai-aholic. I don't drink coffee and discovered chai a long time ago at starbucks.
181;My new favorite coffee;I have been a Starbucks fan for many years until Dark Magic.  It is my new regular coffee.
182;Vegan Natural [Organic Corn] Kosher Choice;Vegan. Natural.
183;Yuck;This is really gross. Salty beyond belief.
184;My New Favorite Hot Sauce;How do I put this nicely? Hrm, ..
185;All in all, it's good;I am enjoying this popcorn snack. The caramel popcorn is appropriately crunchy, and there is the right amount of fudge drizzled on.
186;response to Tuaca;In response to the commenter who referenced Tuaca.<br /><br />I just tried the two together today and loved it.
187;Taste Great!  Pops Great!;Fantastic movie style poporn.  Easy to prepare and great tasting.
188;A fragrant coffee free of bitterness and burned flavor;Marley One Love Organic Coffee comes in pods, though I was also able to use them in a refillable Keurig-style pod for a K-cup coffeemaker. I am definitely not fond of bitter coffee or of coffee that tastes burned, so this coffee was a delightful surprise.
189;Prefer other flavors;"I took one and said good Russet potato chip but I found that the flavoring was subtle for my taste, a bit oily and overcooked. It may be because I am use to eating their great tasting <a href=""http://www."
190;Highly recommend Davidson's Teas;I've been buying Davidson's tea now for the past couple of years.  I brew a mixture of half Rooibos and half de-caf Earl Grey.
191;bad packaging;the product is good..
192;Fantastic;The color of Kirstian Reg&aacute
193;Taste like a chocolate covered wafer. With STEVIA!!!;I was looking for a bar to snack on that wasn't loaded with carbs and sugar. This was it.
194;Blue Cheese flavor is good for dipping;Dip bold flavored vegetables and fruits like apples, celery, broccoli and cauliflower in the Blue Cheese dressing. You won't get anything out of it on milder flavored or watery vegetables like iceberg lettuce and tomatoes.
195;Best candy bar I've ever had.;I remember this candy bar about 20 years ago when I was a kid.  For some reason they stopped making it.
196;Wise Tasty Deep;You are getting the best Kimchi you can get if you live in a rural area<br />as I do.<br /><br />It's expensive because it's made fresh, delivered to your door in 24 hours<br />you even (i did) get a call from a very nice gentleman confirming that you got<br />your kimchi !<br /><br />5 STAR SERVICE IS hard to come by anymore.
197;same old honey maid crackers, nice smaller size;I have always loved honey-maid crackers dipped in tea 'chai'. These ones of course have the same great taste, but come in smaller size and packs.
198;Peppermint Tea;I was looking forward to a nice cup of tea early this morning - you know, before it was a hundred degrees out! - so I brewed some of this. It's okay, but the flavor wasn't very strong.
199;Disappointing - very soft and too sweet;I am in constant pursuit of the best nougat and have tried several.  This one I purchased because it was cheaper but you get what you pay for.
200;The best dressing;I used to hate salad until I met this dressing. About 10 years ago, I tried this dressing for the first time, since then I have been enjoying eating salad.
201;Can't beat the 4- P's!;"I call it the ""4 P's of Vegetarianism"" (Protein Price Per Pound) and if you have to mail order most of your veg protein products like I do, the Linketts 6 lb can is about the best it gets short of making your own.  If you order this through Amazon's Subscribe and Save program, it's an even better deal."
202;oh the uses.;I bought this for the same reason the other reviewer mentioned, the superiority of the salt versus processed salt. Now I use this for food, but I also use it for body cleansing.
203;Saves me!;The Decaf 5-Hour Energy drink is a lifesaver.  At times after a busy and long day, and an evening event is coming up, just taking half or all of the decaf 5-hour energy drink perks me up and I enjoy the outing.
204;One of the worst;We drink several cups of coffee per day.  We decided to try this after getting a good price for it.
205;Wholly moley!;Great tasting afternoon snack, really satisfies my sweet tooth! Plus, it's simple whole food ingredients. Enjoying the navitas product line.
206;great product over priced shipping;The product was excellent but, the shipping was extremely over priced.<br />Would find a better way to order the product in the future.
207;so pleasantly surprised!!;I am a coffee fanatic who still just drips it through my Melitta cone.  After I read the reviews, I was still skeptical because this came out to a great per pound price and was supposedly similar to Petes.
208;Disappointed;"I was disappointed with ths product since the one in the picture is not what i recieved.  I got the one that is ""neutral taste, neutral flavor""."
209;Watch out for rocks;Wanted to try this brand of chia seeds and althought the packaging and seeds seemed fine enough I almost chipped a tooth from a seed that straggled its way in. That means they don't clean these seeds good.
210;my kitties didn't care for them;I liked that these treats didn't have anything gross in them (i.e.
211;Great value, great product;I am very pleased with Simply Organic Pure Vanilla Extract. The price was great and we have been thrilled with all of the delicious cookies and cakes we've made using this vanilla extract.
212;Decent, despite my caffeine sensitivity;I was very skeptical of this product, but I purchased one since the Neuro representatives were so friendly.  In the past couple of years, I have become very sensitive to caffeine.
213;Mixed reviews;I liked this cereal. It has good mouth feel and it's not too sweet.
214;a cupa tea for two;This is a hardy tea with an earthy after taste. Try with lemon to lighten this brew.
215;Probably the best tasting instant coffee around!;I have tried Member's Mark 100% Colombian instant coffees (both the regular and decaf version) and all I can say is WOW!!!  This is how instant coffee should be!  No bitter, astringent, chicory or corn-like after taste. In fact, no bad or nasty aftertaste at all that lingers in your mouth much like all the other instant coffees I've tasted and tried--- and I've tasted many, including the more popular brands like Nescafe Classic/Gold/Taster's Choice House Blend/Taster's Choice 100% Colombian, Yuban 100% Arabica Instant Coffee, Maxwell House, Folgers etc.
216;Happy cat;I have a pretty finicky feline. I was a little nervous about trying something new, but it was recommended to me.
217;Outstanding coffee with the smoothest of flavor;After having experienced the varied, horrible dark..
218;Ok;It is a small basket, well packaged, looks nice. There just isn't a whole lot in there, and what is in there are small amounts (ie big box half full).
219;Peanut Butter Pretzels - Tasty and Alliterative Too;Who'd've thought (notice the double contraction!) that peanut butter pretzels could taste so good?  Yes, one serving of 9 sandwiches contains 7g of fat (but no trans fats) and 140 calories, though few could possibly stop at just one serving.<br />Despite the dietary red flags, I've got to give these pretzel sandwiches five stars, just because they taste so good.
220;Quick and delicious;This is actually one of the better pearl couscous brands I have ever tried. Even on their own, they carry a pleasing flavor.
221;OK toy if you remove the rope for safety..;Purchased our Tug a Jug after my 12yr old beagle shredded an Atomic Treat Ball. I went with the TAJ because of the sturdy hard plastic and rubber neck and the ease of cleaning it out after each 'session'.
222;So good people are taking them from me!;These cookies seemed to be a pretty good deal when I saw that there was a special offer on them. I LOVE cookies (who doesnt??) but am kinda picky about texture.
223;Excellent edible bone!!;My barely 5 lb. 6 months old yorkie loves these bones!  I have been buying them for a few months now and she is so excited when ever she knows she is getting one.
224;good chocolate fix;I really enjoy this added to coffee for a mocha flavor.  Dissolves better than other fat free hot chocolate mixes.
225;IT BURNS!;"For MMORPG junkies, I heard the heat index for these best described as ""A DOT that stacks.""<br /><br />For the rest of you, that basically means that a few of these wonderful li'l things don't seem so bad."
226;The best!!!;Fresh, just enough herbs and spices. The grandchildren REQUIRE it on everything.
227;New stuff is arsenic free (but is that what you're buying?);I did alot of research last year and decided this was the best organic formula. My baby likes it and its caused no problems.
228;Weak coffee;I know flavored coffee is not intended to be blow your socks off dark roast, but all of the flavors in this variety pack are very weak, consider that if you like a full bodied cup, or taste.<br />The best of the bunch is probably the Egg Nog, which has a nice almost rum flavor, the Gingerbread is fairly bland, the French Toast is more like French Vanilla with a touch of cinnamon and the Holiday Blend is just plain and weak.
229;Yummy;Being pregnant I somehow decided that I absolutely needed a snow cone machine. Watermelon is my favorite flavor so I bought this gallon size to last the summer.
230;I wanted to like it...;I really liked the idea of this coffee but unfortunately it is just not good coffee.  The taste is bitter.
231;Delicious and Useful;"Not only is this Chili the most delicious canned chili I've ever had (speaking of the Campbell's Chunky brand in general), it's perfect for use in various quick and easy ""recipes"" since heating it up takes just moments versus the time involved in making homemade chili from scratch.  The Roadhouse isn't ""hot"" spicy, but it is very hearty and has a zing due to the great spices included."
232;Best, Authentic Flavor;I bought the 4 oz. package of this last time, and compared flavors, as I'd also found some at an International Market.
233;Healthy, and kittens dig it;"I recently took home two bengal kittens, and wanted to do everything ""right"", learning from past mistakes, and one of the mistakes I had made in the past was not researching cat nutrition enough.  So this time I did."
234;Not additive as most snack foods but but a good snack;Taste a bit like Styrofoam but then again did not think it was going to taste like the best potato chips I have every eaten and I have eaten some really good chips. If you are looking for snack food that tastes good without being self indulgent then this product will fill the bill.
235;Love It!!!;Love the french vanilla cappuccino kcup. It does not have the coffee taste.
236;Quantity not as described;What looks like a great deal is actually a terrible one. This is ONE box of 5 packs of granola bars (packed like Nature Valley).
237;Yum! Great Taste, great for energy!;Great tasting grahams!  Can't say much more. The texture is a bit different, as these are a whole grain snack, but the flavor couldn't be better!  After a long bie ride, I found myself out of my favorite energy bars.
238;Grounds in cup and failed to brew twice;Like others I havew had at least three instances of grounds in my cup.  Also two instances where the Keurig just couldn't push the brew through the cup.
239;Best treats for dogs or cats;I came across these by accident, and nearly didn't buy them at first.  They are expensive and they're really hard to find.
240;BEST BUY in BBQ Chips;Tried many varieties of BBQ chips and hands down these are the BEST on the market! These R not too salty or greasy. Great crispy crunch.
241;Amazing Coffee!;My husband and I were served this coffee at Derby Dinner Playhouse.  We asked the wait staff what brand they were serving and they said it was Douwe Egbert.
242;Plant Saver;I have an umbrella tree at the office where I work. Though matter how much or little I watered it, the leaves would turn yellow and fall off.
243;Great-tasting, healthy snack;I enjoy having this great-tasting, healthy snack available to munch on in between meals.  The no-salt variety is hard for me to find in the local stores.
244;Loved the Bone Suckin' Sauce, so I had to try the Bone Suckin' Mustard;"I had no ability to test this before shipping it but the kiddos loved the <a href=""http://www.amazon."
245;worth the try;This is definitely an oatmeal cereal. I did not like the little squares at first.
246;Fantastic Green Tea, the Best of Tazo;"*****<br />Tazo's China Green Tips Green Tea is a slightly stronger green tea than Tazo's Zen, and I liked that it doesn't contain Tazo's omnipresent ""natural flavors"" that almost all of their other teas contain, which to me is not an advantage. I like a natural, real taste with real ingredients sans vague ""natural flavors"" and sans flavorings, sans essences, etc."
247;Love this!!;"When I first tasted fondant, I hated it and labeled it ""Disgusting"", and said I would never try it again.  I went out on a limb and tried this fondant, because I wanted to make a special cake for my daughters 15th birthday."
248;Horrible;I have tried a number of gyokuros and this one is way to overpriced for what you get. H&S has good gyokuro as do others here in Japan that sell directly from their farms.
249;stale & lacking in flavor;I assumed that bulk purchases of this type would be fresh, drop shipped as a rule, but I have serious doubts now.  I have had the fresh gum, this isn't even close.
250;jeff's review;It is nice to have something to take the edge off this product will do that.  thanks.
251;Addictive!;I am back to order another container of this stuff after previously getting one for myself and one for my boyfriend (let him get his next jar himself, now that he's hooked on it.) I've tried other coconut oils and this one is by far the best.
252;Love these crunchy chips;I love these apple chips as agreat healthy alternative to potato chips. I like this peach flavor.
253;not what i expected;Expires in Dec 2011 and I did not get half of what the picture shows.  I got mostly Timothy's (which are not my favorite) and the ones I was excited to try were missing.
254;Outstanding!;I first tried these cookies while visiting family in Panama.  They were available at the local grocery stores.
255;Very tasty;My name is Patrick, and I am an American shorthair of indeterminate age and semi-discriminating tastes.  My human asked me to write this review for the Instinct Raw Boost Bites: Chicken Formula she got through the Vine program because she is unable to sample them herself.
256;Best Breakfast Tea;I drink this every morning with a tablespoon of sugar. Great tea with just the right amount of caffeine to survive the long, early mornings.
257;where's the cherry?;"This just doesn't taste like cherry to me.  I like sparkling juice, such as the <a href=""http://www."
258;Very Tasty and Good For You;The Oat Raisin Walnut Spice Whenever Bars were really good for not being something totally yummy like a Cadbury's Chocolate Bar. The taste is a mix of a sweetened bowl of oatmeal and an oatmeal cookie.
259;Worked very well;My aged cat has a very sensitive stomach and she cannot eat most cat foods available. However, she has absoloutely no problems with this.
260;Decent cup;Decent flavor, slightly bitter aftertaste. Not as strong as Starbucks Espresso Roast, not as smooth as Trader Joe's Organic Five Country Espresso Blend.
261;Great Set!! Perfect addition to any Pez collection;The Winnie the Pooh slueth collection is wonderful and contains hard to find characters.  So for any pez collector this is a great buy.
262;A fine cup of smoky tea;This Lapsang Souchong from Culinary Teas has a rich, complex flavor that surpasses quite a few other brands at a price that is comparable to or better than most.  A pound of loose tea can take a while to get through, though, so this may not be the best choice for someone looking to try smoked tea for the first time.
263;"Easy ""Fresh"" Grated Ginger";This is a great product if you like to use grated ginger but are often in a hurry.  It keeps a long time in the fridge, so keeping a supply of unopened tubes on hand is not a problem.
264;Outstanding!!;These are the BEST!!! Linzer Cookies I've ever had!..
265;Great Taste;If you like a strong taste in your coffee Dark Magic is for you.  i ordered 1 box and will be ordering it again.
266;Dense granola bar Cherry/Cranberry Flavor doesn't stand out;This is a densely packed, high calorie granola bar. I prefer a moister, crumbly bar where the fruit is more visible & contributes more to the flavor.
267;Tasty Chips;Once you pop one in your mouth..
268;Great Product !!;I was looking for an alternative for chocolate, as I follow a religion where chocolate is a prohibited due to having caffeine. A friend suggested Bob Mill's Carob Powder.
269;1 Of The Best.;I think this is one of the best protein shakes on the market. All natural with 15 grams of protein and 3 grams of fiber, Mix 1 is light tasting and almost 'refreshing'.
270;Something different;I LOVE the Keurig brewing system and I have tried many different kinds of k-cups. This is up there with the good ones, in my opinion.
271;Misses the mark!;After reading previous reviews, I was excited to enjoy this product.  I'm a big fan of Tazo chai made at Starbucks or at home using Tazo concentrate.
272;Tasty and wholesome;I'm not sure you can go wrong with Stacys Pita Chips other than being stale. But these were fine.
273;Tastes Great, Priced Right!;Smooth and well-balanced. Though not cheaper than my local grocery.
274;The Essential Sazerac Ingredient;Want a perfect Sazerac -- the official cocktail of New Orleans?  Can't get one without Peychauds bitters.  Four dashes add an incredible aromatic and tasty element to each Sazerac.
275;Doesn't taste like Sumatra;I'm used to drinking Starbuck's Sumatra Decaf and this product tastes ok, but it doesn't taste anything like what I am used to.  I had no idea there would be that much difference in the brands of Sumatra.
276;Tasty, healthy alternative protein powder;I started using this hemp protein when I was pregnant as an alternative to soy and whey. As I am not a vegan, do not need to add the protein as a supplement, but want a quick, easy way to add protein for breakfast.
277;Sauce not tastey at all!!;The sauce has a vinegar flavor not like regular teriyaki.  As a matter of fact the thai noodles don't taste like thai sauce either.
278;Tummy Tea;This will stop a bad tummy upset..
279;pot pie;Not any kind of pot pie i know of. got it and its dog treats.
280;Pop chips Chili Lime flavor;"I really didn't care much for this flavor or should I say ""lack of"" flavor.  I bought a case of bar-be-que also and they have much more taste."
281;Nice Tea;I read that hibiscus tea helped lower blood pressure, that was the original reason for the purchase. It may I don't know but it tastes very good better than some other brand I tried afterward.
282;Disappointed;For around $9, I recieved a small box of 8 crickets. I figured it would be like a delicacy, but upon popping one into my mouth- an overpowering vinegar taste along with an undesireably crunchy/non-dissolving texture(like eating a popcorn seed with vinegar powder) forced me to promptly spit it out.
283;S&B Golden Curry Sauce Mix, Extra Hot, 8.4-Ounce;If you like curry - this is the product for you.  Easy to use and tastes great - recommend for anyone.
284;Worse than the lunch room coffee at work.;Something is not right. Tastes very old.
285;Acquired Taste;I love salty snacks, and I wanted a low carb healthier alternative.  This is definitely and acquired taste.
286;Best of The Best;This is the best tasting honey at the best price.We love it and it is a lot less than the local honey and store bought brands.
287;Takes too long to Arrive;The item is as described by the opinions of the other reviewers. A more major issue is that Amazon ships it via the US Postal Service which can take (an already shelved product) 3 -7 days to arrive.
288;Cofee with a kick;Excellent flavor with that extra kick I like. Great brand.
289;Good Sushi Rice Ingredient;We got this to make homemade Sushi rice.  It does it's job flavoring the rice and you get quite a bit to a package.
290;Best chai ever;You have to try this instant chai. It is delicious! If you are someone who is working away from home, like I do, you'll enjoy the luxury of chai on the go.
291;Great taste, great snack, but a little expensive;This tastes great, and I would give this 5 stars, except it is a little too expensive.  At over $1.
292;Quality control problem or Poor Storage?;I had bought this product before from other vendors (three bags on amazon.com from Pet Zone USA in June and one bag in a local pet store in May), and I knew that my mother's dog adores this treat.
293;Disappointing;I expected better. Flavor is o.
294;Oh so virital flavorings;We love flavored coffees but the price is just to high so I bought orange flavor, hazelnut flavor, cherry flavor, caramel flavor, and chocolate flavor powers, to make my own and they work very well. we can flavor by the cup or the pot and we are very happy with them.
295;Proflowers No Friend to Women;ProFlowers advertises on Rush Limbaugh's radio show.<br />Rush Limbaugh who has been married 4 times, has no children or family,<br />called a Georgetown law student (who was invited to a US House committee meeting)<br />a slut and a prostitute for using<br />birth control.
296;Great flavor;This is a great hot sauce because it perfectly combines hotness and flavor. This sauce is spicy but not to much, it has more flavor than tabasco.
297;K cups disfigured and unusable;Love the flavor, but 12 of the cups in the 24 count box were misshapen/melted, as if they'd been exposed to heat during filling.  My husband used two of the ones that were not affected, so I'm not returning them, but certainly wish quality control had caught this.
298;Very good tea;Very good robust flavor. Excellent with milk or cream.
299;Pretty Good Treats;These are hard treats shaped like hearts that you can break in half if necessary. They have decent ingredients though I try not to give my dogs anything with grain, the oatmeal and barley flour is not too bad.
300;Can't go wrong with organic;My son gives the carrots 5 stars but isn't a fan of the peas however that's all on the learning tummy of a baby and nothing to do with the product. I've got no complaints.
301;Great taste;This tea will be a staple in my cabinet.  I heard about it by word of mouth, and the reviews weren't exaggerating-- it's great!  I love the smell.
302;An old favorite...;My lab has been eating this for several years now and she likes it allot, we sometimes switch things up and use other brands but always come back to this. It is not your pricey 100% natual type but she has always been healthy and strong with an amazing coat.
303;Healthy, Delicious, Convenient!;So my 3 year old son gulps these down like there's no tomorrow! He loves them. I LOVE them because he's getting spinach a long with a ton of other nutrition.
304;Best tea;This is my favorite everyday tea. I drink at least two cups a day, sometimes more.
305;Doggy Deliciousness;I have one dog, an older beagle/basset mix, and my brother has 2 dogs (both corgi mixes), so we let all three dogs try the FunBites.  The dogs loved them.
306;Perfect as an occasional supplement!;My wife and I bought a couple cans of this food for a few days when we were away from home with our dog. It is a little pricey, but then again this is definitely not meant as a daily meal - it even plainly says on the can to feed supplementally only!<br /><br />PROS<br />- Our dog loves it!<br />- 95% chicken content, no fillers<br />- Perfect for road/camping trips<br />- No gastrointestinal discomfort that we could see<br /><br />CONS<br />- Not human grade meat<br /><br />It is important to understand the difference between quality in meats for dog (and cat) food.
307;Marley Coffee One Love Organic Coffee;This gourmet coffee has an exceptional strong taste with a hint of the exotic floral and berry flavor. The aroma itself enticed me.
308;Taste good - but not as good at Weight Watchers Brand;These pop chips are satisfying and good for a snack, but not what I expected.  They do not taste as good, crisp or as light as the Weight Watchers brand that is so hard to find in stock.
309;Happy Cola;Always fresh and tasty, love em !!!! These take me back to my youth when I tasted these bottles for the first time ..
310;Good salt;Love this salt. Was very hard to find in stores and Amazon made it easy.
311;Excellent coffee;Great tasting coffee.  I use two pods because I like it strong.
312;Chocolate lovers will like this one;Very chocolate and raspberry just like the name says. Buy it and enjoy it.
313;Soft, sweet, flavorful!;I usually toss a small handfull of raisins in my oatmeal in the morning.  For years, I have purchased Sun-Maid products without complaint.
314;One of childhood favorite cookies;Crepes arrived in great shape, didn't appear to have any crumbled cookies from the delivery process. Love the plain crepes, but really LOVE the dark chocolate crepes even more.
315;Bad Packing;Compare to other packing I will give 5 out of 10. It's a food product that should be pack properly.
316;must have one everyday;I love the cranberry bar. It has the right about of crunch and sweetness.
317;Too expensive;Theses are great treats. My dog loves them.
318;Not A Pack Of Four;I have not tasted this oatmeal yet but I do anticipate it to be very good.  It did not come as a four pack though.
319;Yummmm;I got hooked on pumpkin seeds about 1 year ago. They are also very good for you.
320;Just OK, not worth the $;Tangerines are my favorite.  Thought I would love it.
321;Great Japanese Snack;"These ""potato sticks"" are a great alternative to potato fries, they are one of my favorite snacks here.  They're like fries and chips in one, if you like crunchy snacks you should give these a try."
322;The Best Senseo Coffee!;My husband and mother did not like the coffee from the Senseo coffee maker. I was about to throw the pot out, then I gave the Kona pods a shot.
323;very good;Bought this a month ago and it seems to be working very well for my dogs and me.  My dogs can not have any wheat or corn and it is hard to find a dog food at a reasonable price that contains neither.
324;Flavored crystal light;I think if I were to like crytal light better, I might enjoy this more.<br />Crytal light is very sour to me and very fake tasting in my view.
325;Used to be the only way I could get veggies down my baby!;Before trying these pouches, I would attempt to hide veggies in my daughter's baby cereal and fruit puree.  I could put the tiniest bit in her bowl and she would always detect it.
326;My little guy loves these;My little guy LOVES these puffs. Whenever he throws a fit or refuses to eat, we give him a handful of these puffs and he immediately complies with the task at hand.
327;:/;beautiful plant i loved it..
328;Great;I bought this flavor for the first time at the store, when they were out of my favorite (Sweet N Hot). My kids (ages 4 and 2) were begging me for some when we got back to the car.
329;ancho peppers;These are the freshest dried peppers I have had since I lived in Texas. Difficult to find in PA groceries, but hard and brittle when you do, these arrived in airtight jars with that pliant feel you want in a pepper that has been packed right after drying.
330;Too Salty for Me!;I'm really disappointed in these, unless for some reason I got a bad box of them!  I've been buying the plain Pop Chips for over a year now, very happy with them but was looking for something new.  Well, these are too salty for me,,,,,I can't eat them.
331;super super yummy chips, minus the guilt -- Salt & Pepper;These Popchips are my absolute favorite. I love Popchips because they are super-crispy and light.
332;Bellagio Sipping Chocolate;I've been trying lots of different sipping chocolates trying to find the perfect cup for me.  I don't feel that Bellagio Sipping Chocolate is the one, but it rates high on the list of favorites.
333;Kitty crack!;All 3 of my cats love these! I buy lots of treats and some of them they just won't even eat. Or one likes them and the other two don't or whatever.
334;Tea with a Punch;I usually drink non-caffeine herb tea and just plain mint is one of my favorites. I can't stomach chamomile, so I'm pleased this tea does not have that ingredient.
335;cat food - organic;"<a href=""http://www.amazon."
336;Great Sweetner;Love this it has a unique flavor. I will purchase more to keep in stock at home.
337;Delicious & Easy;We bought the variety kit so that we could try multiple flavors & we love them all.  They are easy to use & make great tasting jerky.
338;Carefully enjoy;These little curled lamb treats can make decent treats for most dogs. They soften up quickly, unlike rawhide, yet can be enjoyed longer than a biscuit because of their consistency.
339;GOOD STUFF!;My boyfriend has high blood pressure so I have to be careful what I use to season ribs, etc., especially when we smoke meats.
340;Gluten free;Glutino Gluten free pretzel sticks taste as good as pretzels with wheat flour.<br />The crunch and texture are excellent.
341;Better than Arizona Iced Tea Stix (gasp!);I am hooked on Arizona Peach Iced Tea Stix. I have it on auto-deliver because if I run out a serious panic attack ensues.
342;Nice value and my dog says they taste great!;These treats smell fabulous and my snoopy little beagle gobbles them right up..
343;Graham Crackers in Convenient Packaging;These are fairly typical graham crackers, which I enjoyed well enough.  Conveniently, they are wrapped in small packs, which is nice for packing lunches, etc.
344;Loma Linda Big Franks;I've been mainly vegetarian for over 35 years. I've tried many veggie hotdogs.
345;YUM;Some of the best burgers I have had made at home in a long long time. The meat is extremely good I think the people who rated it 1 star and said it was terrible must be haters or competition.
346;Will buy more;Quaker Soft Baked Oatmeal Raisin cookies taste closest to homebaked cookies than any others I have tried. My kids loved them, too.
347;Yummy!;I bought these when I couldn't find the Choco-Koala cookies we usually buy. These are great little cookies and seem just like the Choco-Koala cookies.
348;A 'Flavorite' Treat;Very tasty and great for a late night snack, a sitting at your desk snack, and/or a traveling treat . If you're not a big fan of salty treats, steer clear.
349;Pleased;Delivery was fast, and my order arrived intact and unbroken. The product was of very good quality.
350;cat doesn't actually eat it;My cat usually can't get enough of his daily wet food, but he won't eat this stuff.  He completely licks all the sauce off and leaves the entire bulk of the food.
351;Good drink;A good cup of hot chocolate..
352;Good Coffee;My family started buying this for camping trips, now we even drink it at home.  I think it has a clean taste, and the price is right.
353;great product, great price;
354;WOW!!!  This stuff is GREAT!!!;"My title says it all.  I thoroughly enjoyed this ""Chocolate Delight"" granola -- as did my wife and my oldest daughter."
355;Great tasty snack;Working on a low carb, higher protein health plan.  I like a number of the Think Thin bars.
356;fabulous popcorn;There are very seldom any unpopped kernels, which is nice and the flavor is wonderful. Not a whole lot to say about popcorn.
357;Refreshing;I have tried a bunch of coconut waters. This one is in the top three for strait coconut water.
358;Agave, natural sweetner is just okay;I can attest that the product gives an initial taste of being really sweet, but it seems to have a lingering aftertaste to it. It looks like regular honey but is not as dense.
359;a bit on the stale side;Expiration date 1-13. Smashed and.
360;My Newfie loves it!;We decided to get a Newfoundland puppy and brought him home, prior to this I had researched dog foods and decided to go with holistic select giant and large breed puppy[the food he was being fed at the breeder wasn't available around us or online]. I had done the gradual switch from his food to the new food and after days of diarrhea and a vet visit and researching, I decided to change his food to this.
361;Love it!;The closest thing to Danish licorice that I've been able to find online.  Went through all 6.
362;Wonderful anise flavor...;I tried these five years ago at a Greek cafe. They're sweet, with the pungent flavor of anise.
363;**warning**;I am an avid tea drinker and drink a wide variety of teas. I am a huge fan of Hibiscus tea and wanted to try this mix.
364;Better than expected!;"I was nervous after reading some of the reviews about the taste of this and/or quality, but after having been consuming this for a couple days, I really do enjoy it!  Initially I thought it would be gross, but it really wasn't!  It is nice with the fruit in it, and has a kind of ""nutty"" taste. Great shipping, great quality, amazing nprice, and I def."
365;Addictive!;I've never been a big fan on chips. When it comes to snack foods, I'm more of a pretzel guy, or maybe something cheesy.
366;Good value, good taste;This is really delicious and not something you can find in the local grocery store.  If you did it would be very expensive and a much smaller quantity.
367;Strong and Bold;Caribou Blend is my top rated. The flavor is bold and smooth with a wonderful aroma.
368;Great stuff;Reading the reviews for this tea, I was skeptical, but made the purchase anyway.  Really glad I did.
369;Wild Salmon...;The cannery which produces this pink salmon for Roland, produces for majority of the sellers selling pink salmon. Costco sells the worst tasting canned pink salmon, these are much better.
370;Right Box, Wrong Tea;I really love this tea, it's my favorite. I like the mildly sweet flavor, and it is a medium strength tea, not too weak and not too strong.
371;Nutiva Hemp Protein + Fiber;This is the best protein powder drink I have ever tried..
372;great basic color kit;These Ateco colors are wonderful and blend into batters and icings seamlessly.  This is a good basic kit to start with.
373;Only way to make chili;Fresh chili calls for fresh ground Cumin, and lots of it. Pre-ground Cumin just doesn't taste the same.
374;Fantastic Product;I recently started my own ice cream and snack truck and have been trying different products out. This brand is easily my favorite.
375;Saw dust favor;Thsi are hard to eat..
376;Jello sugar free cook + serve pudding;Really great. I wish D-zerta pudding was still being made but this is a great substitute.
377;Wrong photo;The picture on your ad is not a black walnut.  It is an english walnut.
378;Mini Pretzels;I had been looking for these unsalted pretzels for awhile.  I try to limit sodium, but love pretzels.
379;yummmm;i love this stuff! and it was such a great deal! cereal + saving money = happy mommy. it arrived at my house in perfect condition.
380;favorite cookies;I stumbled upon these in my local grocery store last year and decided to give them a try as they looked similar to my favorite cookies that I used to buy in Germany (Speculatius).  Love Love Love these!  They're not quite as thin as the German ones, but they're the same rich consistency and fabulous with a cup of tea.
381;Wonderful and flavorful;I love this tea. I ordered some 100 ct boxes of different teas for our small resort.
382;Absolutely THE BEST;After reading another review of this coffee I gave it a try. Now I won't ever buy another coffee from anywhere else.
383;Great product and GREAT! seller. VERY responsive to my questions.;A very handy product for these times. With this seed, I will have an unending supply of new seed/wheat/bread.
384;Definitely Bold;I really enjoy this coffee.  I enjoy a strong cup of coffee, and this fits the bill on the medium or small cup setting.
385;Great product;This is a great way to get dogs to take their pills willingly. My dog is very picky, but he thinks these are treats regardless of the pills inside.
386;Very good instant coffee;"Picked this up on a whim at a big chain store because the coffee looked good compared to the other ""crummy"" instants. As far as instant goes, I think it is the best affordable non-flavored brand on the market."
387;No better than Folgers;I heard so much about this gormet coffee for a resonable price that I just had to try it. What a let down, not only is it over priced even on sale, it doesn't even taste better than Folgers.
388;bal;Bahlsen Delice Cookies, 3.5-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 12)<br />Very Disappointed with your service and deceptive listing of the product ingredients.
389;Excellent Product;This tea is fantastic. For as long as I remember, I've suffered from terrible cramps, jitters, and other unpleasant PMS symptoms.
390;love Kind products;As a lover of Kind bars, I was excited to see this granola. I'm generally not a fan of grains unless they're sprouted grains, but this was great.
391;great for gluten-free breadsticks;I love pretty much all Chebe products. This mix makes really good bread sticks.
392;fragrant;This adds a nice fragrance to cocktails..
393;Convenient, but with an very strange taste;I've purchased Organic Valley's milk for quite some time now, always in the form of half-gallon containers, which taste perfectly fine. So this time I decided to try out the aseptic cartons.
394;Wonderful!;What a surprise! The truffle salt  I ordered was cheaper than it is at my local Whole Foods. It arrived so fast that I could not understand what could possibly be in the package! It said Paul Butler in the return address, which gave me no clue.
395;Great bold flavored K-Cup;This is a great option if you are looking for a bold roast K-Cup. This is my new favorite.
396;Bending my fingers ar last.;Thanks to a tablespoon each morning, I am able to make it through the day with minimal pain in my hands.<br />Unfiltered organic apple cider vinegar has helped me control my appitite, move better and foot pain is gone!<br />I feel I am getting many additional health benifits.
397;Tons of Uses!!;I decided to try this coconut oil after reading tons of blogs about all the different uses it has, and I'm really glad I did!<br /><br />My daughter has a pretty bad case of Keratosis Pilaris on both of her arms, and also her cheeks. I've tried numerous products on her to try to remove the little bumps, but nothing had worked.
398;it smells good!!!!;this product came fast and was sealed, a lot of people dont mention if a product comes sealed or not but you need to know with coconut oil because if you live in a hot state it will be in liquid form and you dont want it spilling all over the place ok now on to the product when i first opened it, it smelled so good and it does kinda smell like roasted nuts but the smell is not too strong to turn you off and then i tasted it but it had no taste and i havent cooked with it because im using it for my body. after i shaved it put some on and it made my skin smooth and mosty importantly it wasnt greasy you just dont know how much i hate greasy oils that sit on top of your skin and do nothing oh and i put this on my hiarline and it made it feel soooo soft, i know in my previous reviews i've said that im giving up on oils but i was just using the wrong ones the whole time and now i've found an oil that gonna be sticking around<br /><br />ps.
399;Actually Gluten-free.  Wooh!;I always approach a gluten-free label with a certain amount of scepticism.<br /><br />DeBoles Pasta, Bob's Red Mill, Rice Dream, Arrowhead Mills, General Mills Rice and Corn Chex, and Mi-Del Gluten Free cookies have all caused me to get a gluten reaction at one time or another.
400;Great, Organic Beef Jerky!;This stuff is delicious..
401;Walker's Shortbread is too good;I first got acquainted with Walkers Shortbread during my first travels to England about 40 years ago.  They were addictive then and even better now.
402;Great product!;Great product.  We love sugar in the raw and its benefits over processed sugar.
403;Real Good;I don't like the taste of many energy/protein bars because many of them have that dense, vitamin-tasting quality about them.  These bars are different.
404;Not so Fondarific;I bought this fondant because the previous buyers gave good reviews. I have worked with fondant before and I have never had trouble putting in on the cake.
405;Incredible;I love sensational flavors and these almonds really deliver.<br />They get sprinkled on many of my Thai dishes, stir fries, and fried rice medleys for extra crunch, calcium, fiber, and protein.
406;Dog loves them;My dogs loves these, and they were helpful with getting him adjusted to his crate at night (I would just drop one in after locking him in). I can't say that they really help to keep his teeth clean, although my husband says that he can smell the mint on the dog's breath after the dog has eaten one.
407;pedigree chicken and rice;Pedigree chicken and rice is good product.  My dogs love it.
408;Incredibly . . .;It does not matter if this product is good or bad.<br />If this company is to STUPID to display the amount of product the buyer gets for the $16.
409;Heaven on Earth;Kept unopened in the freezer for four years. To our delight this dessert preserved perfectly and wish we had another as we cannot locate it locally.
410;Great for the grand-babies;Sent these to the grand-babies for snacks. Reasonably priced, convenient for mom and the babies love them.
411;Insanely good!;I love these puffs. They're crunchy and delicious and sooo flavorful.
412;Love these,but.....;way too much sodium.These are great for dieters 'cause they are low carb but the high salt content offsets that somewhat.
413;decent;this stuff is ok.  I was hoping it was the flakes but it's a very fine powder, like a flour consistency.
414;Expensive, but it worked!;I took in a foster cat almost one year ago and have tried almost everything to rid him of diarrhea.  The vets were unable to diagnose any parasite or physical problems, and his behavior has always appeared happy and healthy.
415;exactly what it say it is, three nuts, three seeds, three berries;This is definitely not my favorite product from Mrs. Mays but still very tasty.
416;Amazing Chutney!!!!;I was born and raised in South-Africa.  This is the orignal Mrs Balls Chutney.
417;Not as good as I'd hoped...;After reading the reviews I was highly excited to try this product.  But, unfortunately, I'm a little disappointed.
418;Really, Really Good Tasting.;I've been looking for some snacks that have food value. I don't mind it if the calories are high, but I don't want just all sugar things.
419;choking hazard;I have an 80 pound Boxer with a big drooly mouth but a soft jaw. He loves raw hides and needs something he can't easily destroy.
420;Something is amiss with the K-cups f;I love the Kahlua K-cup coffee so I thought I'd like Mudslide as well.  I do like it.
421;My guests LOVE this bread!;I run a vacation rental business ([..
422;not real kombucha;This is not real kombucha.  It may have a little bit of kombucha in it, but it is mostly carbonated water and juice.
423;Not very tasty!;I love Arnold Plamer's and Starbucks has the best black tea & lemonade.  I was hooked on them all summer.
424;The cat and the dog love this stuff;I rate this a 4 star because of how it tends to have a great quantity of powdery crumbs in the bottom of the bag. The dog will lick it up, but with a powder, he tends to inhale and cough so I end up with unusable powdery crumbs that I can't give to the dog straight from the bag.
425;I am a coffee lover . . .;. .
426;Great option but...;unfortunately my dog didn't love it. I was under the impression for some reason that it was a softer treat, which my pug prefers
427;Excellent;If you love ginger or any of the other Destrooper cookies, you will like these.  They are light and crispy, not at all like a chewy ginger snap.
428;My kids loved them;My brother's best friend brought these cookies as a gift for him.  My kids got one each.
429;Not just for Celiacs;"Most GF pretzels, cookies, etc. that are trying to be substitutes for wheat products always taste ""off."
430;mixed drinks;This is a really great way to try new drinks without purchasing a large bottle and being dissappointed. Then you can get the large bottles of what you like.
431;Excellent;I had to give up caffeine and I SORELY MISS COFFEE. Like a lot of people who love coffee I used turned my nose up at decaf.
432;Sour baby food;We love the pouch size and the price but this baby food Is sour, although the banana and pumpkin should be sweet components. The color of the puree is a light yellow and not orange as it appears on the box.
433;Miracle Oil;I have only been ingesting this oil and using as a moisturizer for my face, body and hair for a little over a month.  My face and body are hydrated and soft as a baby's butt.
434;great snack;go for it. Light tasty mid morning or afternoon snack.
435;Great quick meal;My 17 month old daughter loves all of these little microwaveable meals, which are great in a pinch and this one has been no exception.  There was a previous post about an expiration date issue, but all orders that I have received the expiration date has been a year out +.
436;A Very Good English Breakfast Tea;I have ordered the Davidson's English Breakfast tea a couple of times now.  I have really enjoyed the flavor.
437;Best Pretzels EVER!;The fact that these pretzels are gluten free is a bonus for sure! I, we..
438;Best Damm Chili on the Market!;This is the best canned chili I have ever eaten.  Mild hot or what ever it's the best, only problem is it's hard to find if you don't live in Washington state or the northwest.
439;Some broken jars;When I saw some of the Earth's Best jars offered as a Gold Box deal, I remembered that I needed to offer a caveat to other parents.<br />  My children have previously enjoyed many Earth's Best flavors, which in general taste quite good, so in February when there was a promotional offer through Amazon, we ordered two 12-packs.
440;Blair's xxx hot salsa;I always love a good challenge in the heat department provided there's the flavor to back it up. This product delivers what it promises with the heat (which is the only reason it got 2 stars), but the taste is so unpalatable it's not worth it.
441;Great Stage 3 Food for Baby;We love this yummy flavor of food for my baby.  He loves the chick chick pouches and it is a go to for us.
442;Truly Disappointing. Product Changed. Not for the better!;We have been buying Caribou Blend K-cups for a couple of years. It is a fine medium blend that we, and everyone that we have served it to, loves.
443;Tasty and wonderful in a wide range of recipes;I bought this from Amazon about six months ago, after reading several Japanese cookbooks and nutrition articles that extol the benefits of the vitamin B and iodine rich kombu seaweed. (American soils are iodine deficient, so this is a good way to get it).
444;corrosive;This soda hurt my teeth. Drank one a day for 6 weeks.
445;Just blah...;It seems the flavor selection on Amazon has been limited these days to some variation of hazelnut, french vanilla or chocolate so when I saw this one, I thought I'd give it a try.  Never having had Wolfgang Puck's k-cups, I was hoping they'd be as good as the Wolfgang Puck coffee I've had in hotel coffeemakers that were a part of my room but alas, I was mistaken.
446;Quick and easy to use;This product was easy to use and blend. I added 1 cup of crushed ice, 1 cup of milk and 1 TBSP of smoothie mix and a half cup of vanilla ice cream in the blender (add more sugar if you like it really sweet) and in less than 5 minutes you'll have a great tasting green tea smoothie.
447;The taste has changed;I am a long-time consumer of Del Monte canned products, and their 100% Juice Sliced Peaches have been my favorite as long as they have been produced.  It has not been uncommon for me to eat an entire can in one sitting, several times a week.
448;Fresh Nutty Nutrition;I heard about the benefits of hemp and ordered this pack.  The seeds came right away and were much smaller than I had thought they'd be.
449;YUM!;"If you are a fan of ""Scooter-Pies"" or ""Moon Pies"", you will love these.  They are smaller but just enough to satisfy your sweet tooth."
450;MY NEW FAVORITE;"My usual grocery store just started carrying these and as I like to buy natural versions of ""junk "" food whenever possible  I tried them.  I'm almost a little sorry I did as I now have a mild addiction to them."
451;Dog Ate For A Couple of Weeks & Then Did Not Want To Eat It!;I have a 7 month old (today 09-15-12) maltese and she is a very picky eater. I have bought several different types of dry dog food and she will eat it for awhile and then eats enough to get by on until I try another brand.
452;I love this relaxing tea!;This is one of my favorite teas.  A nice, relaxing change to my other favorite.
453;Rip off- what you see is not what you get;I feel so totally ripped off.  The package contained 1 ( one) item, the shipping cost was $8.
454;Great!;It actually does taste really good. Moreover, after exercizing, I ate about a handfull (dry) without water.
455;Very Good;These are the best seaweed snacks..
456;Overall Buyer Review;Quick ship, good packaging, glad to see that I could set up an automatic order ..
457;Thought the grayish color was normal...;I've been buying Happy Bellies for the past 6 months (though I didn't use it exclusively..
458;tasty,savory sardines!!!;I noticed that these sardines were available at Whole Foods so I decided to purchase them.  I'm soooooo glad that I did.
459;Great value for egg protein;In general, egg protein doesn't have the best taste.  Since it has a mild flavor, mixing with other ingredients (e.
460;Love these colors;I love the metallic and sheen colors.  In a photo, the items airbrushed with the silver and gold look real.
461;An all-time favorite;I love this dressing.  If you like a tangy dressing with a good amount of garlic and flavor - give this a try.
462;Our dog loves them!;Freeze-dried liver treats are easy to carry around in a treat pouch, don't have to be refrigerated and, so far as I know, are healthy, high-protein snacks without a lot of chemical additives and preservatives. All of those attributes are nice but wouldn't be so important if the dog didn't like them.
463;Sophisticated flavor;This long grain and wild rice blend is seriously delicious! My wife and I have been eating this for years, with all kinds of main courses.  Mahatma makes great rice products, but this one, along with their spicy yellow rice, top the list.
464;Coating in water reservoir flaking off;I guess it's true that ignorance is bliss. I loved using my new Brezza these past couple of weeks.
465;Not a blueberry to be found;The waffles taste good and have a crispy exterior.The problem is the berries.
466;best beef jerky i've ever had;"We bought the 2.5 oz ""original"" recipe package for $3."
467;Great Beef Jerky!;Can't beat the price on Amazon for this jerky. Its thin and still has that Oberto taste that is so good.
468;Tea That Is Good For The Heart;Jasmin Blossom Green Tea Has Been Verified By Many Doctors To Help Reduce The Risk Of Heart Attacks. And Has Very Good Flavor.
469;Good, quick nutrition;All of the Erin Baker cookies are a good alternative to protein and energy bars for a pre or post-workout snack when you need something portable and easy to eat.<br /><br />As far as taste goes, I have no problem with them.
470;the best!!;Green Mountain's Pumkin Spice is the best! I bought a few bottles of pumpkin syrup..
471;Tasty, Lean, and Insanely Addictive;Little morsels of moist, pure beef that taste like high quality roast.  I got the Teriyaki by accident - I normally don't like teriyaki ANYTHING - but the only hint of added flavoring on these is a little sweetness.
472;Awesome Product;Again, this is a great product and company. Other brands of this type do not come up to my standards, and this actually tastes good.
473;Great Coffee!;We've finished our second 2 lb. bag of this coffee and it's great.
474;Excellent bar!;These bars have a great taste!  Just the right amount of chew, wonderful texture.  I will be purchasing these again.
475;Convenient;This was the first time that I have used Barilla so I was interested to see how it was.  I do have mixed feelings.
476;Perfect!;I have been using these bags for a few weeks now and love them. I think other reviewers have really said it all, so I won't waste your time repeating everything in great detail.
477;Consistantly Great;I have been using this since I was a kid daily and now my kids use it, great stuff. So glad to find it on Amazon in the Canister since I don't drink it as strong as the instructions suggest and its hard to find it in the canisters in the stores.
478;Best value for quality k-cup coffee!;From the moment I cut open the sealed bag containing the coffee pods, I could appreciate the quality of this coffee, as the wonderful aroma enveloped my senses.  The coffee taste only bolstered my appreciation, as the flavor was rich and delicious.
479;Problems with consistency;"<a href=""http://www.amazon."
480;Melted.;I ordered 2 4lb bags, and they were delivered today. I open the box and both bags are melted.
481;"Not as good as the ""Wild"" flavor";"These are tasty but not nearly as good as the ""Original Wild"" flavor. They were also quite stale when they got to me."
482;LOVE LOVE all his seasonings;Fabulous, I use them all and some I buy by the canister and share with friends. Everything tastes better with magic.
483;thank goodness for Amazon.;I have two picky dachshunds that only eat certain foods.  They really liked this brand the first time I bought it from a local dog store on Maui.
484;The real thing!!!!;If you want the best espresso coffee used in Italy ,,and i know ,i was born and raised there,,,then Lavazza espresso is the one..
485;I Love IT;I love these bars. They are healthy, tasty, filling, and worth every penny.
486;One of the better K-Cups for the Kuerig;I generally find that many of the K Cups lack the flavor and strength I like. This is one of the few I keep in the rotation.
487;Emerald Forest Ricochet Mints, Mixed Case;"<a href=""http://www.amazon."
488;The best Gummy Bears in the World;I love Haribo!!!!  In my opinion gummy bears should not be fruit snacks--they should be gummy bears: that unique taste and consistency which is found only in gummy bears.  Haribo gummy bears are hands down the best gummy bears on the planet because they are real gummy bears! They are not so soft and chewy like a fruit snack and they are not hard and sticky like Jujubes.
489;Salt water taffy;This arrived fast and on-time.  The taffy extremely soft and fresh.
490;Nice flavor, but very weak;The aroma is pleasant, and flavor is nice and smooth, but it is very, very weak.  I really wanted to like this one as there are very few available on subscribe and save, but I just cannot recommend it.
491;This is the stuff, ya'll!;If you are going to make hummus, this is what you want to use.  High quality, reasonable price, and free shipping.
492;Nice refreshing light taste;The soda was very refreshing.  It did not have the overpowering sweetness of other sodas.
493;Great price on hard-to-find tea!;My 18-year-old son loves hot tea and Lady Grey is one of his favorites. Our local source stopped carrying it, and we searched the stores in surrounding towns but could not find it.
494;excellent choice;Great choice for your Purim gift list..
495;Root Beer lovers will like it, Birch Beer lovers will worship it!;"I couldn't find this product anywhere in stores in CT or New York City.  That qualifies it in my book as really ""hard to find""!  This has the distinctive taste of birch beer without the edge that can be found in some birch beers."
496;My favorite k cup;My favorite Flavored coffee!!! This is not available in any of my local stores.  Better price than I have found at any local stores as well.
497;Excellent training treats - Perfect for my goldendoodle pup;Zuke's Chicken Flavored Mini treats are perfect for training dogs, especially a puppy in my case.  I picked these treats for my new 8 week old goldendoodle puppy.
498;Baby, Toddlers and Adults love it;Friends who feed their 1 year old primarily with this product introduced us to Baby Gourmet Organic.  We gave it a try - and young and old like it - my 4 year old as well as my 7 year old said they like it.
499;These Apricots Aren't Dried Properly;One star.  These Apricots aren't dried all the way through.
500;Love Chicken Pasta Roni;Chicken pasta roni has always been a favorite for me and my husband.  With in the last 2 months, we have been unable to buy this product at any of our local stores.
501;Coffee;The coffee arrived very quickly and it was very good.  I was very pleased and would buy it again from this company.
502;An absolute staple.;"For the eco-friendly, anti-corporate, slacker ""freegan"", this is the ultimate bachelor grub.<br /><br />Make it with soy milk and ground veggie burger crumbles for a sweet meal."
503;Wonderful!;These are the only brand of treats my cat will eat. She loves them! Prior to finding them on Amazon I would get them at local stores but it is so much cheaper to buy them through Amazon.
504;Puppy Pleaser;My dog loves these, perfect size, and he is always looking with longing at the bag. They also aren't very messy, as the bone is very soft, it still does not create a lot of small crumbs, but rather large chunks that get eaten up.
505;Excellent- but do yourself a favor and try them from the fridge!;I loved these cookies when I first tried them, but found that in the humidity they will get soggy and gross if left open for too long.  Easily fixed with a Ziploc, but one time I tossed them in the fridge to keep them extra fresh.
506;Yum!;Thought this tea would have been more bitter, but it is surprisingly pleasant to drink without sweeteners!  Less bitter than a black or earl grey tea.  The pack of 3 is a wonderful deal as well.
507;Great price but...;These lollipop's are definitely are a good value. For the amount in the package and the price, they are great party favors.
508;Cats are obligate carnivores;Whole peas may seem appetizing to a human but to cats, they're junk food. Cats get all their nutrition by eating the whole animal.
509;Great buy;I love this quinoa. The best price.
510;Barista K Cups;This is one of the best K cups out there. Nice bold flavor.
511;Delicious and easy to prepare!;My son loves Maple Brown Sugar Cream of Wheat so when I was offered to try the Quaker Maple Brown Sugar Oatmeal I jumped at the chance to offer him something different.  It was a huge hit!  It was super easy to prepare.
512;Not his best but still good;I like the convience of the McDougall soups.  This is not my favorite.
513;My puppy loves them!;My german shepherd loved these. She is taking antibiotics and has no appetite, we can barely get her to eat anything at all.
514;Makes my cats wish they had opposable thumbs;I have 2 cats.  One is of the garbage disposal variety.
515;Black Tea is Beautiful;I am a major fan of tea and black tea is especially known for its health properties.  It regulates blood sugar
516;Awesome stuff;Ahhhhh It tastes so good. I'll definately have to order some more once I run out it's so good.
517;Great after a workout;I read reports of this being more beneficial for you after a workout when compared to other sports drinks. Well I can attest to feeling much better after drinking this.
518;It's mango-y;This isn't bad.  I used to like Kool-Aid when I was a kid, especially the red flavors.
519;Excellent Product;Perfect for smoothies! I didn't recognize any kind of taste or aftertaste, which is exactly what I was looking for. It didn't upset my stomach and was easy to digest.
520;Organix Cat Food;I have three cats, one with a very sensitive stomach.  Am in the process of switching them from a prescription diet that they have been on for a long time (since the one cat had serious stomach problems) to Organix products.
521;Tazo Organic Spicy Ginger Tea - LOVE!;I love this tea.  It's delicate.
522;Our Favorite After Cheesy Hashbrown;This is our 2nd favorite HH flavor. The flavoring is like the meat tastes in a Philly Cheesesteak (surprise) and the topping is French Fried Onions.
523;Great coffee;I enjoy a bold, savory cup of  and this product fits the bill. This is my favorite ofseveral I have tried.
524;The Best!;Our Sheltie absolutely loves these treats and they are great for his joint conditioning. We've been using them for over a year with excellent results.
525;Use By Date;This is a good buy if you will be eating or giving away the candy within 5 months of purchase. The use by date on the packages I received May 2010 is October 2010.
526;never gets old!;We ordered this for our annual movie-a-thon we have in our driveway on Halloween..
527;Excellent Ginger Tea;I recently gave up coffee, but still felt I needed a little boost first thing in the morning.  The nice spicy ginger tea is great for waking me up and love the lemon-ginger flavor.
528;Excellent!;I love all the Lindt bars but the chili and the sea salt are my top two favorites followed by the orange and the coconut white. All are very high quality melt on your tongue decadent chocolate.
529;Delicious and Functional;Pricey, but it works very well for pan frying.  It has a distinct coconut flavor, so keep that in mind before you buy it
530;Love it;It's NOT cheap, but I like it.  It's easy to use.
531;The best bean for espresso;I am going to reveal my secret for the most awesome cup of coffee, guaranteed to make any woman love you.<br /><br />1.
532;Syrup for the espresso lover;Can't argue with the price.  Have been using this brand for several years and always come back to it.
533;Interesting taste;I read about the benefits of Pau D'Arco tea and decided to give it a try. It's hard to find this tea in the market.
534;Great coffee at a great price;Of course I was hooked on the more expensive coffee beans..
535;Toxic Ingredients?;I used to buy these in bulk and finally great tired of finding dried glue caked on the elbows in the box.  I've had the same problem with the shells from Annie's.
536;Decent, but not great;When I first started to use IAMS Savory Sauce, my dogs loved it. After a few weeks, they don't seem to care too much for it anymore.
537;Bow Wow!;This is a great food for my little shih tzu. Amazon has a great price, and he can't tell the difference between the store bought and the delivered version of the product, except he gets to bark at the delivery man and loves to play with the box it comes in (since it smells like food).
538;Smells better than it tastes, but it tastes better good;I love them crackers especially with cresm cheese.  My husband is addicted to them too.
539;Chocolov is to love;The chocolate bars arrived on time packed with an icebag and in a nice box which makes it easily accessible to get one at a time.  It is delicious 70% chocolate which I have had before and am enjoying again.
540;taste is ok, but too tough;I became a fan of dried shiitake mushrooms upon buying them at Costco. Since the Costco does not always have it in stock, I tried these.
541;A Good Dairy Free Option;I have started drinking Rice Dream (RD) this year and I really enjoy it. It is a great option for those who are lactose intolerant and need to live a dairy free lifestyle.
542;Insane Pricing;I thought I was paying for a case of this product but I actually paid $10.68 for one small can of cat food.
543;Many cats love this toy, but the dye leaks into their water...;At our animal shelter, this toy is a big favorite.  It is shiny, colorful, lightweight and makes a crinkling sound when crushed or batted.
544;This is not the right Lavazza coffee;What I received is not the real Lavazza coffee and I should know since I am from Italy and from the same area where this coffee is produced. When I opened the can, there was no coffee smell and when I made a cup it did not taste like the real thing.
545;suitable for my purposes;My boyfriend and I were each over 430 lbs because we ate Mcdonalds every day but then we slimmed down to around 160 in about 3 weeks, and that's because we switched to south beach diet. I eat the almond chocolate bars as my sole source of sustenance and I continue to have results.
546;Real deal? Not a chance.;Shocked to see so many positive reviews for this product. As another reviewer said the ingredients are: horseradish, turmeric, spirulina.
547;BEST MINTS MY FAMILY AND MY HUNTING LODGE MEMBERS HAVE EVER HAD.;MY SON INTRODUCED ME TO YOUR WONDERFUL MINTS AND I LOVED THEM SO MUCH I ORDERED THEM FOR MY FAMILY. THEY WERE WELL RECEIVED SO I TOOK SOME DOWN TO MY HUNTING LODGE.
548;this really works;5 hour energy really works. It makes you awake and aware but without feeling jittery, and there's no crash.
549;Its not all that and its way over priced;Sorry but u can get rip it at the $.99 store that does just as good if not better.
550;Grew fine, but cats not interested;I followed the instructions on the back of the bag and these grew just fine. It took nearly a week for them to start poking through the soil, but they have grown up well and are a very attractive shade of green and are healthy.
551;Sugar free syrup;This is one I use all the time, love these syrups.  Wish strawberry sf would come in 3 packs on sale.
552;Too much of a licorice smell and taste;Well, I understand that since it is Licorice Spice tea it would have some licorice smell and taste, but it is just too much for me. If you use 1 bag of it in your cup you are getting light yellow liquid with a very strong licorice taste and smell.
553;High Quality Food.;I highly recommend this food and the treats as well.  All dogs like it and it is really good for them.
554;Outstanding!;The best part of Slap Ya Mama is that although it gives the dishes spicy flavoring, it's entire claim to fame isn't the heat. It has a great taste without overpowering the food flavors with heat so bad that it will clear out your sinuses for weeks!<br />I have been using it for 7 years ever since I found it in a tuck stop store in Lake Charles LA.
555;twinings english breakfast;We love this tea.  Can
556;Great tea!!;If you like tea, this is one of the best other than Typhoo. Great English tea with a clearly different flavor and better than any you would find on your supermarket shelf.
557;Unbelievably wonderful;Far more complexity than the supermarket stuff.  I keep it in the fridge and find myself sneaking little sips from time to time.
558;crunchy giraffes;All of the Snackimals varieties are a treat -- crunchy, satisfying, and fun to eat.  I like the Wheat-Free variety best, but vanilla is a close second.
559;Dog's Completely Enjoy This Toy!;This dog toy puzzle comes assembled (which I completely appreciated) and was easy and straight forward to set up for our two dogs. It truly put our Rottweiler's problem solving skills to the test and proved to be quite interactive and entertaining for our German Shepard.
560;Beautiful wonderful tuna;I was buying the Star Kist Select low sodium chunk light  but when it became temporarily unavailable I ordered this tuna instead.  It is every bit as good as the Star Kist.
561;A bit more protein a bit less wheat;First, I do have to say our dog Mitzi (a black Chow) enjoys the biscuits and the size is no problem for her, even though she is only 40lbs (small for a Chow). I can't tell if it actually removes tartar, but I am giving it an extra star for that if it does.
562;coffee to wake the dead;Double Black Diamond is a strong cop of joe. I'm not a morning person, but this DBD coffee gets me going at 5:30 AM.
563;Bright but not as large as I wanted.;Bright but not as large as I wanted. Was hoping for a larger size but the kids loved them.
564;I would pass;We did a taste test with Snackwell Fudge Drizzle Caramel Popcorn and 1 out 3 liked the popcorn. We found it had an after taste and was a weird texture.
565;Yummy Candy Corn;Candy Corn is my favorite candy.  This was the best!  Many years ago, I would get candy corn and peanuts and eat them together.
566;Babies love these!;We get these and a similar product from Trader Joe's - our baby has been eating these since she was 8 months old and they've been a lifesaver.  Easy to eat, closeable, portable, and all natural - can't go wrong!  Easier than baby food & a spoon, cleanup is a snap and she loves all the flavors we've tried so far.
567;My favorite;These things are delicious and addictive..
568;These chips will make you fat;But you will enjoy ever step. I gained 5 lbs within a month of buying this 12 pack of full sized bags.
569;My dogs favorite treat;I bought the everlasting treat for mine and my sisters dog.  Both dogs devoured them and for our picky dogs that gives this treat a 5 star rating.
570;Dog loves it;This Nylabone is pretty much indestructible. My German Shepherd has been chewing on it for almost 9 months, and it's still holding up.
571;bring back the butter!!!;"Barbara's animal cookies used to taste good.  I think they have tried to make them more ""healthy"" which has resulted in a tasteless, boring cookie."
572;good but on the bland side;I've been getting most of our soba from a local Vietnamese grocery store and although we've gotten some great stuff there, it seems hit or miss with the brands they carry so I thought I'd try good old Amazon for soba.  This one has a much better consistency than some we've had, but it is paler in color and the flavor is not quite as bold as what we remember eating in Japan, and what we've sometimes been able to get here.
573;My cat won't eat anything else;These treats are my cat's favorites.  When my local market stopped carrying them I was not happy.
574;Omni Palm oil;I bought a case of these bottles and that is A LOT of palm oil. I gave away a few since it is hard to come by, being from Africa and living in California not easy to find african products.
575;This is a favorite tea;I like this tea a lot.  I use it for iced tea as well, it adds a light mint tone to it.
576;Youndoo is so versatile, I can't do without it!;I use Sempio whenever I can get it. &#65279
577;A yummy little snack;This is a little bit of portion control heaven.  These cocoa roast almonds are really a delicious treat in many ways with crunch and a solid deep chocolate and almond taste with just the right amount of sweetness.
578;Love it!;I became addicted after the first order. Smooth taste and has the power to jump start my morning.
579;8 O'Clock Coffee Italian Roast;Great tasting coffee at a very reasonable price. It used to be vacuum packed for freshness.
580;AS GOOD AS IT GETS;I HAVE BEEN DRINKING MALT OVALTINE FOR OVER 20 YEARS. WITH ALL THE VITAMINS AND MINERALS, I USE IT AS MY SUPPLEMENT TO CALCIUM.
581;Taylor Ham -- Amazing Taste;Taylor ham was part of my childhood growing up in New Jersey. Every diner on Route 9, 35 and 36 served it.
582;Terrible gas;I started my Golden Retriever on this food..
583;Absolutely LOVE this versitile mustard, BUT ...;..
584;tastes great;the dried blue berry are a little chewy but they taste great. I add them to my Special K in the morning.
585;Outstanding Service, Teas, and Shipping;Ohhh..
586;Greenies for Owen;Our Newf Owen is a Senior citizen now so wanted to switch him over to a treat that fit his mature lifestyle.  He loves these just as he did the regular Greenies.
587;a tip for keeping zukes fresh on the go;TIP: My little guy really loves the Zukes Mini peanut butter treats. I always keep a little stash with me wherever we go
588;Terrible item!;When I opened the jar I was very disappointed because the jar was NOT filled with anchovy fillets. The fillets were pushed against the side of the jar so looking at the packaging it looked full but the center of the jar was just filled with olive oil!! I feel ripped off.
589;G.F. Tastes Wonderful!;These G.F.
590;Good maple syrup;Very good maple syrup, I received two 32 oz jugs 3 days after placing my order, and paid for it with my Amazon gift card.<br />Lower price than maple syrup in grocery store, but higher than Costco's<br />Brown's maple syrup is from Vermont, and Costco's is from Canada, I can not tell the different between these two.
591;Excellent but shipping!;So very impressed with the nuts. Flavor and not one bad one so far.
592;Great flavor, no calories;I alternate between this and crystal light lemonade for the gym.  I find it makes the water much more interesting and stops me getting dehydrated because I actually finish the water bottle.
593;Fragrance and flavor are perfect!;They have added a touch of lemongrass to this tea, which puts off an unbelievable scent and adds a nice natural flavor to the tea.  Overall, it is a mellow tea though, not sweetened or artificial tasting in the slightest.
594;Good pumpkin, bad cans!;This product is really good pureed pumpkin, but I have a problem with the cans.  I took out one can from the outside of the case to make pumpkin bread.
595;Not Bad Coffee for the Price, Howerver;The coffee taste great and for the price you cannot beat it. However, not sure yet how well it works in our Keurig coffee maker.
596;Better Than the Best Homemade;As you open the tab, the aroma wafts up and tantalizes your nose.  The flavor is beyond any other broth you have tasted.
597;She must be a picky eater.;My cat barely touches this stuff, especially after the can's been open for about a day or two. This is probably because she was most likely raise on cheap food (we adopted her as an adult) but I can't be sure.
598;Tasty but tiny;I have been a fan of Nature's Path for several years, but their prices are so high and their boxes have gotten so small that I am giving up.  The cereal itself is good for what you get.
599;Not as acidic as some;Beans are quite dark
600;Yummy for Fido;My Cousin's dog loved these. She kept stealing blueberry muffins so we thought these would be perfect for her, and they were! The treats are small in size, but you can give several and not feel guilty about it.
601;Great cookie, crazy high price;I've really enjoyed these cookies, and came to Amazon as this one is hard to find. Much to my SHOCK the price is 60+ dollars.
602;Arguably but not defintively Better than Greenies;My dog loves these. The doggie store suggested to me that these were more effective than greenies in cleaning teeth but who knows.
603;Three sticks and maybe a leaf;"This ""full-leaf"" tea has far more twigs than leaves, let alone buds. You have to use a lot of it to get anything other than extremely weak tea."
604;2.5 yr old and 11 month loves this flavor the most;I am a dad who likes to get things in bulk so I can stock up and save while getting quality stuff for my kids. My wife does the picking of which organic stuff we buy.
605;Best Deal in Town;I'm so happy with this purchase! Not only are the Veggie Stix great, but the portion control is so easy this way. AND the price is right, too.
606;You gotta try this!;"If there is a better canned tuna I haven't tasted it. I've been eating ""name brand"" solid white tuna for years and this completely blows that away."
607;Excellent Brew;I like the darker roast coffees and this fits the bill.  This is every bit as good as Deidrich and Tulley's but typically costs more.
608;Not That Dark;Was hoping for a darker, richer roast.  Ground it fine, coarse, brewed it with 3 kinds of water and still couldn't get it strong enough.
609;A great tea!;This is a really good tasting tea and I should know! Having lived all over the world I love many English teas and this definitely great. I brew each k-cup twice into a big mug and it works well.
610;Not what it's made out to be, unfortunately;I purchased this soda from my local health food store, thinking that because it came from a health food store and claimed to be 'natural', that it didn't use GMO ingredients (yes, I know, I was naive, lol) . After reading some of the comments here, especially the one about the ingredients not being as advertised by the company, I decided to do some research.
611;Is there such a thing as too chocolaty? Yes.;I love chocolate. If a manufacturer wants to guarantee that I'll toss a box of their product into the basket at the grocery store, just add some chocolate.
612;Tea Tasted Old;This product was by far inferior to the same tea I bought at the tea store.  It doesn't even smell the same.
613;blue gel paste;it was smaller than I expected after getting the large brown gel bottle. Perfect color, shipped quickly and packaged well.
614;Great Coffee, Great Price;Gloria Jean's Coffee is delicious. Hazelnut is my favorite flavor.
615;Bitter;Chasing that wonderful Pumpkin Spice Latte' flavor I tried almost every conceivable concoction ..
616;Apple chips;You can't go wrong with these. They are delicious, but don't expect them to last long.
617;indoor plant bambo with container;When this came it I found it actually beautiful and very worth the money I paid for it. I will most likely but more shortly.
618;Teeccino is terrific;My wife Bonnie has been drinking Teeccino for about a year now and absolutely loves it.  It's healthy, tasty and can be brewed like any coffee product.
619;The go anywhere snack;A great price. I was fearful that this might be the tiny airline type packages but they are the full blown store counter size.
620;By Far The Best Jack Links!;I love beef jerky, its perfect for work, packs tons of protein, easy to eat and store.  I have to say though the price of the stuff locally is insane, the 3oz bags go for up to 7 bucks a piece.
621;Great for babies who love fish!;The salmon is my daughter's favorite Happy Baby flavor.  I like feeding it to her because it adds fish to her diet and I want to keep tuna to a minimum.
622;Good for Kongs;My dogs really enjoy these but I get a little worried when they get down to the last inch or so as I am afraid they will get stuck in their throat..
623;Marketing Gimmick - Focus on easy pour bottle - Substandard olive oil;Buyer beware of this product.  It coagulates and congeals to a thick white paste when chilled.
624;My New Breakfast Choice;I have been eating the Banana Bread Larabars for breakfast each morning, but last week I tried the blueberry muffin Larabars..
625;Value for price is not good, just go to the grocery store;"I thought that ""85 pieces"" seemed like a lot, enough to justify the price. I was wrong."
626;SAD TO SAY-DEFINITELY NOT THE SAME!;I ate my share of Bonomo Turkish Taffy when I was growing up.  They were all good, but vanilla was my favorite.
627;Extremely sweet!;Wow! I used this product for the first time in my oatmeal this morning. It is much, much sweeter than even honey.
628;Nasty;I had high hopes for this product as I want to stay away from whey and soy protein powders, and I think this protein powder does the job, but it tastes so nasty that I can't force myself to drink it. The one time that I did drink a full serving, it left a terrible after-taste that stuck with me for a couple of hours.
629;Diet Aid;I love this popcorn..
630;I hate these because .......;I hate these because I love them so much.<br /><br />Imagine having a box of 60 truffles on your desk.
631;30+ five star reviews cannot lie!;I've made this cake mix a few times now and it is delicious, moist, sweet, and decadent! I sub flax for the eggs and use soy milk and always get an excellent texture. Even those who are not gluten free are delighted when this cake is made - who does not like cake - spice cake, at that! This cake is delicious by itself or served with ice cream, topped with fruit or frosting.
632;Good alternative to quiona for variety in diet;This is very good g-f pasta.  I agree with others and normally prefer quiona, however, I do not enjoy quiona in pasta salads or for cold peanut noodles - too hard when cold.
633;Yummy!;Just got these oatmeal animal cookies and we love them!  These are not like a typical animal cracker - they are more like tiny crunchy granola bars!  They remind me of the oats and honey crunchy granola bars from Nature Valley.  Also love the price - the only place I can buy these is Whole Foods and they are .
634;Above-Average But Not Amazing;"Disclaimer: I brewed this in a <a href=""http://www.amazon."
635;Do snacks get any better than these!?;These delightfully crunchy, light, flavorful, cinnamon sugar coated pecans are heavenly. This is one of my favorite nutty snacks.
636;Great Purchase;Perfect for dieting and taste is outstanding. Price is right and I am multiple purchase customer planning more purchases soon.
637;Crunchy addiction;Crunchy addiction<br /><br />I treat my cats to 8 different Temptations flavors, and they love them all.  I'm sure that giving them different flavors means more to me, than it does to my cats
638;grab one before they're gone!;this popular desert was gone almost as quick as it came out of the oven..
639;Great Value;Wal-mart gets about $14.97 for a 400 pack, do the math, every dollar counts when you on a fixed income like me.
640;Yuck;I heard wonderful things about these noodles, wish I had read all the reviews and not just the ones on the first page. They were awful! My daughter wouldn't even try them but got a good laugh at me trying to eat some.
641;Artificial Sweetener! YUCK!;The artificial sweetener ruined this for me..
642;Expensive, but great product;After trying several other products for freezing baby food, I came accross this item and although I was not thrilled about the price, ordered it and was pleased with the ease of use. The tray is easy to fill, has a working lid, easy to empty once frozen and easy to wash.
643;Perfect...And i dont use that word lightly !;I LOVE THE SMELL TASTE FEEL OF COFFEE ! However as a health issue i dropped all caffiene including my beloved coffee. Oh the Pain.
644;organic...good quality;This is the only organic yeast I have been able to find. It is very good quality.
645;Fantastic;Surprisingly tasty and a great texture.  I was excited to find these in my local grocery store in the Passover section.
646;The Past...they did things different there...;The one lb. tin is well packed and melded together.
647;Just mediocre instant coffee in a K-cup.;This is just plain ordinary instant coffee in a K-cup.<br />No micro-ground fresh flavor.
648;GMO Sumatran Extra Bold;Green Mountain Organic Sumatran Extra Bold K-cups for Keurig Brewers is a rich bold coffee that is not bitter.  I love not wasting coffee by brewing one cup at a time, however, I do wish that the K-cups were a little more environmentally friendly.
649;Delicious;This cider smells and tastes wonderful.  Only 10 calories if you are counting.
650;A pleasing cup of coffee;"I found the taste and strength of this coffee just right for it to gain the honor of one of my ""go-to"" coffees for my Keurig.  Not too strong or bitter, I rather enjoy the flavor."
651;Iams Small biscuits for dogs;Iams dog biscuits are the only ones I give my dog as they are flavorful, crunchy, balanced nutrition and in addition to all that they  make my Lab smile !  She prefers the small size though she is NOT a small size.  She gets two since they are small and thinks she is getting more that way.
652;smart fries;These are a great low calorie and low fat snack.  Satisfies the crunchy craving and sweet craving at the same time.
653;Hubby's new favorite !!!;Hubby loves this K cup flavor!  Sometimes difficult to find..
654;great price;so much less expensive than other brands.  not very informative packaging, though, and who knows if it's organic or what.
655;Do not order this product....;It has been over three weeks and I still have not received this product.  And, they have charged me for it already.
656;Very Fast Shipping;Fast Shipping. This is the first time I ordered this product, although I have bought sweet potato chews for a long time.
657;But what wine goes with this?;If you like cheese glop on rice with chicken cubes and dried broccoli particulate you might like this.<br /><br />Honestly, this would only be enjoyable after a strenuous twenty mile hike in the mountains.
658;Not as Advertised;I ordered these beans, but the ones I received were B&M Homestyle. They do not taste the same! My family does not like the Homestyle variety.
659;Lindor Truffles;I ordered two-60 count boxes for the candy table at my daughter's wedding, knowing that these would be the ultimate! When we opened the box, the truffles were puckered, and chocolate was inside of the ends of the wrappers.  Some so badly (about 27-28), that I could not put them into the candy jar to take to the venue.
660;Awesome, but too much sugar;I could only find these drinks at one random convenience store (which was far away and not convenient) for months and every-time I went there, I stocked up. So excited to see them on amazon.
661;delicious;This is one of my favorite gluten-free, egg-free, and dairy-free breads.  It tends to crumble easily so must be handled gently.
662;Great coffee.. But overpriced..;You're paying for the Kona reputation and marketing, but the 'blends' are really overpriced considering they're just 20% Kona.  The 100% is more worth the price, but you don't need to spend quite so much for comparably great coffee.
663;The Best Dog Pacifiers;These are GREAT..
664;Would have given fewer stars...;These are awful!  Do not waste your money.  My 2 year old daughter is a semi-picky eater so when she wouldn't eat them I tried them.
665;Great cup of Green Tea;This is really a great little green tea. The flavor of the green tea comes through even with the sweetness from the gojiberry and pomegranate seeds.
666;Sulphur Dioxide- Toxic Preservative;This product contains sulphur dioxide as a preservative, which if taken in high amounts could be toxic.  Asthmatics should also be careful of products with sulphur dioxide, including many dried fruits.
667;not a fan;I did not enjoy this coffee. This is more of that old world kind of beverage.
668;Love Caribou!;I ordered the Mahogany Caribou Coffee K-Cups and adore them.  I recommend this product if you like bold coffe with a smooth taste.
669;So yummy !!!!!;My favorite flavor of kind bar.  The dark chocolate is not too sweet and the fruity/nutty textures and flavors really shine.
670;Dog loves them;The dog really loved these bones and it seemed to freshen her breath.  It was a good treat for a dog with tummy troubles.
671;A taste of Australia;I took one bite of my first try of this flavor and boy did it take me back! If there is a taste that defines Australia for me the apricot and coconut is it! Runner up would have to be Vegemite. These are GOOD! And I love that they are truly natural and organic.
672;DEEEEE-LICIOUS!!!;I tried this stuff when I was on vacation in the Caribbean.  I am so happy that I was able to find it.
673;The taste of Europe...;I love this flour for European style artisan bread. Makes excellent baguettes, and other crusty breads.
674;Great to be gluten free!;"Every member of the family loves ""mommy pancakes"" made from Pamela's. I'm the only wheat-free, gluten-free person in the household and do a majority of the cooking and baking."
675;Stonewall's has had mold on it lately;I use to buy a lot of this jerquee from Amazon, but for the past two months or more every shipment has been bad.<br />The stuff has been covered in toxic mold, and I had to throw it away and get my money back.
676;Baby loves it!;Our baby has eaten these since she was about 9 months old and still loves them on occasion when we're in a pinch even though she's 18 months now and can definitely eat regular salmon.  We have a particularly adventurous eater (I only think that is due to comparison to friends' similarly aged children) so maybe it's best to try it out before buying in bulk.
677;"""Your're trying to poison me, I just KNOW it""";"My Australian shepherd (AKA ""garbage-gut"") would kill for these. On the other hand she would kill for a chicken strip or a bite of buttered toast so I don't know if you should depend on her for a review."
678;Weight Gain;My dog loved this food and I set up a subscription for it.  After two bags, I can tell significant weight gain.
679;Crackers are still great... 2 stars for packaging;The crackers are the same here as the typical/old boxes except halved.  Still delicious.
680;Not what I was looking for;I was looking for some jasmine extract to make some thai desserts with.  When I opened this bottle of jasmine extract, it sort of smelled like jasmine, but also had some other weird (not so great) smell to it.
681;Our 3 dogs love 'em!;These treats are great! They are enjoyed by our dogs and don't get my hands gooky. (Some treats leave an oil-like layer on the fingers.
682;S'minty GOODNESS!;Yes, this is a lot of loose leaf peppermint! Very fresh and aromatic. The tea leaves aren't too fine so you won't get a lot of tea 'crumbs' in your teacup.
683;Good Stuff!;I gave up coffee about six months ago and had been drinking various types of teas and herba matte since then. I stumbled across Ayurvedic Roast on line and decided to order a bag to see if I liked it.
684;delicious;The tea is absolutely delicious.  I drink it several times a day with honey and I love it.
685;wife's love;"I'm a cafe Lat`e guy every morning and my wife has a chai lat`e. She's tried all the ""major"" coffee shops chai but liked this the best."
686;Good taste, small container;This Olive oil has a pretty good flavor.  I purchased w/ subscribe and save to get a 15% discount.
687;YUCK;I bought this product, based on many positive reviews, and was not satisfied. I got the original flavor, which I followed the directions while preparing it.
688;A class all of it's own. You might eat the spoon!;I love Honey. This Manuka honey (I'm on my 10th jar in three years) is much more mature and smooth than anything I've ever had.
689;A strong yet bitter brew;As a French Roast fan, I bought this brand of K-cup with high expectations, considering the name attached to it. I was disappointed.
690;In like a lion out like a lamb.;These coffee pods smell very strong when you first open them. however
691;Tully's Coffee French Roast K-Cup for Kuerig;This is one of my husband's favorite's.I found it to be less expensive than at GMCR so got it here at Amazon.
692;Moist, plump, exquisite;I spotted this exquisite treat at a local gourmet food store and had to give them a try. Excellent flavor and texture, quite unique.
693;excellent soup mix;This is good stuff.<br /><br />I add a coarsely chopped large onion, a full bulb of crushed garlic cloves, about 1/4 of a 16 oz jar of better than bullion chicken seasoning, a half dozen bay leaves, 2 tablespoons of chopped basil, 2 tablespoons of ground cumin seed, approximately 1 tablespoon of sea salt, a tablespoon of crushed red papper flakes, and enough water so that this fills a 5 quart dutch oven when it's fully cooked.
694;Jamaca me flavorful;Bought this on the recommendation of my son.  Not a big fan of flavored coffee, but a cup a day of this lightly flavored coconut coffee puts me in the islands.
695;5 out of 5 Love the Food;My cat herd (5) love Wellness canned food, especially the turkey mix.  Cat ages range from 3 to l0 and all have thrived on this food.
696;Bold, and full of flavor, good flavor;My husband loves the Starbucks Sumatra K-Cup. Of all the samples of bold coffee for the Keurig he has tried, this is by far his favorite.
697;Just okay;I expected more.  This tastes (to me) very much like the Schweppes in the 12-oz.
698;Mmmmm like hot cocoa powder on a spoon (Dark Chocolate Chunk Cookies);This review is for the Dark Chocolate Chunk Cookies.  These are delicously messy!  At the first bite they reminded me of something.
699;My favorite habanero sauce, period.;Get some of this sauce.  Great on any mexican or spanish food.
700;Great but spicy!;These packets are really great, but they function best if you add vegetables and rice -- they're not so good just by themselves.  By themselves, they are too salty and spicy.
701;YUM! but not craveable;These were tasty..
702;Flavor Fountain Ice Cream Flavoring;Use all flavors to flavor food without calories and sugar.  Tastes great, but you MUST be careful on pricing.
703;Big bottle, slightly above average taste;50.7 ounces for a bottle.
704;This DOES have whole peas in it, but it is a good food.;"Cats do occasionally need a little green in their diet.  Not a whole lot, but their typical ""prey"" in the wile would probably have vegetation in their stomachs when killed and eaten."
705;Fun game, not enough of each color to really play;Got this as a gift for the office. It's nice to get people to take a break from work to see what they get.
706;Amazing!!;Just tried my first taste of the Java Chip Frappe this morning. Java Chip Frappe is a delicious blended iced coffee.
707;Fantastic Ketchup;This is the best tasting ketchup I have ever had.  It is something that I can not do without.
708;It's beef jerky ...;The taste on these are just not right and what I was expecting. I thought it would taste just like the bagged jerky but its not.
709;The Amazing Revolution Infuser Tea Bag!;WOW!<br /><br />The tea has a uniquely wonderful flavor for those who love Lavender and a bit of Bergamot.  You'll have to be the judge if this is the tea for you or not
710;subscribe and save cat food;I love this program with Amazon.  I have many subscriptions for catfood.
711;Convenience = 5 stars, Taste = 2 stars;The world changed for the me the first time I tried a bottle of Starbucks Mocha Frappucino about 10 years ago. The product tasted better than the one you get in store, and the convenience of being able to grab a bottle of a Frappucino and take it to the office was great.
712;Delicious treat;I bought tis at a local heath food store then found it cheaper in bulk on Amazon. My whole family loves all the flavors.
713;You've got to be kidding!;"The ""reviewer from Florida"" was being extremely kind in their review.<br />This gruel is not even fit for farm animals."
714;Perfect for Eating without Expanding!;I love these !<br /> I always crave salty/ crunchy snacks..
715;a Mothers' Day treasure;They were just the correct thing to thank a mother for all she had done for her daughter who is now living 1000's of miles away.<br />A special treat.
716;Great product;Great product compared to others in the same category.  Especially in price.
717;Average cup o' joe;This coffee has an average taste with no major undertones. It has a lighter taste than what I am accustomed to (Starbucks) so I had to use more to acheive the same flavor density.
718;Another HUGE HIT By Nylabone! A Sensational Dog Toy!;Our six year old 92 pound Old English Bulldog and his partner in crime our 6 month old puppy of the same breed - are the certified kings when it comes to destroying even the toughest toys. A long time fan of Nylabone products - because they design toys with the dog in mind and not humans, and have been producing some of the finest, most durable dog toys here in the United States for over 50 years.
719;Not so cluster-y;the quality is good but its more like eating seeds than clusters.  there is no way you can just grab a handful and go.
720;Mine arrived melted;Mine arrived melted completley to the bottom of the box. No care was given in shipping and handling.
721;Not a taste of home;Growing up, I would go to my parents to Wyoming to visit grandparents. My grandmother would make chokecherry jelly, and we thought it was wonderful -- I've been looking for chokecherry jelly ever since.
722;Great alternative to regular sunflowerr seeds;I stumbled on these Jim Beam sunflower seeds at a local convenience store and found them a great alternative to regular sunflower seeds. They were hard to find locally, and began buying through Amazon by the case.
723;love it!;I ordered this when it was on sale for $32 and this product couldn't be beat at this price. Fresh and very tasty.
724;completely ripped off;after opening numerous bags I found that none of the chips had any flavoring on them. completely plain and gross.
725;Ordered and Shipped the Wrong Product....;Ordered this item when it was priced under $20 but was shipped the wrong Muir Glen Item-Plain Tomato Sauce.<br /><br />Tried to return the Plain Tomato Sauce, called Customer Service the same evening of the day the wrong item arrived but was told I could not.
726;Tastes horrible, I would not buy this again, ever.;It smells bland and tastes just plain bad. I regularly eat unsweetened and unflavored rolled oats but was unprepared for how bad these tasted.
727;Fever Tree Lite;Not as much taste and body as the regular Fever Tree tonic when used with gin, but still a marked inprovement to the Schweppes and Canada Dry diet tonics. If you HAVE to have diet then this is the one to get.
728;Healthy and Delicious!;Tried the BBQ Popchips for the first time and loved them so got the value pack to try more flavors. Loved them all except the salt and pepper chips which weren't that great.
729;Amazing!! Spectacular!!;"I got this mix for my daughter for her 16th birthday with the frappe machine and she tells me ""it was the best gift ever, my friends and I love the taste, it is heavenly!"". It's a little pricey but much cheaper than if you bought frappes already made from a coffee shop."
730;Ian's Panko Whole Wheat Crumbs;So glad they made the Panko in whole wheat. Adds more fiber, crunch, taste,lower glycemic and higher nutrients to any food you make with them.
731;Haven't purchased yet, but...;If you want the nutrition info on these bars, go to [..
732;HANDS DOWN FAVORITE INSTANT COFFEE I ALWAYS COME BACK TO;This great instant expresso is truly sensational & in a class by itself !! What makes this so special is not only the fabulous taste, but its powdered form, making it versatile for baking, making truffles, chocolates, and is easily blended in iced coffee beverages. I have tried many other instant expresso coffees and the others are mostly freeze dried, so the taste is not as good & it does not blend well in iced coffees or as versatile for baking or truffle making.
733;good as far as we can tell;after reading the most useful negative review on here, a few times, i can only comment on the things i know.<br /><br />here's what i know.
734;Made both of my dogs sick!!;I gave each of my two dogs one of these bones after I picked them up grocery shopping on Monday evening. By early tuesday morning one of my dogs was already throwing up (first time on my white bedding, of course) and everything after her first bowel movement of the day was pretty much water.
735;Wonderful;Its been a long time since I've enjoyed my morning coffee. This has a great taste and very soothing.
736;Taste like old socks;I thought this coffee was really horrible. Had one cup and will throw the rest away because it can't be returned.
737;if you need a quick lunch or some food that has a longer expiration date;While on the road, I needed some food that could be prepared in a microwave.  I like Indian food and I am a vegetarian so I decided to try this microwave-and-go dish.
738;OMG!;I love this stuff.  I have always bought this at the World Market and they no longer carry this.
739;not what I was expecting;From all that I read on this stuff, I thought it would taste much better than it does.  The problem is, I have nothing to compare it too.
740;Hazelnut (Filberts) in a fragile crescent shaped tea cookie.;Delicate ground hazelnut cookies for a Ladies tea, NOT for children or most men! Appreciated only by sophisticated palates, because they are neither cloyingly sweet or fatty. Set these aside for unexpected guests you'd like to impress.
741;Expensive;I remember buying powdered milk because it was cheaper than regular.<br /><br />I can get about 2 more gallons from my local Safeway for less.
742;Speedy delivery, Great quality;Four days from ordering to delivery, pretty good.  I use the mustard seed in my saffron rice, usually to accompany curry dishes.
743;A Real Blessing;This is a wonderful, versatile product for people who need to keep their carbs low, particularly diabetics who must restrict carbs but still want to eat well. It works in practically any recipe for Bisquick or other baking mix.
744;Sugar, Sugar, and More Sugar.;This used to be my favorite beverage.  Until recently, I drank Ocean Spray Cranapple juice at least twice a day, and on the weekends I guzzled a glass every breakfast, lunch, and dinner.
745;Surprised;Awesome flavor and strength. One of the best.
746;Delish! If you like tangy food, you will like these chips!;These chips are delicious. Lay's are better than any other brand because the hint of vinegar is perfect, not overwhelming to cause you to do the 'alum pucker'.
747;Great bags!;I first tried the Lansinoh bags due to the availability in local stores. They are good but the Honeysuckle seem much thicker and they actually stand up straight when you put them on the counter.
748;Instead of plain water;I work in a dry environment and drink water all day long. I have found many of the Nuun flavors to be very satisfying.
749;yum!;cant live without it. It's definetly a Staple!! in my morning regimen, it tastes great.
750;Vanilla Beans;The product is excellent and so fragrant. I have already used half of what I purchsed by making ice cream and cookies.
751;can't find it;Can't find it at any store. If it don't sell they won't stock it.
752;My favorite tea;I've tried many different brands of rooibos tea. This is the best.
753;Beefaroni rules;If you're not a fan of beefaroni then there is a problem with you, not with Chef Boyardee. This is better than most pastas you can find in fancy restaurants.
754;Diet Cola Syrup;Good stuff. I wish they would run a special on it though.
755;cats loved it;i opened the can and thought..
756;I love these bags already!!!!! -- had to update;I love these bags already.  I have been using them for about a week and am in love with the product.
757;Best of the Flavored Coconut Waters;"I have been enjoying coconut water for over 2 years.  For the most part I love the natural ""regular"" variety, but was able to buy a variety pack through Amazon."
758;Love this tea!;I love drinking this tea, I am able to go through all 6 packs myself over a couple semesters at school. I drink it at least once per day.
759;Honest Review;I was in whole foods in Seattle Washington and saw this gumbo for sale. Being a Louisiana native, I know what good Gumbo tastes like.
760;Overpriced and tough;Sadly, I purchased this believing all the hype in the reviews. Must be employees of the manufacturer or they own one of those industrial strength stand mixers.
761;Kids Like The Shape!;A fun pasta to help motivate the kids to eat a minimal fat/salt food. The ingredients list wheat flour.
762;Delicious and a Great, Satisfying Snack.;"This snack bar is incredibly delicious. It satisfies my sweet tooth and my late afternoon ""need"" for a quick something with protein and fiber to keep me going until dinner."
763;The only cat food my cat eats and loves;My picky eater cat is getting older and rejects plenty of other cat foods. She loves this one and has less shedding because of the ingredients in this food.
764;Just like the old days.;Received Cruet and dressing mix. I loved this dressing as a child and wanted to find the cruet that came with it.
765;sugary residue in bottom of can;My order of these cans arrived in mint condition.  The issue I have with La Lechera sweetened condensed milk is that there is crunchy sugar that settles in the can.
766;Great Cola Taste;"The tase of this cola is better than the ""REAL"" cola.  I drink 1/3 of a liter of this cola and then I switch to a non-caffine cola of which I drink 2/3 of a liter daily."
767;Top-Quality Tea;I'm a Chinese living in the US. I bought this product about a month before I went back to China for a vacation.
768;an upgraded packaged skillet dinner;Convenience is not to be dismissed as a small consideration for many families today. This was an item I wanted to try on my own, especially my pasta-heads, those connoisseurs of all things cheesy, quick and calories be banned.
769;Great chocolate;These chocolate discs are very silky and melt well. The ingredient list is short and they have real vanilla.
770;Good addition to my dog's already solid food.;Currently, we feed our older Collie the Kirkland brand dog food for senior dogs.  We chose that food after doing online research and the fact that it included glucosamine.
771;One of the better Aero Garden Kits;One of the easiest of the kits to grow. The herb kits are also good.
772;Great Soda! Need Cheaper Shipping options!;Been a Dry Soda fan for a while now and it is one of the better non-alcoholic drinks available.  The flavors are subtle and sophisticated.
773;New Maxwell House;"Just a note to remind folks that Maxwell House has changed it's blend and if you order you will probably get the ""new"" MH, which is a stronger ""coffee house"" blend.  Not the fault of Amazon."
774;Positively Delish!;I tried these for the first time the other day, and they are so tasty! The crunch is perfectly satisfying, and the BBQ flavor is quite good. I love that they are good for me, and not full of junky ingredients.
775;Mexican Vanilla;I always use Mexican Vanilla in all of my baking..
776;The Minestrone is the only Sprout meal we like;My son eats it up.  I like it because it smells like normal soup.
777;Chili Lime Flavor - Review;In general, I love Popchips.  (BBQ are my absolute favs.
778;Pretty much what I expected;This is a fairly basic cereal with a bit of chocolate in the middle.  It's good and chrunchy, but you don't want to leave it in the milk too long.
779;Best waffles!!;This makes THE best waffles! I recognized the brand from the waffles made at hotels. Now I have restaurant style waffles at home.
780;Hirsch Classic Candy;YUM..
781;Love it!;This baby food maker is awesome.  It steams the food and then purees it.
782;AMAZIING!!!!;I primarily use these to prevent a hang over. Since your body gets depleted of most of the vitamins that are in this it gives you an extra BOOST of these vitamins right before I go out for a night of drinking.
783;Cardboard *blah*, not refundable;I was really looking forward to a salty savory crunchy break from the usual sweet protein shakes and  protein bars.  This one was lousy.
784;Even my husband says it tastes good;My husband said this Happy Baby flavor is really good.  I love the mixture of fruit and veggie.
785;WONDRFUL TASTING TEA;The flavor here screams tropical..
786;Healthy cats and kittens!;My cats were having so many digestive issues with other dry cat food. Let's just say the kitty litter was a lot messier than I wanted to clean up.
787;Delicious and very refreshing;After hearing all the hype about coconut water, I was eager to try it out for myself.  I bought 2 different brands that I found at Whole Foods (one of those being this brand) to try out before I committed to a 12-pack purchase.
788;A long time staple in our house;"We have been through just about every brand of dog food offered by our local market and <a href=""http://www.amazon."
789;Pricey, Sweet, Colored Water;Pricey:  About $12.56 per gallon with Amazon'z 15% discount and free shipping or $14.
790;Great Coffee!;We recently purchased this coffee and it was great! Good flavor, not too strong and not too weak with just the right amount of vanilla flavoring. Bonus that its organic too.
791;The first tea I really like;"I've drank tea over the years, but had never enjoyed it.  A friend handed me a cup of <a href=""http://www."
792;GOOD, BUT THESE AREN'T CARAMELS;"I was disappointed that these are not caramels- the description should read "" caramel-flavored hard candies"" as that is what  these are.<br /><br />However, I was not disappointed in the taste- these are made of largely natural ingredients, and they taste like it."
793;It tastes like cherries...;I hate the taste of honey..
794;Fizzy Juice;An nice change from cola, this has a definite cherry flavor but it is not too sweet.  Sort of a carbonated Juicy Juice.
795;Good oats at twice the cost of Walmart rolled oats;I eat oatmeal for breakfast every day.  Nutritionally the Old Wessex brand is identical to Walmart's Great Value Old Fashioned Rolled Oats.
796;On the Light Side of Medium Blend Coffees.  Smooth with No Aftertaste.  Typical Breakfast Blend.;If you like a lighter coffee blend, then this one is a good choice.  It is a breakfast blend, so the flavor will not compete with your food.
797;Love The Beast but this shipping is too high!;I believe the hotter the better..
798;A GREAT PRODUCT!;We've used compact fluorescent bulbs all over the house for years.  They save money on the electric bill, and they save time.
799;Five Paw Salute !!;"My selection, which contained 12 cans each of Chicken Pot Pie and Sesame Chicken, arrived quickly, and I looked forward to seeing how my kitties would like it.<br /><br />I liked the fact that:<br /><br />(1) Petite Cuisine has NO Wheat Gluten,<br /><br />and<br /><br />(2) it's made from ""Human Grade"" ingredients -- which means even I can eat it if I really wanted to -- and truth be told -- I DID sample a bit from each of those 2 selections -- and both selections tasted better than anything I have tasted when I buy a Brand Name can of canned chicken for myself."
800;Strange flavor..;"We like the vanilla and chocolate and usually like strawberry milk we purchase at the supermarket but this had too strange a flavor. I find Organic Valley's ""competitor"" on Amazon has a little better flavors in their brand."
801;Great flavored coffee;Wolfgang Puck coffees are great and the Creme Caramel is one of my favorites. I would recommend this coffee for people who like a mild flavor.
802;WORKS WELL IN DELONGHi EC155;Bought these Lavazza Gran Crema Espresso Pods after purchasing a Delonghi EC155 Espresso Machine. This was my first dabble in homemade Espresso and I figured the pods would be easier to start with.
803;Flushed, Diarrhea from Hell, throbbing stomach, lips numb;These gummies are something that we do not want the radical islam terroist to get there hands on. From what I know now, there are no secrets that would be worth keeping, if they threatned to make me eat the gummies.
804;Not good;I grew up on Kraft Mac N Cheese in the blue box, and still love it.  My kids love it too.
805;Decieving;I was excited to try these given that they have no gluten and no dairy and no soy.  However, they are painfully crunchy, and I seem to get a headache every time I eat one.
806;Disgusting;This is NOT coffee!<br />It was also not what I expected.<br />No where in the description does it say that it contains hydrogenated oils!<br />I brewed one cup - it looked and smelled like dirty dish water.
807;I wanna go to the Madhouse;These might possibly be the best chips ever.<br /><br />The bad news is that we can't keep them in the house.
808;Better than Kraft;Our daughter is a Mac n Cheese lover.  She loves these though even though they are not elbow shaped.
809;Not bad, but not good either;When I got my Keurig I fell in love. I bought a bunch of different sample packs and two boxes of the grove square hot cocoa.
810;Coconut Oil;I have done a ton of research to find an Organic substitute for butter and margarine. I do not use either to cook at home with.
811;Awesome;I can't find these anywhere on the west coast.  They are my favorite flavor and I am so glad that I can have them again.
812;Great tasting syrup;This is a very good spread for toast or bread.  There's nothing like it in the US and I was very happy to find this source for Lyle's through Amazon.
813;very weak;I bought this product as I desired a decaffinated English Breakfast tea. I have found that unless it is brewed twice or a lot of tea leaves are used, it is a very weak tea.
814;Never thought I'd be buying groceries from Amazon.com;My store stopped stocking this rice for some reason.  It is a far superior blend than anything else I've tried and so I Googled it and was surprised to find it here.
815;A delicious way to sneak some extra fiber into your day.;This was a nice cookie. The cookies are individually packaged so that you can easily tuck them into a lunchbag or a purse, and the packaging really does hold up well.
816;So tasty and healthy too;My 16 month old has been enjoying these for the past few months and she loves them!  I've tasted them myself and they're very yummy.  I like that it's a bit different than the usual applesauce.
817;Rich Colombian Nutty Flavor;Camano Island Coffee Roasters corrected the packaging problem, so my coffee arrived with a good aroma and oils on the bean. Colombian coffee is typically a bright slightly-nutty brew.
818;Sprayed orange grease all over the inside of the microwave;The pop-up bowl sounds like a great idea, but evidently they rushed it to market before all the bugs were out.<br /><br />The first bag I cooked was fine, except the instructions for opening the bag are far from clear, and even after you figure out how to do it it's a lot of trouble and makes a big mess.
819;THE BEST YET!;Faschi walnut butter is just walnuts, nothing else at all, pure walnutty taste and texture, it is fabulous! Especially good on slices of apple. There are no added oils which is a blessing
820;Refined delicious and good for so many things;They came well pack ..
821;Flimsy!;I should have returned this since it is very flimsy - the pieces do not connect well and the whole unit keeps falling over..
822;love the product, love the price;Love the product, love the price.  As another reviewer said, there are no basic instructions on the package.
823;odd flavor;I really did not like this tea. i general love chamomile tea and drink a lot of different brands  but this one has a strong honey flavor that totally overpowers chamomile.
824;Salty, Not Hot at all as expected;I am so disapointed with this buy..
825;Good product, but huge dent in 1 of 6 cans;I have purchased this item in a larger can before and it is great mango pulp for cooking, desserts, etc.<br /><br />One of the six cans had a huge dent and it would have been obvious before pack was placed in shipping box.
826;Yummy!!;The snacks themselves are yummy! My favorite was the apple and cinnamon, makes me remember when I would cut apples in half put butter in cinnamon in them and roast them over a fire! The snacks are good and the amount in each package are perfect, not to much and not to little. The only reason I gave it four stars is because I really wish the bags were resealable and they are not.
827;Will cause to fail drug test!!;Drinking this will give a positive on a drug test. Beware! A friend from Chili gave me some, but I found out that this is not for people who have to do drug tests.
828;Miracle in a jar;I am in love with this product. It is awesome.
829;WASH IT FIRST!;"I buy this in 14-oz bags at the supermarket.  Unlike most quinoa, the package I buy says ""No rinsing needed,"" and until recently they were right."
830;Great if you don't use too much;I like the flavor of this product and it's a great way to eat salt without eating too much of it. The one caveat here is that you don't pour extra salt on to compensate for the lower strength of the flavor.
831;Terrific Treats;Great treats!  My Goldendoodle loves them.  She loves all of the flavors, expecially the peanut butter.
832;Inspired Cuisine is better.;I found out that the Nestle European Style Mousse mix (the leading brand in the U.S.
833;Great Chip!;With Kettle Chips, you really have to be careful.  Some of their flavors are nauseating.
834;Too Salty;This is not what I expected. I weaned myself off extremely salty foods years ago.
835;Order arrived promptly filled with EMPTY k-cups;Was pleased with the packaging and prompt delivery however EVERY SINGLE PACKAGE WAS EMPTY.  No coffee inside.
836;Great price fast delivery. I am now a repeat customer!;When I first ordered on line I thought it was unusual to buy my coffee pods off the Internet. Now I am about to order for the third time.
837;Very SPICY...;THESE LITTLE COOKIES ARE VERY SPICY.<br /><br />SO IF YOU LIKE VERY SPICY THINGS YOU WILL LOVE THESE.
838;Nana Banana - a delicious gluten-free treat for kids or adults!;"Let me preface this review by saying that in the gluten-free world, baked goods tend to be a bit on the crumbly side because they are missing the ""glue"" (gluten) that holds them together.  Taking this into consideration, Nana's gluten free cookie bars are one of the tastiest gluten-free treats and one of the only brands sweetened with fruit juice instead of sugar."
839;Pleasantly surprised!;Expecting just a quick cup of coffee with limited flavor I was impressed with the quality of these K-cups.  Great flavor, bold and if you like your coffee strong, you will not be disappointed.
840;Yum;One of the best ramen I've tried, spicy and it comes with a seaweed packet unlike many of the ramen you find in grocery stores.  Very high in sodium, I dump the broth after eating the noodles and veggies.
841;great product, but heads up.....;Great product, but did not puree upon completion of first cooking cycle..
842;My cat meows at me every morning;for this food! Sam loves this stuff and it's not as stinky as cheaper brands of canned catfood. I'm going to order other flavors for him to try.
843;This stuff is excellent!;I just recently purchased this product, so I could get the energy to get off my butt and hit the gym. This definitely helped me do that, and since I count calories, this product also have a definite plus.
844;Good Value;I enjoy the decaf coffee every morning.  It has good flavor and it's easy to make in the Keurig Brewer.
845;Works great in morning smoothies!;I bought a 16-ounce bag of Bob's Red Mill Organic Golden Flaxseed Meal a few months ago and have been using it ever since. I have heard that you shouldn't keep it that long once you open it, but I haven't noticed any problems.
846;Bold, fresh flavor;On one hand, the unique unsealed design means you won't be keeping these in your K-cup holders or carousels.<br /><br />If you don't mind keeping these in a ziplock bag separate from your other cups and you don't mind the extremely strong scent when you open the bag, you will be treated to a bold flavor that is similar to Coffee People's Black Tiger but smoother.
847;Gum for my soldier overseas from Amazon.com;I belong to Soldiers' Angels, a non profit organization that adopts soldiers for the duration of their deployment overseas.  My adopted soldier requested Ice Breakers Ice Cubes Sugar Free Raspberry gum.
848;Rancid product;I've opened 4 of the 8 packages of Greenies, one was rancid.  My cat started vomiting after eating the Salmon Greenies.
849;I can eat it with a spoon;This is fantastic. If it's really 85% less calorie and fat, I will eat it with a spoon with no reservations.
850;Tea;I have been ordering Bigelow decaf Lemon Lift on-line for a couple of years now. Local stores don't carry it, so it is a good deal for me.
851;My dog loves these Zukes!;I got these treats because we needed chewy treats that our soft-coated wheaten terrier puppy could eat quickly during training. We had a lot of the cookie type treats earlier but it took too long for him to break apart the dry treats and lick up the crumbs.
852;Delicious, low calorie and healthy snack. Good price too!;I purchased these based on others recommendations. The rice cakes are delicious.
853;Not as Peachy as the Black Tea;If you like peach teas, this is not the one for you.  The peach flavor is lost and it tastes more like an Oolong tea.
854;My Favorite Snack;Bought one stick of this at a health food store and loved it!  I often crave a jerky like food.  This completely satisfied my craving.
855;Good Stuff;Simple..
856;"""Better than meat!"" says the carnivore.";I am a card-carrying carnivore.  Having said that, I am also the Laziest Man This Side of a Lebowski.
857;Good Buy;This is a good price for starbucks K- cups.  Tired of paying lots more in the grocery store and at Staples.
858;After 23 yrs' hot flashes, some relief!;Hot flashes, one per hour, 24/7, since complete hysterectomy in 1988.  Breast cancer in 1998, so no more hormones.
859;ok but;Flavor is ok but product was melted by the time it was delivered. It was messy to eat crumbling all over.
860;Mr.;"<a href=""http://www.amazon."
861;YUM;This is a great multi-use sauce.  Great for using as a baste when grilling - fish, chicken, shrimp, pork, etc.
862;Greenies Senior;My dog always liked greenies.  Since she is now 13 years old this product is ideal for her.
863;They are okay;I was first introduced these at my yoga studio,of course everyones gona love them after you sweat all your salt out.I then bought them at whole foods and now trader joes are selling them.
864;Very Convenient;Love Jack Links, so I was thrilled to see these easy to grab individually wrapped packages on Amazon with the Subscribe and Save option.  I have a son in college so I have them sent to him.
865;great toddler snack;I have been buying these for about a year now for my 2 boys now 2 and 4yo.  These are a great on the go snack that a mom can feel good about serving up.
866;Sooooo GOOD;If I want to make Bear Creek Soups I put them in the crock pot to cook on low for 8 hours and get wonderful results.  For the Chili I add 1 can of green chili and diced tomato and a can of tomato paste with a couple of soup can's of water, I think I used 4.
867;Pricey;This product is available at 89c at Whole with a 10% case discount and you are charging over $1.30.
868;To Die For Chocolate Sauce!!!;This stuff is awesome and I wll definitely buy it again.  Great on ice cream or anything else.
869;Really good but too expensive;I have been considering these for a while but didn't want to pay shipping charges so when I found them locally I decided to give them a try.  Made manhattans and froo froo frozen drinks with them at a party last night and nobody particularly raved.
870;Great, All-Natural Dog Treat;This is a terrific treat. My dog loves them.
871;Delicious! but expensive.;Per package of 3<br />9fat<br />5 sat fat<br />20g carbs<br />2 fiber<br />14g sugar<br />1g protein<br />with organic dark chocolate, evaporated can juice, organic cocoa butter, organic soy then the rest gets a bit heavier with sugar, corn syrup, milk..
872;Good flavor;Although this vanilla powder is not as powerful flavor-wise as I'd expected, I can't complain. It's great for those times when extract isn't practical.
873;Nice mild coffee that still delivers a morning kick...;My days of enjoying bold, dark coffee times have long past. Maybe it's age, or maybe it was my time in the navy when midwatch coffee was always black and bitter, and the only thing that changed when the daywatch came around was a freshening of the grounds.
874;Coffee Lovers, welcome!;If you love coffee italian style,strong and stout, you will love this chocolate candy. It's not for everyone.
875;Natural Balance Synergy;I purchase this food for my two pugs and it not only keeps them healty and active, but they are lean as well.  If you know anything about pugs, they tend to be on the heavy side.
876;Try Cat-Sip Real Milk;I bought this one time when PetSmart was out of Cat-Sip Real Milk. My cats wouldn't even try it.
877;Slowest shipping ever!;Great candy, fresh, as expected.  But seller has a VERY long shipping window and uses every day of it.
878;LOVE NECTA SWEET SUGAR SUBSTITUTE TABLETS!!;I HAVE BEEN USING THIS PRODUCT FOR OVER 30 YEARS.  I WAS THRILLED TO FIND IT ON<br />AMAZON.
879;Easy to use, and it makes smooth and creamy milk!;I do have to say that I have a vitamix, too.  So, I am able to blend my almonds/coconut really well before pouring it into the nut milk bag.
880;Excellent Decafe Terrible Amizon Price;Excellent bold decaf which you can buy direct from Green Mountain for $.46 each (6 boxes of 24 cups no shipping) v.
881;I love these things!;I wish they weren't so addicting, I bought the box and had it gone in a week. Way too addicting but they are delicious none the less.
882;Eh....;I didn't care so much for these crackers.  I know that they are supposed to be better for me, but I suppose I'm a die hard Cheese It fan.
883;Some Of The Best Stuff I've Ever Put In My Mouth!!;This oil is unbelievable!  I researched truffle oil for about a month and ended up ordering this stuff.  What a great choice!<br /><br />It's excellent on ANYTHING!  And extremely affordable.
884;Perfect for Cockers!;My father could no longer take care of his beloved 6 year old Cocker Spaniel, so I decided to take her into my family. When I brought her to NYC she had ear and eye discharge.
885;reviewing chocolate;"""Great chocolate with cherries. Always tasted fresh, packaging was nice, wrapped for safety."
886;A True Delight;After fighting every morning over our lone coffee maker (and not wanting to invest in a K-cup machine), I decided to try this instant coffee for my caffeine-free husband.  He no longer cheats on his doctor's orders.
887;Yay, less plastic! Boo, weak coffee!;These smell FANTASTIC! Too bad the coffee is weak. When the machine brews, the last 70% of the stream is hot water.
888;Love these cookies from my childhood but they were a bit stale;I love these cookies from my childhood but the ones I got were a bit too stale. They were normally stale and that was not a bother but these seemed too stale.
889;Tasty;This is my first experience with Kona and I find it very flavorful.<br /><br />Perhaps I'll examine more expensive types of Kona in the future, but right now this is priced right and delivers a good cup of joe.
890;Makes life so much easier!;Whenever I read recipes for baby food, the amount of work that goes into them--chopping, cooking, blending, pureeing, etc.--seems really daunting.
891;AMAZING;This is the first flavor I have tried, and it's simply amazing.  I picked one up from my local Wal-Mart (they carry four flavors at my local store), and I have yet to try the other three.
892;"A big hit with the ""kids""";I just ordered these after my dogs' favorite chews were discontinued by the manufacturer. They love these things! Both are about 40-45 pounds and pretty strong chewers, and these last them at least a few minutes (which is pretty good for them!).
893;Great transaction! Great Coffee!;I love the coffee and I love the transaction. Fast and easy.
894;Best tea ever!;It's hard to find loose leaf tea around here so I ordered it and am well pleased. This is tea like Mom used to make, full of flavor but light and satisfying on those hot summer days as iced tea, and the same on those cold winter days as hot tea.
895;"Not ""everlasting""";I picked up several bento balls and large treat balls with these treats. I have a: one year old half Timber Wolf, half German Shepherd
896;nice organic white;This is a very nice organic white miso from Japan, very mellow, just right balance of taste and flavors.  Goes well in seaweed soups.
897;Best jerky size/brand/flavor you can get;I have personally been on a mission to find my favorite jerky for a few years now.  This is by far my favorite jerky - just a little spicy, great texture, perfect size for a snack, and pretty healthy besides sodium.
898;Grest tea;The tea taste great and also smells wonderful. The tea is very fresh.
899;My Yorkie's Favorite!;As a proud pet parent of a six-pound Yorkie, I try to provide her with the healthiest possible food and treats - preferably products that are made in the United States, given the recent issues with pet food and toys made in China and other countries.<br /><br />The little one LOVES these Z-Bones (Apple Crisp is her favorite, though she also enjoys the Cherry flavor) and they're the perfect size for her to chew on.
900;Smooth dark roast;Smooth, slightly nutty tasting medium dark roast mix at a very reasonable price. Great for every morning or as an early afternoon pick-me-up.
901;Cherry juice;This brand is not as good as another brand I tried.  It's not as concentrated and doesn't have that right cherry flavor.
902;Great no caffine tea...but;It is difficult to find. I do not know how many boxes you get from Amazon, but the price is over 100.
903;Doesn't go that far...;I bought this hoping to cut down on all the 1/2 gallon cardboard garbage from Rice Dream that I buy in the grocery store.  I found, to get a palatable flavor, each 21.
904;Cheryl;I think this has a VERY STRANGE SMELL!!  Yuck---I can't imagine putting it in my food or cooking with it.  I use it on my skin & everytime I do I am wondering if something is wrong with it.
905;Tastes very good!!!;This tea is very good.  I discovered it while visiting in California.
906;Yum!;They keep me full for about 2 1/2 - 3 hours. Not bad for one little bar.
907;Great coffee!!;I've never been a SANKA or instant coffee fan but Starbucks is the BEST instant coffee!!!  I buy both the regular and decaf.  I'll never drink that 'hotel' coffe when we travel again.
908;Outstanding Flavor - Highly Recommended;"These David's Signature Beyond Gourmet ""Pomegranate"" jelly beans are spot on in flavor and are just fantastic tasting. This flavor is from David Klein, the creator of the famous ""Jelly Belly"" jelly beans, so I was thrilled to be offered this in <a href=""http://www."
909;Loved the quaker;I received a complimentary sample from Influenster to try the quaker cookie.  It was soft and amazingly delicious.
910;Royal Canin Intense Hairball...is the best!;I had learned about Royal Canin's Intense Hairball formula (for cats) last year, from a friend of a friend.  I finally started using it about 6-months ago and I was amazed and elated at how well it works.
911;Like underripe grapes.;This beverage tastes distinctly like the underripe green grapes we used to eat from the vine in my aunt's yard.  Tart, sweet, sour, and refreshing.
912;Very deep flavor;The leaves are miniscule, so you'll need a mesh steeper. Davidson's have  improved their packaging and now use a resealable bag.
913;Addictive, salty treat;A bit salty this bacon flavored mayonnaise tastes so good on turkey or chicken sandwiches. It is also good in potato salad.
914;Hasbrowns;These are great for when you just want a few hashbrowns or want a lot, either way you are covered. Good buy.
915;CET VeggieDent Dental Chews;The dogs love these things.  They are too big for my yorkies 6 & 8 lbs so I have to cut them in half.
916;Pretty good coffee;"On my search for the ""perfect"" coffee, this one comes pretty close. It's not bitter even when made very strong."
917;Positively Perfect Primula Flowering Tea;Have tasted only one out of 12 teas, but it was wonderful--- green tea jsmine lotus blossom. Great flavor, light and delicate but with lots of flavor.
918;The Worst K-Kup of all so far;With a variety pack I received about 7 of these k-cups. I tried the first one and it was very bitter.
919;Happily Addicting!;I purchased this to go make with my Bialetti Espresso pot. It is so smooth and rich, holds up extremely well to steamed milk.
920;happy foster mom;
921;Love;A little over a year and a half ago I became obsessed with tea.  I have tried every organic (and even some of the well-reputed non-organic brands) tea that I've been able to obtain.
922;Terrific tasting lollipops!!;These are absolutely the most delicious lollipops ever!  We originally tasted them as a fund-raiser for the American Heart Foundation in Atlanta, GA.  As soon as we got home, I searched for them on the internet, found them here, and ever since, have been handing them to our family and friends.
923;too rich for my dog, gave her black poo;I found this food to be too rich for my 25 lb cockapoo.  It gave her really black tarry poop which im guessing is because the food is high in Iron.
924;Best green tea!;I tried all sorts of different green tea.  I usually drink 4-5 cups a day.
925;Best Quaker Oatmeal Variety;This is a great variety.  Nuts and fruit go very well in the oatmeal.
926;Exactly what I needed;I had been searching my local stores for this product since I moved here 5 years ago.  No luck, even in the organic stores, unless I wanted to spend an arm and a leg.
927;Best Decal I've had that's water processed;Finally a decaf coffee that not only tastes like a good coffee house coffee, but is also water processed.<br /><br />We've been using this for almost a year now with the subscribe and save.
928;Great product and good price;These little buggers are tough to find so I was happy to get a big pack at a good price online.  My daughter is content with these as a reward for doing something well and at 2 calories a piece, not all that unhealthy.
929;Couldn't be easier!;I don't know that I'm saving much in terms of buying at the store. If so, it's just a few cents a can.
930;Great taste!;I like this so much that I use it in most of the foods that need a pork flavor. I have even used it in home made baked beans.
931;Good! Very tasty!;These are nice, big & juicy. Their flavor & texture are good.
932;Tasted great!;Good-quality chocolate (better than Hershey's, more like Lindt or other European chocolates).  Arrived quickly, were packed well and were not melted or broken.
933;TERIYAKI JERKY;Used with ground deer meat. I made six pounds and followed their directions.
934;LOVE AMAZON;This creamer is the BEST!! and Amazon prices are SUPER!!! It runs about .50-.
935;So strong, so good;"I didn't think I was a Green Mountain Coffee Roasters fan - I usually think their coffee is mediocre, at best - but this is excellent.  I make one cup per ""small"" Keurig serving - and it's almost an espresso."
936;Love these Cherries;What can I say they are delicious, good for you and convenient to eat while on the go or whatever. I love Klein's dried cherries.
937;Avoid this one;Buying tea online is a risky proposition. I've enjoyed Jasmine teas for years--just not this one.
938;great;I'm one of the few ones that actually like drinking water and do it not just for the health benefits but it's actually my drink of choice.  I buy all different waters and this one is perfect.
939;The Best Cookie I've Had (Oh, and it's Gluten-Free!);This product is a celiac's dream!  Nana's no gluten cookies have by far the most consistent texture of any gluten free cookies that I have tried (including my own homemade).  They are hardly distinguishable from a wheat-based cookie.
940;Consistent, Quick, Healthy breakfast choice.;I have to admit, when I saw this available on vine I thought it may be a new twist on a classic product but it's not. It's the same oatmeal that we have had for many years.
941;Average chocolate, strong fillings;"These are definitely ""mid-range"" chocolates, not quite as good as Godiva or See's. If you're used to low-end chocolates like Fannie May or Russell Stover, you'll probably find these to be very good."
942;Stale;I am an avid consumer of Jack Links Beef Steak Nuggets.  This batch is stale, dry and almost tasteless.
943;advertisement confusion;"anything from the amish clan is going to be good ""eatin"" but the advertisement stated these noodles were wide and they are hardly wide!  at best, maybe medium.  i always get their kluski noodle and these wide ones are about the same size."
944;Great cup of coffee;Van Houtte Creme Brulee is a very great tasting smooth coffee. I enjoy it very much.
945;The best;If you like black tea, this is the best. A deep rich flavor, outrageously wonderful with milk.
946;BEST CEREAL EVER;No question about it, Basic 4 delivers the yummies! Packing corn and bran flakes as well as multitude of nuts and berries and even puffed rice. It's a party in your mouth.
947;Great product, but trust your vet not the hype;I have two cats, one 6 and one 2 years old. Both are indoor cats in excellent health.
948;Not a latte;Be sure when you order this product that you do not want the latte. It was my first order with the K-Cups and I ordered the wrong thing.
949;Outstanding Seller;We love having fun with the Gold Flakes.  Guests chuckle and ohh and ahh over having gold shaken into their cocktals.
950;Good for YOU and Good for Children and FUN to EAT plus some NEAT-O TRICKS & TIPS!;Once again Pepperidge Farms has created a wholesome snack that is not only good for you but also good for children too
951;Pros and cons...;Pros: Very low-calorie
952;Organic formula that's great for my kids!;Earth's Best Infant Formula is easily prepared, organic, and my kid drinks it.  I like the formula because it's organic and has DHA and ARA included so I know my kid is getting the nutrients he needs.
953;Beef Jerky Goes Bad?;What a rip off.  We opened the bag and a day later there was wispy white mold on it.
954;Quick ship!;Great tea, but everyone knows that as Yogi teas are available in grocery stores across the country. I got a great deal on 6 boxes though, and for me that's not a whole lot to buy at once.
955;The worst snap-lock reseal ever made?;I feed Hills Science diet to my pet because I love him and the vet tells me I should. But in all honesty, this product has what is quite certainly the worst snap-lock reseal that I have ever encountered.
956;Beware these nuts! Bitter Taste Lasts For Days!;I thought this sounded like a great deal - I love pine nuts and the price was right.  Unfortunately, these pine nuts are imported from China and have caused me to have a lasting bitter taste in my mouth.
957;This stuff is awesome;I travel a good deal and heading to the east coast from California is always a bit of a challenge the first day with customers.  Being a night owl I usually end up getting four or maybe five hours of sleep.
958;Fine Powder, Easy to Mix;I prefer this hemp powder over the Living Harvest brand.  The Navitas hemp protein powder is a much finer grind, almost a powder, which makes it much easier to blend into drinks and smoothies.
959;Allergic grandson loves them;My 4 year old grandson who has serious food allergies loves these crackers so much that he regards them as a special treat, and he can gobble down a whole box at one sitting. Normally, he eats very little, but give him these crackers, fruit, and cheese and he is a happy boy.
960;Dependable, top of the line product.;Newman products have been used in our home for years. After researching Newman's Adult Dog food I felt confident in giving the food to our two cocapoo's.
961;Kona Blend;This coffee is very smooth.  I enjoy it very much and will continue to purchase.
962;Allison R;I have used other gluten free bread mixes and found this one to be excellent.  It holds together without crumbling and has a good flavor.
963;Pretty good;Aroma was awesome. As far as the taste goes, I definitely got the berry note.
964;coffee;I have tried this a couple of times now since I have enough to enjoy over and over, but I have to say overall it is just okay for me. The coffee flavor is not present and the peppermint is very weak in taste.
965;Tasty Coffee;I get the sense that this is the Folgers of Germany. Note that Jacobs Kronung Decaf is Made in Germany by Kraft Foods Germany.
966;SNAPEA CRISPS;Absolutely Love this Product!!!!!!! They become addictive!!!!!<br />Very difficult to find in stores though..
967;not gluten free;"Yes, the tortillas were tasty, but the product is cross-contaminated with gluten.  The labeling is very deceiving!  It says: ""corn, a gluten free food"" on the label, but they blew it by using dirty equipment."
968;Stash makes good tea;I really enjoy tea and drink two or three 16 ounce cups a day, especially when it's cold outside. I used to drink mostly Twinings and Bigelow because hey, that's what they had at the supermarket.
969;Not impressed;I tried the Red Rain Energy Shot (Berry Flavored) at work as I was looking for a pickup one morning when I had not gotten much sleep.  Having never tried any of the little energy shots, I was unsure what to expect beyond assuming that I would become more alert.
970;Good, but Dark & Sweet version is so much better!;Royal Brand makes the best pudding..
971;Most economic package;I love Genmaicha but don't have the time to brew loose tea. Choice Organic gives me the tea that I love with the convenience of tea bags at a great price.
972;Disappointed;I just made myself a cup of San Francisco Bay Coffee, Rainforest Blend and am very disappointed in the lack of flavor.  I had previously ordered from this company a different flavor and was pleased with that roast which had a strong distinctive flavor.
973;BEST EVER;Best energy drink ever. Great for giving long lasting energy through the day.
974;Perfect;This is a great product.  We have a large mixed breed dog who needs help with her joints.
975;Yum Yum;In a word, yummy! Although I'm not exactly obsessed with nutrition, I am somewhat of a health nut and am concerned about proper nutrition and its role in energy, fitness, longevity, appearance, stress management, and overall health, especially for my family. I've been known to scour the shelves of grocery stores and other retail establishments for just the perfect bar, the kind that's tasty, chocked full with nutrients, and affordable.
976;Good heat and good flavor;This sauce has a good delicately balanced flavor, I can understand why it is a favorite sauce among it's fans.  The flavor is balanced with no one particular one ingredient taking over.
977;Kikkoman Wakame Soup;I really like this soup. It's simple to make, just add boiling water, give it a stir, and let it sit for a few minutes.
978;From a tea-lover: MUST TRY;As a foodie, I'm also a bit of a snob about teas, generally preferring organic, muslin-bagged or loose teas. That said, this Stash Chanakara Tea sampler, on first try, immediately became my favourite tea purchase, and I promptly ordered this excellent bulk value offered by Amazon, soon after trying each of the seven teas included in the box.
979;Love this product;"Just be forewarned it is a bit ""moist.""  Have plenty of papertowels/napkins around when eating it."
980;Wonderful!;This soup mix is quick and easy with the flexibility to use as reccemmended or add any leftover veggies, rice or noodles for a heftier soup. As soon as someone in the house starts to come down with a cold, I make this up.
981;A new office favorite;This coffee is amazing. It's strong and bold without that burnt taste that sometimes comes along with bolder roasts.
982;Fructose;This product is what all should be using instead of the refined sugar that is everywhere. It's sweeter, you use less and it's easy to store and keep.
983;Baconless Flavoring Powder;What a disappointment! First, this product should not have the name Bacon Salt. If you are familiar with the infused salts made for gourmet cooking with flavors such as thyme or rosemary, you will notice that this is a flavoring powder and not a salt at all.
984;Best Pate ever ....;Alexian pate is so smooth, delicate and creamy..
985;wonderful;These taste wonderful. And they are at an amazing price, compared to what I can get them for at my local walmart.
986;Powdered peanut butter;I love this product.  It tastes just like peanut butter.
987;Misleading Photo;I thought we were getting the enormous bundle for the price I paid, which I thought was a deal. Instead it turned out to be a small pack of the twists.
988;Natural Vitality/ Natural Calm;Natural Vitality/Natural Calm is eas to take, easy and effective on the system . I am very satisfied with the product and will most definitely continue to use this product.
989;Great Orange Chocolate!;I bought the product for my wife.  She had eaten some before and it was exactly what I ordered.
990;Bad aftertaste;I didn't realize before I purchased this that it has sucralose in it. I really dislike the aftertaste, so much that I can't use the rest.
991;Hot and good;If you like really hot horseradish as I do this is the place to buy it.  I searched long and hard to find a really good horseradish and this is the only one I buy now.
992;Very Disappointed!!;Purchased $28 worth of Hostess Lemon Fruit Pies from this company and they all expired 3 days after they arrived.  You may want to ask for the expiration date of the products you purchase from this company.
993;Great  Buy;Exactly what I ordered. Product was just as if I had bought it in the store, only a way better deal.
994;Solid Gentle Flavor;"I prefer ""Earl Grey"" tea, so I rarely drink a ""Chai"" tea.  Higgins & Burke has produced a very nice quality Chai product."
995;One of my favorite jerky's;This is one of my favorite jerkys.  I like the Hickory best of all.
996;Instant Coffee????;I am a coffee drinker who considered instant coffee flavored water rather than coffee.  Recently I was in a Costco where samples of the Starbucks instant coffee being served.
997;Very unique!;"I ordered this for my fiance who labled this soda ""the best he's ever had!"".  It was very unique--a rootbeer/cream soda taste."
998;box too large;I ordered this for my office as well. It was too large and overwhelming for the space I had planned to place it.
999;Great taste!;This tastes a lot better then the majority of sugar free powdered drinks. It has low carbs and a good amount of protein.
1000;I'm addicted to these things!;I just love these delicious little fish, and my grandchildren are very disappointed if I don't have some available when they come over. Buying these tasty treats in large bags is a wonderful way to make sure I will have some on hand for quite a while.
1001;Health Food for Cats?;I only bought this because the breeder where I bought my cat said she wouldn't eat anything else. I'm surprised my cat didn't starve to death, because she wouldn't touch this stuff, nor would my other cat.
1002;SWEET AND SAVORY;The Chipotle and Ranch almonds is by far my favorite flavor. It's savory and sweet at the same time.
1003;The genuine article;Red beans and rice is such a simple dish.  Everybody in New Orleans eats it on Mondays, from cab drivers and port workers to businesspeople and Tulane kids.
1004;Yum;Arrived sooner than the estimate and the item was exactly as pictured. I would definitely purchase this product again.
1005;A real hit with my impossible cat;Petite Cuisine Gourmet Cat Food was a real hit with my impossible cat.  My cat refuses almost all canned cat food so I was completely shocked when she showed an interest in this food.
1006;Exactly what I needed;I've recently begun making biscotti and was using anise extract. It wasn't good enough.
1007;Great blend to get the day started =);I've tried a wide selection of k-cups including the big names like Starbucks, Tully's, Donut House, Dunkin Donuts, etc and they all have something in common..
1008;Blackcat;Great coffee!  Love all Green Mountain coffee and all the wonderful flavors.  Would and do recommend this coffee to all my friends.
1009;Yum!;My dog loves getting this mixed in with a little bit of dry food. I have a small pom so i give her a tiny scoop of dry food and then 1/2 a packet of whatever flavor i grab and she loves it.
1010;Not a universal fit;This Pump does not really fit the 64oz. Ghirardelli bottle.
1011;Def a good buy;I got these for $10 for the 24 pack, so a pretty good deal. They are about as healthy as the baked chips I usually buy.
1012;Yummy!;I've used this as a rub on roasts, and an edge on steaks.  It is wonderful.
1013;Great taste, and good for you;Of all the sardines I've tried (and I've tried a lot of brands), these are the best tasting I've ever had. Aside from that, being brislings (the smallest of all commercial sardines), they are practically at the bottom of the food chain, which means (1) they should be almost completely free of mercury and any other toxins that accumulate in fish as you move up the food chain, and (2) their diet consists almost entirely of algae and phytoplankton that are rich in omega-3 fatty acids.
1014;Awesome!;These Mango's are great & my 15 month old loves them as much as we do. Some pieces are larger than others, so we did have to break them up for her.
1015;Beautiful Bonsai;A lovely plant (Brussel's DT8045FF Fringe Flower Bonsai, [..
1016;Great Breakfast Tea;This tea is great for breakfast especially if you don't want a really strong cup of tea.  What I like about it most is that there is no bitter taste at the end as I have occasionally experienced with other caffinated teas.
1017;PitBull's best friend;"I have a little pitty that chews through everything! No toy other then the black ""extreme chew"" Kong has stood the test of my dog Marley. I bought this on a whim after I had got fed up with wasting money on toys marketed as ""super durable"" and for ""power chewers"" that she would demolish in minutes and would ultimately end up garbage in a day."
1018;Favorite dressing;This is my very favorite (and only) salad dressing but it's almost impossible to find in the stores (they only seem to carry the lowfat version, which has an after-taste to me).  So I love being able to order it online - it comes really quickly.
1019;Good chips with an occasional bad aftertaste;These chips are good. Knowing that they're not as bad for you will make you eat more of them - very dangerous.
1020;Hershey's Cocoa Has Gone Down the Drain;I have even written to Hershey's to ask what happen to the Dutch Processed Cocoa (silver can) and they tried to tell me that the new can was the same thing.  Do they think we are stupid?  The cocoas DO NOT even look or taste the same!!!  What's up with Hershey's? Does it have anything to do with their move to Mexico??  I just don't get it.
1021;Love this tea!;Best flavor. I got all my friends hook up on this tea.
1022;My Breakfast Every Morning...;This variety pack, as well as the fruit version (Lower Sugar Peaches & Cream and Strawberries & Cream) are in my desk.  I make a packet every morning when I get to work.
1023;One bottle out of four was undrinkable;I love the product.  However, so far one bottle was good, the second bottle (which I brought as a gift to a party) smelled like old gym socks.
1024;nice somethings don't change;I got my box of cookies today and had the family over for dinner tonight. I was the oldest and only one who remembered them.
1025;Beautiful Tree!;This is a beautiful tree with wonderful trunk shape and nice branching.  I have only received it about a week ago so no leaves yet, which is a good thing since we are still too cold for it to leaf out yet.
1026;WOW...not for the faint of heart or weak of teeth!;I love these chips..
1027;It is better than I expected;I really recommend this product. It is well packaged and protected.
1028;Cheap;Very flimsy material. Not true to size, extremely small.
1029;Party in your mouth!;WOW - this stuff rocks! I was so excited to try a sweet hot sauce, my hubby and I are obsessed with buying new hot sauces, its actually the first thing we look to purchase when we are traveling. I have never seen a pinapple based hotsauce and I couldnt wait to break into this bottle & it did NOT disappoint.
1030;Quick and Fresh!;My biscotti was sent in a very timely manner. I believe it took about two days to get to me.
1031;Superior dog food;My dog has severe allergies, and I'm always looking for superior dog food to try on her.  I ordered Canidae Lamb and Rice canned formula
1032;Great Tasting!;This is a very good drink.  Tasty and not syrupy I really enjoyed the flavor.
1033;So much flavor;This product has so much flavor.Everyone loves this pie even if they arenot Pumpkin pie lovers.
1034;This tea is all about the brewing--has potential to be fabulous;This tea can be awesome if it is prepared correctly. If left too long to brew it turns and can be so bitter it is almost undrinkable.
1035;Filler food is empty, leaves your cat always needing more;This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes.
1036;Yummy and Easy to Make;Prima Taste Rendang Curry is mighty tasty. I'm no expert on Singaporean food, but I have traveled and lived in Asia so like various types of curry.
1037;Does the Trick;"No Fear certainly does the ""energy boost"" trick very nicely.  Taste-wise."
1038;good soup;This is good quality organic soup.  You can add beef or chicken to it and it taste great.
1039;Delicious!;I enjoy this white beans seasoning, it gives a rich flavor to the beans I just love it, my mother in law didn't know about this Zatarain's brand and now she is traying different seasoning and she likes it very much.<br />Thank you Amazon for having it because now I can't find it in stores, I like to have this 12 boxes because I can made it whenever my family want it.
1040;sufficient;gave me plenty of gas..
1041;Wish I would have found these years ago!;OMG!  Why has my vet been keeping these from me?  My vet's office doesn't keep these out where they can be seen but they do sell them.  I only found out about them when I mentioned that giving my cat a pill is not fun.
1042;Terra Sweet Potato Chips;We enjoy the opportunity to purchase the smaller bags of chips and be able to eat them at anytime.  Amazon allows for the different variety of Terra Chips to be enjoyed.
1043;Pleasantly Surprised;Being a peanut butter lover, I decided to try this in my daily protein shakes to cut back on calories. I add 1 serving to my usual fruit smoothie and it blends very well and tastes great.
1044;Doesn't get bitter;I've been looking for a jasmine tea I could drink at home. This one, as some have said, doesn't get bitter.
1045;Delicious;I wonder why it took so long to come out with this,<br />they are sooo good..
1046;Hey, they've made gum chewing fun again!;I am not the gum-chewer in my family: my far better half is and Trident is her brand.<br /><br /> But duty required me to try this product in order to render a review.
1047;Pure summer bliss!;Let's get to the good stuff: as always, I fall in love with the first sniff. Cutting open the corner of the gold foil bag was like a flavour overload! The sweet strawberry scent was too good to be true - and happily for me, it tasted just like it smelled!!!<br /><br />That can be rare in a tea, but I've come to learn that Red Leaf Tea sets their bar just as high as I set mine! That leaves me very rarely disappointed, and almost always happily surprised with the quality, scent and flavour! Strawberry was no exception!<br /><br />(Excuse the amount of exclamation marks, I really can't help it)<br /><br />I ordered by my usual parameters: Basic Grade Matcha with Delicate flavouring.
1048;Tasty and timely;Love this product and LOVE that Amazon offers it as part of the Subscribe and Save program. So much less expensive than my local store and so convenient.
1049;Best Chili Sauce for cooking;There are a lot of Chili Sauces that I like, and it really depends on what I want to use it for, but when it comes to cooking, this is the stuff. I add it to any meat to make stir-fry, chili con carne, Thai dishes, burritos, etc.
1050;HIGHEST QUALITY VANILLA;I use vanilla a lot.  Not just in baking, but I put it in oatmeal, french toast, drinks, and so on.
1051;Santa's House & Toy Shop;I have been buying Gingerbread house kits for several years at Costco and have always been happy with them. This year they changed the style to the one I'm commenting on.
1052;Bought this for the Fiber;Was feeding my 3 cats - Blue Buffalo Blue Wilderness Chicken Dry Cat Food - which is one of the best brands out there..
1053;SOY LECITHIN IS MONOSODIUM GLUTAMATE!!;"Why in the world would you feed your babies these foods with ingredients like soy and/or soy protein! PLEASE! Look into what you are putting into your childrens' bodies! There is so much information on the internet! Some of these ingredients are so bad for you! Look into soy ANYTHING and you will find out it's not good at all! MSG has sooo many hidden names and SOY LECITHIN is just ONE of them!! Just because it says ""Gluten Free"" doesn't mean it's ok to eat! Reasearch, research, research! Your children's long term health is at stake here! Use Rice flour for your cookies if you want Gluten free.."
1054;WOW! Whattachip!;VERY good, arrived fast. Of all the kettle style chips I've had, the thickness of these really pushes the crunch factor.
1055;Palm Oil and Too Sweet - a Bad Combination;"Being a chocolate addict, I salivated when I saw the words ""Double chocolate"" on the box. I added milk and eagerly took my first bite."
1056;sooooooooooooo overpriced;DO NOT BUY THIS.  this is the most overpriced candy i've ever seen.
1057;This is being shipped by Taylor Market, not Amazon!!! Blame Taylor Mkt.;"<a href=""http://www.amazon."
1058;A Winner !!!;This is my fifth chocolate flavored Kcup that I have purchased and tasted. The others being Gloria Jeans Swiss Chocolate Almond (so so flavor) and Mudslide (again it was OK), Van Houtte Chocolate Almond (excellent flavor), Donut House Collection Chocolate Glazed Donut ( smell the brew Kcup and it still smells of chocolate)and now this one.
1059;No taste;I tasted wonderful cheese popcorn at the Palmer House in Chicago and thought this might be the same when sprinkled on hot buttered popcorn. Sorry I had to purchase six as I can't even give them away.
1060;Tasty Gum with no other added faux sugars;The reason I got this flavor of SPRY gum and the truth of the matter is that it tastes VERY similar to juicy fruit, as another reviewer mentioned.  There are no added fake sugars like sorbitol (found in my favorite gum, Trident) which is good in the sense of health (probably), yet the sweetness runs out way too quickly (like the real juicy fruit).
1061;Disappointed;The peanuts tasted fresh, lightly salted and not oily at all. I was disappointed at the small size of the nuts, like the Spanish Peanuts found in the local grocery aisle.
1062;Not so tasty...;I got this tea thinking it would be a nice tea reminiscent of the kind of hot cider drink you might get from a coffee shop.  What I got was a rather unpleasant experience.
1063;A basically nice shampoo;This volumizing shampoo should probably be used with a conditioner from this CLEAR product line, but even without the separate conditioner, this is a nice product.  I'm not sure what a five star shampoo would consist of, so I'm giving it just four stars.
1064;Great Coffee Sampler;This is a good buy.  Great variety of bold and medium coffee, both with caffeine and decaf.
1065;great tea;Twinings Tea has always been a great tea but now that I can get it in a k-cup the convenience is even better.  The only problem I have now is that it is so convenient that I drink much more tea.
1066;Oh yeah!!!!;Husband makes this in a whirleypop popper with bacon grease..
1067;Great Tea;Good basic tea!  I start everyday with a cup. Bergamont is helpful to reduce anxiety, lower cholesterol and protect brain neurons, so double is a good thing! Get it on auto ship so you never run out and save $$.
1068;Very Good if you like spicy;T His is great stuff especially for those who like it hot. I use this a lot when barbecuing and it does the trick it has a very nice kick to it but again its not for those who do not like spicy.
1069;Shipment had bugs in it;I love this cereal but when I bought it from amazon it came with bugs. I don't know if I was just the one in a millionth person that gets a box of cereal with bugs or if its where it was stored before shipment, but it was gross.
1070;Buy this if you have NO taste buds!;"""Blends smooth and creamy for a sweet tasting protein""  is in the item description. I don't know who wrote this but they must not have ever smelled or tasted this stuff! Based on the description, I purchased a few of these bags."
1071;made in the USA and made in Thailand, do they hold the same quality?;I have two cats that are very picky eaters, sometime ago I found out about weruvia and they seemed to really enjoy it. So, in order to keep my furry friends happy and save some money I purchased weruvia online, and to my my surprise one of them would not eat it at all.
1072;Good Bold Coffee;I've been drinking Green Mountain's Dark Magic and really enjoyed it, however I wanted a change.  After some searching I discovered this coffee and am glad I did.
1073;Tastes Good, Hot it's not;"The salsa tastes good as noted in other reviews but after phrases such as ""barn burner"", ""call 911 screaming hot"" and ""remember the Alamo"" I expected something really really hot. Ends up I can eat it with a soup spoon."
1074;Natural and good? i dont think so;I was under the impression when buying these jars of almond butter that they were going to be all natural heathy and good tasting. in fact it was exactly the opposite.
1075;Ok;This stuff is ok, not great but not bad. Trying to find anything made of real ruffle and only real truffle is futile.
1076;great stuff;There's no doubt about it, this is the real deal.  Wonderfully full-bodied syrup with a luscious amber brown color.
1077;Great gum!;Trident Vitality packs have only 9 pieces of gum per pack, as opposed to the similar Orbit White or Dentyne Ice's 12 pieces. However, I usually chew 2 pieces of the Orbit or Dentyne where I only need 1 piece of the Trident as the pieces are larger.
1078;Best price for Hazelnut k-cups;After trying many k-cup flavors, my favorites are Hazelnut and Raspberry Chocolate Truffle.  With the price of coffee escalating, I've combed the online sites for prices.
1079;Tasty but why dairy?;Looking for low carb snacks without dairy or egg (which I am allergic to), I thought this would be a great snack.  It tasted awesome - but I read the label (my fault for not doing sooner) and saw it contains milk.
1080;Excellent coffee;I purchased this for work since we go through coffee very fast.  It makes a great cup of coffee and certainly far better than wasting money on more generic brands.
1081;Delightful Experience;Zebra Cakes may not make you as Kewl as the rebellious, shade-bearing zebra on the package, but that is no reason to disregard this lovely treat.  When kept at proper temperatures, zebra cakes offer a twin-packaged delight that is rarely contended with by other snack foods.
1082;Add it to soups, quinoa, brown rice;I started eating this about a year ago after reading how healthy it is for you.  I add it to many different dishes.
1083;Great taste for a sugar-free cookie;Bought these for my mother online because she can no longer find this particular Murray cookie at the local stores. She likes these and the shortbread cookies.
1084;Great Stuff;Bought this product on a friends recommendation and it was worth it. I took the mix on my family vacation and we enjoyed the perfect combination of morning waffles and family.
1085;Junk;I received my package for this today.  Most of the packages of grits were broken.
1086;Got Progressively Worse...;I love Think Thin Bars.  Love them.
1087;Very Good;I love this too . The main contents are garlic, onion, black pepper, parsley, fennel, basil, bay, marjoram, organo.
1088;KASHI GO LEAN JUST NOT CUTTING IT!;I love granola cereal and since I'm watching my weight, I decided to try the Kashi GO LEAN Crunch. Well, needless to say, it is not satisying my granola cereal craving at all.
1089;Camel Halvah Bars;What a joy to find Amazon carrying Camel Halvah Bar.<br /><br />I have been eating this bar for 3 years and had a job<br /><br />finding someone in the USA stocking it.
1090;love it;"Let's face it, there is no ""Keurig Store"" in anyone's home town where you can walk down an aisle and have your choice of 100's of coffees. I love the coffee and regularly order the 50-pack (in fact, as I type this review, the purpose of my visiting Amazon is to order yet another pkg)."
1091;Too Salty Too Bad;I was hopeful for a crunchy low carb snack and gave these a try. These were okay but too salty for me.
1092;ok tea;My wife bought this at the recommendation of Dr.Oz for blueberry tea to be helpful in some cases of stomach issues.
1093;The champagne of birch/root beer.;My friend Kevin and I are root beer connoisseurs.  We must have tried over 50 different brands, some great, Salty Dog, many ok and a few horrid (who'd a thunk).
1094;Good Tea;This is a good tea,you can make it very strong and it is still better than Yerba Mate(which I can't get used to)as for the caffeine stimulation,I prefer coffee, but I don't get negative effects from coffee,it does have a mild stimulating quality but won't keep you from falling asleep. I liked it mixed with coca tea.
1095;OH SO GOOD!;I am a cookie expert, I've tried them all. This is the best ever, you can eat a handfull  and you dont feel full or feel like you have sinned.
1096;Easy treat;This is like a deodorant bottle with gravy in it.  My dogs took to it right away and did every trick as if I had a chunk of steak in my hands.
1097;FEWER COLUMBOLLA MITES W/ FLEA TRAPS;IM INFESTED W/COLUMBOLLA MITES. I WAS SPENDING $400.
1098;For Fingernails! ... and hair and joints?;I buy 00-size gelatin capsules in bulk, fill them with this gelatin powder and take two capsules/day. Five months later (grow-out time), my fingernails are long and strong, no acrylic required.
1099;Satisfies My Sweet Tooth in A Healthy Way!;It seems impossible that there is a healthy snack that tastes like cinnamon brown sugar but they've managed to do it.  I love these and I always have my cabinet stocked.
1100;Okay;Considering the manufacturer only sent one packet through the Vine program, it's hard to give you a review based on a tea that can be instantly served hot/cold. I tried cold and it took a few seconds to dissolve, but overall it tasted okay.
1101;Kind Bars are the Best!;This box of Pomegranate Blueberry Pistachio & Antioxidants is delicious as is all the Kind Bar products.  They are a great choice for a balanced, satisfying, nutritious bar very low in sodium and without gluten.
1102;we love Annie's Bunny Grahams!;First of all, they taste great.  That's what matters most to kids.
1103;Out of Date by 6 months!!;"Shipment of pods came with a best-before date that was a full 6 months before delivery. Be aware that Amazon lists all ""grocery"" items as non-returnable."
1104;Great pill pockets;Pill pockets are great! My dogs love them. They are soft so perfectly hides the pill medication we give them.
1105;Vegetarian and Very Tasty;I have searched for a good vegetarian jerky for several years.  There have been some hits but more misses.
1106;Special treat for any occasion;Have bought this product since '90s and always a winner. Product always fresh and presented creatively.
1107;Lovely flavor enhancer;If you like vanilla, you will enjoy the taste of this mixture. I don't put sugar in my coffee, but I gave this a try and it was delicious.
1108;Scrumptious!!;Robert's Smart Puffs are not fake orange-colored like the big corporate name brands.  Very cheesy and oh so delicious.
1109;Great mixed with cabbage and peas;This curry is pretty strong and bold by itself. I still like it, but there's not much to it (it's just a.
1110;Absolutely Delicious!!;I first tasted these pancakes at a friend's house. His niece lives in Hawaii and sends him a few packages at a time.
1111;An addictive potato chip;Eat at your own risk.  Once I would open a bag I could not stop.
1112;Don't buy it!;I would not ever buy this again. Sickenly sweet and very artificial tasting.
1113;Great;My kids love these!  They have a great flavor and, for us, are preferred over Sharkies.  My daughter sometimes gets stomach aches from fruit snacks, but has had no trouble with these.
1114;Great Product;This is a great product and with coconut oil it tastes just like the movie theater popcorn. I would recommend this product to anyone who likes the movie theater popcorn experience.
1115;Chocolate flavor is too strong;I love that the cartons don't have to be refrigerated.  They actually taste better at room temperature than they do when cold.
1116;can't live without coffee;I can do without a lot of things but I can't function (or be happy!) without my coffee.<br /><br />I like a good,strong (not bitter) cup of coffee.
1117;best espresso out there;LOVE THIS ESPRESSO, NEVER BITTER HAS A LIGHTER TASTE BUT IS TERRIFIC TASTING,I MAKE MY CAPPICCINO EVERY MORNING.NOT A DARK BLEND.
1118;Very good snack. Tastes great.;This is a great snack. I bought the same brand in Vegas and just love it.
1119;Great pop!!!;This is some great pop from the midwest, a serious classic in Detroit (where I come from) and Ohio. They have great flavors like Grape, Red, Rock N Rye, and Cream Soda.
1120;Tastes good, but not real healthy;I have eaten in various restaurants operated by Wolfgang Puck and have always found the food to be delicious.  This soup is no exception.
1121;Pop Chips are awesome;Taste is similar to regular potato chips but without the guilt of eating something so bad for you.  They make a great snack.
1122;Just not very good;"I had high hopes this could be a money-saving alternative, but the quality just isn't there.  Put me down for ""eh."
1123;Healthy Dog Food;This is a very healthy dog food. Good for their digestion.
1124;So Far This Dog Food Is A Winner;My husband researched dog foods as we looked for one to transition our puppy => dog.  Our vet encouraged us to go off the puppy food and because our rough-and-tumble aussie has a sensitive digestive tract we only wanted to do this once.
1125;It's OK;Good price.  Overall OK coffee.
1126;Reese's Pieces Candies;So delicious I can't wait to buy more of them next month. Fresh and delicious.
1127;"Great product - Enough review reading already! Just click the ""Two-Day 1-Click Free"" purchase/deliver button.";Dogs love them. Mess free.
1128;Not what I ordered.;I never ordered this product. I ordered Henry's Blend which was the description that was offered.
1129;Very good healthy drink;A couple weeks ago I went over to my mom's house and she offered me one of these ICE drinks. I was surprised how good they were and instantly went on Amazon to look for them.
1130;Dale's Steak Sauce;A Great Steak Sauce best used when applied to steaks and burgers while they are cooking. Unbelievable flavour.
1131;Just Okay;I ordered this cake mix because it has less chemicals and especially for the lack of partially hydrogenated oils.  The reviews were very good and there was a coupon available so I thought I'd give it a shot.
1132;MY DOGS LOVE IT!;The UPS driver just delivered the first bag of food for my dogs to try.  Their interest was peaked immediately upon bringing the package into the house.
1133;We love it;We really like the nutty flavor, and have it every morning on our breakfast cereal.  We are moving away from GMO's toward organic foods!  Try it you'll like it.
1134;Pill pockets;These are the absolute best way to give your dog pills.  My dog loves them and doesn't seem to know that there are pills inside.
1135;Love the mustard.;I love the mustard for making my hot sweet mustard. The problem when ordering I got the cans broken open and it was a mess.
1136;Lipton Tea;Fantastic for making good old southern style sweet tea. Consistent quality and a good price from subscribe and save.
1137;This one is my favorite!;I've really enjoyed the taste of this Coconut Water and have it on my Subscribe and Save items.  It is a reasonable value, considering the price of various coconut waters, and it tastes really good.
1138;Love this Breakfast Blend-great gift;Stocking stuffer gift for family.  Love this brand & blend.
1139;Surprisingly tasty, crunchy, not too sweet;As a lover of more hearty cereals like Grape-Nuts, I was a little worried this one might be too sweet.  Instead, I was pleasantly surprised to find that, sure, it reminded me (a lot) of Frosted Flakes, but was better.
1140;Delicious;I had some at a friend's house and I liked it. I had to take lactaid tablets because milk just doesn't sit right with me but I'm not totally lactose intolerant.
1141;Dog loves them, makes life easier!;I have a fussy eater on my hands and a VERY smart dog.  I've used hot dogs, banana, peanut butter, etc.
1142;Disgusting! Waste of Money!;I can't believe I wasted almost $20 on this. They were burned! They were inedible! It was so nasty and they took forever to arrive!<br />You should take this product off of your product list.
1143;ONE is the best tasting coconut water on Amazon!!!;Coconut Water Breaks up Kidney Stones!!!<br /><br />People who have kidney problems and are plagued by kidney stones should drink this great product in addition to taking their medication. Drinking coconut water regularly helps to break up kidney stones making them easier to push out.
1144;good stuff;this red clover tea is worth my money, i have shed 8 pounds in 3 weeks, i know its not a diet tea or anything but, i drink this twice a day eat my 3 regular small meals, and a fruit or a rice cake or something lowfat, the tea coupled with better<br />eating habits and i ride my exercise bike and do a few stretches, lunges, lift a 5 pound weight in sets of 5's twice, for<br />about 15 minutes total2 times a day, nothing long and drawn out. before 3 weeks ago i honestly weighed 199, that's a lot of weight if you are 5'2, mostly in my butt and thighs.
1145;Good Stuff!;This is a very good product for any price. People knock it a bit because of the corn but I've spoken to Eagle Pack and have found they are very open about their product.
1146;coffee;i have never tryed diedrich k-cups before and i thought i would try it and the price was right. the taste of the coffee was great.
1147;Great Gu for a great price;This was one of the best prices I could find for Gu.  I'm a long distance runner, so this stuff is a staple in my diet.
1148;Dark Color, Watery Flavor;Upon opening the single packet, I smelled something that did not smell like coffee. Because I'm a polite person, I can't actually say what I smelled.
1149;I love this cereal!;My favorite cereal, hands down. I could eat it for three meals a day (and sometimes do) quite happily.
1150;Nutiva organic coconut oil;This has been the only coconut oil I have used for the past year. It has my such a difference in my health.
1151;Great Formula!;I have used this formula for both of my boys and it is great. I love the fact that it's organic and both of my picky boys have loved the taste.
1152;Love spearment tea;I bought this product and love the flavor.  A great and relaxing way for me to end or begin a day.
1153;vegetarian good food;We have been using super links for many years, and they are the best tasting links we have found. If you fry them in butter they are scandalously delicious.
1154;To me these are well toasted or dry-roasted;The nuts arrived very quickly (with reg. $5 shipping).
1155;Lots of dogs getting sick from this product (including mine);"Be sure to do your homework re: this product before purchasing.  I have three dogs, and they were all getting sick once Canidae changed their ""formula"" late summer to early fall."
1156;Great Tasting and Healthy.....;These cocoa covered almonds are great tasting and make for a healthy snack choice. They have a great chocolate flavor to help with those chocolate cravings we all seem to have.
1157;You won't be sorry...;This product does exactly what it says it will for you. It especially helped with my anxiousness and body tension.
1158;Nice mild flavor;These shortbread heart biscuits are very yummy with tea or coffee, and are a much healthier substitute for shortbread cookies.  They have a nice crumbly texture and good mild buttery flavor, with no aftertaste.
1159;Health Valley Cobbler Cereal Bars, Blueberry;I purchased these for my daughter's lunches.  she works in warehouses and drives tow motors.
1160;sitting on the shelf too long.;"This was not a ""fresh"" product.  My cats (nine total) normally love this product, but it had that old smell to it."
1161;Easiest way to get the BEST coffee...;When that other place that starts with a W..
1162;Great pruduct but overpriced.;"The Highmountain jerky cure is the best that I have tried but if you are interested in buying this don't do it here because you can find it at Basspro shop for half the price.<a href=""http://www."
1163;If You Like Sweet Potatos, You'll Like These.;I am glad I got a whole case of these, simple because, after the first bag (keep in mind, these are small single serving bags), I was not impressed, and the sweet potato flavor overwhelmed me, but after eating my second bag, I liked them, a lot!<br /><br />  They are a little salty, but still sweet, and they are a bit akin to the chip version of a baked sweet potato with some butter and maple syrup, or at least that's how they tasted to me after getting over the initial reaction anyway!<br /><br />  My husband ended up eating the majority of them, not because I didn't want to eat them, but because he liked them so much!  It took little over a week for him to eat 2/3 of the box..
1164;Great for dorming students who do not have access to a refrigerator;My teenage son is lactose intolerant and has no refrigerator in his dorm room.  He uses the ZenSoy Soy-On-The-Go Soymilk, Chocolate, 8.
1165;Greasy;This salami was so greasy when opened it, it literary poured out grease. I tried eating on two separate occasions and gave me the runs and cramps so bad, I couldn't even go to sleep.
1166;DEEEEEE-FREAKING-LICIOUS!;1.  I love  Amazon's grocery/makeup/cleaning products subscription service.
1167;DOG FOOD;DOG FOOD SMELLED GOOD WHEN I OPEND THE PACKAGE. SORRY TO SAY, MY DOGS DID NOT LIKE THE FOOD SO MUCH.
1168;DO NOT BUY...MADE IN CHINA;I'm very disappointed when the company promised our offices they were a USA company, then I find out that they are actually manufacture in CHINA, and only distributed in the USA. I no longer will buy any Dogswell products.
1169;A bit worried...;I was first introduced to this GF flour at a local GF Expo in Oct 2011.  A free 4-lb.
1170;For those who prefer to use Splenda;First there was Splenda plus fiber.  Now there's Splenda with B-vitamins.
1171;Great Garlic Bread;We have been buying this garlic ramano sprinkle for over 10 years, amazingly I found it here for much less money, shipping only took a couple of days. If you like garlic bread you gotta give this a try.
1172;Dry, Hard, Bad;Very disappointed in these cookies - I was hoping for a something great and ended up with extremely dry cookies, some were already broke on arrival and others broke by just opening the individual bags. The cookies are small - the image here makes them look a decent/normal size but they really are a bit smaller.
1173;Love these!!!;I'm on Weight Watchers and LOVE these bars!<br />They are just the right snack tool I need to get through my day.  Thanks for a great product.
1174;Great Apple Sauce;Fantastic apple sauce. Large containers in recyclable plastic jars.
1175;Cranberry Pumpkin dog treats;In Alex's (my dog) opinion, they don't quite compare to liver treats, but he readily accepts them.  Since he is supposed to be losing a few pounds, they help cut back on his daily caloric intake without depriving him of a little snack now and then.
1176;"""Awesome!!!! "" said my daughter-in-law";I got these chocolates for my son and my daughter-in-law for their 10th wedding anniversary.  My son said the chocolates were fantastic, and my daughter-in-law -- a gourmet in many categories including chocolates -- said they were awesome!!!  And I give the company 6 stars for customer service.
1177;Great product;This product is great. I saw one negative review but I can tell you my order was large and I had no issues.
1178;Good, but too sweet;Nice flavor, but far too much sugar - the cheapest ingredient. Needs more katsuo! I'll return to my more expensive preferred brand, which is about 50% more expensive per jar but still a better flavor value for money.
1179;Saves you the hypoglycemia;"If you have hypoglycemia, this will give you hours of relief! I take two twice per day and no longer suffer much from the headaches and shakiness. I can go longer between snacks and rarely have that ""I have to eat or die"" feeling."
1180;Decaf. White Tea w/ Raspberry: Simple, Unsophisticated;I ordered this because I enjoy white teas, and decaffeinated white teas are hard to find, which is what I prefer iin the evening.  The taste is simple and clean, which is the goal of a white tea, but is not very exciting.
1181;A Bit Gritty;I wish I could say these are just like Nabisco graham crackers. I think their intention was good, lots of organic ingredients and all.
1182;Chocolate without soy lecithin;I am committed to getting unfermented soy products out of my diet.  I find that most chocolate candies use soy lecithin as an emulsifier.
1183;Butter Toffee almonds are sooo good, but hi-carb;I've tried several of the Blue Diamond jar almonds and the Butter Toffee almonds are the best.  They would probably be my favorite almond, but they're high-carb.
1184;Tasty, but be aware of nutrient content;I like this product. I think it is quite tasty both to drink and over cereal, and I haven't had any problems mixing it (I shake it in a quart mason jar).
1185;Great;I despise low-fat/non-fat dressings and would prefer to eat a salad plain rather than use them. In addition, I don't like Thousand Island at all.
1186;Easy and DELICIOUS!;So easy to use and super delicious, I'm glad I could find it online because my World Market stopped carrying it. I am a huge fan of Indian food but my husband isn't.
1187;INCREDIBLE TASTE;This is the best product Blue Diamond sells, at least in my book. Spicy bbq flavor, like eating chips, but a much healthier alternative.
1188;Belly flops??  I think not!;These were great!  The only irregular thing that I found was the shape. the flavors were great.
1189;Great coffee;This is currently my favorite coffee..
1190;Great all ginger tea;This is all ginger root tea. The tea bags come in a resealable bag to keep them fresh.
1191;Great Product;Our family really likes these toaster pastries. It's an organic product that tastes good and healthier than the non organic type.
1192;$40.00?;I placed an order for this on 4/18/2011, and it was $28.59.
1193;Good cup of coffee;OK I admit I am a Starbucks junkie, but my monthly expenditure is out of control. This is really almost as good as what I order at Starbucks, but it is half the price.
1194;Best dog food ever!;I know my review is a little out dated from its earlier posts but, I love this food for my 2 labs.  I have never fed them anything else.
1195;Very Good Light Roast;"This is a very good light roast with just a slight hint of a heavier roast background. It is a consistently dependable ""coffee house"" flavor."
1196;Salmon Treats could be better;I've seen people offering these to their cats at cat shows, so I thought I'd try them on my cats.  I learned right away that I have several issues with them:  (1) They have kind of an off-odor, almost like turpentine.
1197;the best coffee;it's the best if you like dark and bold. my wife thinks it smells foul but i like dark coffee, chocolate, and beer.
1198;Sweet Sunrise Coffee;I Love this coffee,the flavor is great. I had gotten my first bag at a discount store,then I went back and bought all they had.
1199;Awesome;"My wife and I love them. We are on our way to a RAW diet and these are great to make a meal more ""meaty""."
1200;the perfect snack;I love this product for my 4 year old. I pack one in her lunches and carry one in my purse at all times.
1201;Excellent Light Output and value.;I added these lights to my shop. Originally I was using two 4' fluorescent tubes.
1202;Honey is Sub-Par;This honey was quite unlike anything I had experienced before. The flavor had a pervasive bitterness to it, unlike any clover honey I had tasted in the past, and I could only describe it reminiscent of extremely over-brewed tea.
1203;They are great;I saw them advertised in the Weight Watcher magazine and gave them a try. I love them.
1204;There is no taste;If you have ever had real Cajun style gumbo, you know this Campbells version does not compare at all. There is no flavor to this soup at all! I don't know what everyone else is thinking, but I will not buy this soup ever again.
1205;superior than white rice..;this all natural organic blend of wild and brown rice is tasty, with more flavor than store-bought white rice.  Plus, it is more nutritious than white rice.
1206;Great, healthy treat;I have a picky eater, diabetic dog.  She has to eat before I can give her insulin.
1207;Orgain Sweet Vanilla Meal Replacement;"<a href=""http://www.amazon."
1208;Maddy's lime cookies;These cookies are totally addicting!!  Don't dare order them too often. Originally, we were able to buy them at Costco.
1209;Great tasting coffee;This coffee tastes great and arrives fresh and ready to brew.  It is a nice dark roast that is 100% Kona, not a blend.
1210;Best ever.;"I stumbled on this baking mix while searching for another brand, which I couldn't find.  This is the best ""substitute"" I have ever found."
1211;the best;Best cookie ever - if there are Glutino Lemon  Wafers on my kitchen shelf, I can sleep well at night..
1212;Treat Yourself;This great product from Folgers ought to be available in every grocery store in the country.  If you want to drink more than one cup of coffee a day, or if you are afraid of too much caffeine, this is the coffee for you.
1213;My favorite;I drink a lot of different teas.  This tea is my favorite tea.
1214;Dessert disguised as a jar of peanut butter;I expected very little when a friend gave me a jar of Dark Chocolate Dreams as a gift.  I have tried other peanut butter concoctions and have found all to be, well, miserable.
1215;Bllue Mic Icicle;The Icicle is an excellent product, works as advertised. I think it's the easiest way to attach a quality mic directly to your computer.
1216;Peanut Butter & Jelly of the month club;We are really satisfied with our 1st shipment. Both the chosen peanut butter and jam companies that were included in this month's selection are independent businesses who use all natural ingredients.
1217;Excellent taste and combination;of milk chocolate and marzipan (almond paste).  I have tried other brands but this is the very best.
1218;Good stuff!;Nice, smooth cup of Joe. High recommend.
1219;Best cookie ever!;Who doesn't like Walkers shortbread fingers?  Buying these on a regular delivery plan is perfect
1220;Great product.;Although pricey, my husband cannot have processed sugar, and it's hard to find a really good tasting substitute for cooking and baking.  This works well for reciepes that need a granular sweetner that stands up to heat.
1221;Misleading Picture and Description;This item sold and shipped by [..
1222;My favorite energy bar;I've tried a bunch of different energy bars and this is my favorite. It's not as heavy as some, is quite satisfying, and is not too sweet.
1223;Fantastic addition to every meal;I love shallots.  Sadly, you cannot add them to everything while they're still fresh.
1224;Yummy;"Tastes great, and it's cheaper than buying it in the stores.  For some reason, it is the ""official"" candy of yoyo'ers and my son always takes some to yoyo championships."
1225;Didn't not like at all;Didn't not like this at all. Didn't taste good and we hated it so much that we threw all of them in the trash.
1226;Best way to give glucosamine that I've found;My dog loves these treats. I love how much more fun it is to give him glucosamine and chondroitin in a treat instead of in a pill or a liquid.
1227;Better than a candy bar;Amazing snack, hard to eat less than the whole bar. Great to have on hand when hunger hits.
1228;Most excellant alfajores!;Have tried different brands and Havanna is the best.  I prefer the all chocolate-covered best.
1229;bad salt;this salt has an obvious odor of some chemicel. beware! Unless you plan on using in a bath, i would stay away from it.
1230;delish!;I was looking at our local World Market for a sparkling Moscato and this one was recommended. I was a little skeptical because it costs a lot less than the one I normally get.
1231;Good coffee but NO hazelnut flavor;This really is good coffee. It's smooth and goes down easy which is why I'm giving it five stars.
1232;Does not compare to Duncan Donuts;I tried this to see if it would taste the same or close to Duncan Donuts & I'm sorry but it doesn't come close. At first it taste good but then there's some after taste.
1233;3 paws up;This is the first time Lily ever saw this toy. She was able to move the parts and figure it out easily.
1234;Favorite and hardest of the 4 Busy Buddy toys we own;"<span class=""tiny""> Length:: 2:25 Mins<br /><br /></span>Loaded with a cup of kibble, this toy occupies my 60 lb German Shepherd puppy, Batman, for 30 minutes, which is impressive. It's our favorite of the Busy Buddy treat-dispensing toys."
1235;Both dogs love it!;"Both of the dogs love this Lickety Stik. It took one of them a bit longer to figure out the ""roller ball"", but once done, they both love it."
1236;a tasteful indulgence;I love this tea. I was grateful to have the decaf version for late at night.
1237;AMAZING purchase, we are so HAPPY!!;Mine came in the classic raw hide color the ecru/off white color which didn't really bother me but i thought i should mention it since the picture shows a brown color one.<br /><br />It is HUGE and it is made for chewers!!<br /><br />I am so impressed with this because I've had it for about 2 weeks now and my 7 month old Labrador Retriever (which can pretty much chew through anything) finally managed last night to cut off a chunk and made it look like a smiley face now.
1238;Expired, or just nasty?;I have been using Amazon for years and I've never written a review. This is the first, and it's because I feel as though I've been completely ripped off.
1239;Not a PDQ Tray of 6;"My dogs love all the Dingo products so when I saw what looked to be a surplus ""pdq tray"" of six bags per tray under the product features I thought what a great deal! Unfortunately, it was only one bag :( It's too much trouble to send it back for a few bucks.."
1240;yummy grown up cereal;This product is great! It is not too sweet and you can eat it as a hand-held snack.  Total is noticing Kashi is good enough to affect their sales.
1241;Awesome Products, Great Deal;This is a great deal. They give enough of each product to try multiple things with each chemical.
1242;Pretty pleased with tea;The tea appears as pictured in the stock image.  I found it to be of good quality.
1243;Great Product - Fast Shipping and Cheap Unit Price;This was a great order.  The unit price was right around $1.
1244;Great popcorn at a great price;As a lover of popcorn, over the course of my half century on this planet, I've pretty much run the gamut on the variety of ways to eat this delight -- over the stove, the air popper and then by nuking it. All were fads that faded over time.
1245;awesome idea!;These are so great for on the go. My 1 1/2 old loves them all.
1246;Could of been better;The Oyster Stew could of been better if it would of had whole oryster's in it. All there is, is pieces of the oryster.
1247;DELICIOUS;I got the exact same thing with a different brand name (Fit & Active) for $1.29 at Aldi.
1248;Happy with Crystal Light Fitness Grape;Product arrived promptly and as stated in Amazon advertising.  Much less expensive than supermarkets and I like that it has natural ingredients.
1249;Skippy Peanut Buter 0.5 ounce cups;This 100 pack of Skippy Peanut Butter was ordered for a church food pantry. The product arrived after about 4 weeks and was in good condition.
1250;Good Stuff!!;"Just got my boxes of cereal yesterday.  If I had a sugar scale for this cereal where 10 was ""Frosted Flakes"" and 1 was cardboard, I'd give it a 4."
1251;Good simple coffee;I like all of the flavors except the Dark Magic.  I'm good with strong coffee, but that one just has a not-so-pleasant flavor.
1252;Good Stuff!;"Impressed with taste and strength of brew. If you like French Roast K-cups you will like ""Jet Fuel""! Quality product."
1253;Jean from TN;I drink a lot of water and Crystal Light makes it more pleasant..
1254;My yorkie maltese loves these bones;I have a 16lb yorkie maltese who loves these bones.  They tend to last several weeks for him.
1255;Great taste and service! What a fortune...;This is the second time in 3 months we have ordered fortune cookies from Greenfire and again the service and cookies are impeccable. People were amazed to see that the fortunes were personalized and complimented us on the fact that they had never tasted such a fresh fortune cookie in their life.
1256;Nice little tweek;Overall, I notice no change in the sweetness or flavor of this sugar substitute through the addition of the B vitamins. The usual slim paper packet has been replaced by a slightly more bulky thickened packet to preserve the nutrient content, but otherwise the product can be used in the same manner as the original item.
1257;Dusty;The product taste wise is very good. I found it a little expensive or 1/2 pound.
1258;The only thing setting it apart is the skull;I have had my fair share of energy drinks..
1259;Grab if you like Jack Link's;I personally hate both this and Jack Link's.  GARBAGE.
1260;Dog Loves Treats;Dog loves them - lots come in the pouch.  They are smaller than I thought they would be - I was hoping I could stuff a kong with them - but they just fall right out - but they are great small treats for training etc.
1261;Awesome!;"There's a great cinnamon note to these licorice.  You can taste the ""realness."
1262;love this coffee;We are almost out of this coffee so I know I have to order it again or I will be missing it's wonderful smooth flavor. I don't consider it a strong French Vanilla flavor, just enough of a hint to make it extra special.
1263;Don't get these if you have a sweet tooth.;I tried the carob-cocoa flavor. These are not at all sweet, even with malted grains, honey and raisins in the ingredient list.
1264;Good stuff!!;Two level measuring teaspoons makes at least 30 ounces of tea, good strong tea that is highly stimulating.  I don't even miss coffee now!  Using distilled water makes the best tea in my opinion.
1265;Delicious (I Know!);My cats ADORE this cat food, they cannot eat it quick enough. And, I hate to admit it, but the pleasant smell and lack of by-products tickled my curious side as well.
1266;Not so much!;This purchase was disappointing. It was a part of a Christmas gift for my daughter, the selection was poor, the packaging was a brown paper bag with a label.
1267;Review for the Hi-Protein variety;Simply put these are great pretzels. High roasted flavor, though my cousin said it tasted burnt, and proceeded to eat more.
1268;Saddened;"I accidentally ordered this when I wanted the ""Butter"" Chicken curry paste. I thought it would be good either way."
1269;Strong after taste.  Not good.;I wish I had bought a single packet before committing to the case.  My baby made a horrible face when I gave this to him.
1270;"Great ""on the go"" snack.";My son (1 year old) loves these bars, they're just his size.  I like them because I can throw them in the diaper bag if we're going to be gone for a few hours.
1271;Excellent;I only purchased one box of this hot chocolate at first because I was concerned that I wouldn't like it.  I tend to be a bit snobbish with hot chocolate and will go thru great lengths to make a good cup.
1272;Good Lights Bad Q/A;I received a second set of 6 Bulbs, and for the second time, only 5 out of 6 worked. Otherwise, I like the bulbs.
1273;price keeps increasing. . .;i have enjoyed this product for quite some time.  however, i am disgusted by the fact that the price keeps increasing!  at $35 per case, customers are paying more than $4 per box for 5 small cookie bars - ridiculous!  i will find a healthier, more reasonably priced snack to munch on.
1274;Extremely salty;Definitely won't buy these again.  Very, very salty.
1275;My cats love this stuff;"My cats were never very enthusiastic about dry foods - ""premium"" or otherwise - until they tried this stuff.  Now they get quite huffy if I try to give them any other brand."
1276;Good but not great;I tried the simply asia hot & sour soup for the first time today, and it was pretty good.  To be honest I found the soup to be neither hot nor sour, it was actually pretty sweet.
1277;best chocolate ever;i have to disagree with the reviewer who said these are not as good as godiva - no disrespect to godiva chocolates, i enjoy them, but imho these bury godiva or any other dark chocolate i have ever had.  i treat my self to 1/night.
1278;"Do not let the ""Indian"" spices scare you, it's great!";Wonderful product.  Cooked perfectly.
1279;Good...But Have Questions;Prompt arrival.Good packaging.
1280;Chicken Cheese Enchilada Soup, Please Come Back;I have never been much of a soup person, unless down with a cold or too tired to cook up something fancy.  Once heated, I crumbled tortilla chips on top (or even some shredded cheese).
1281;Artificial Tasting and leaves an aftertaste;Well I just heated up my first bowl of Oatfit and was ready for some warm good oatmeal on a cold morning. Unfortunately I had to spit it out after the second bite.
1282;Great !;"My Rottie's digestion has improved over 95%.  No more vomiting, ""doggie"" gas and increased energy."
1283;Can't live without greenies;My cavalier king charles spaniel and a friend's beagle can't survive without greenies!!!  Fantastic product and great seller..
1284;Preschool;Happy Puffs are the prefect preschool snack. I brought them today to my son's school and the kids were begging for more! I also like the the sweet potato is gluten free.
1285;great product and happy to support it;We use this coffee at work and I like it better than almost all the other brands. It works well, tastes good.
1286;Its The Best Quality So Far;I have been using Spectrums brand for a year now. I use it for hair, cooking, oil pulling, as a body moisturizer, and as a air fresher in my oil burner.
1287;My Dogs Love It!;Lickety Stik is an all-natural dog treat that comes in a deodorant-like container with a roller ball on top.  The idea is when your dog wants a treat, you give him a few licks of this lo-cal product instead of something more fattening.
1288;Cats LOVE the food, I hate the mess of packaging...cats win.;I've had them try every type of Whiskas. .
1289;Delicious Italian Candy;If you are a lover of Italian candy, this is the candy for you.  It is a soft nougat torrone, and truly delicious.
1290;Spice me UP;Loved this spice..
1291;The best brownee mix you can find.;We purchased this product because we are gluten intolerant.  Our expectation was that it might be almost as good as regular brownee mix.
1292;Pumpkin Pop Tarts CONTAIN NO PUMPKIN!!!;Well many pumpkin pie cans out there don't either, they are made from squash.  But that is not on the ingredient list either.
1293;Better than Twinings;Stash has spoiled me for Twinings English Breakfast, which now seems bland by comparison. Stash E.
1294;Bold flavor Earl Grey from a K-Cup!;I have purchased other teas for my Keurig, but none have produced as strong of a flavor as this Bigelow Earl Grey. I have tried all kinds  of brands and blends of tea K-Cups, but none can compare to these.
1295;Great Product;I've used this product before and I just love it in fact, I like this better than olive oil and or the other types of cooking oils. I don't know what the calorie content and I don't care because clarified butter just makes everything taste better.
1296;Tastes very good, but melts way too easily;When I am short on time to eat a proper meal, one of these bars and a beverage fits the bill.<br /><br />If I eat one of these and have a large coffee or a glass of iced tea, I won't be hungry for 3 hours.
1297;great product;I was amazed at how well these cleaned my dogs teeth. He is not happy with getting his teeth brushed, especially in the back, the Greenies have assisted with cleaning this hard to reach area.
1298;Yummy and convenient!;It tastes good for the convenience and has enough caffeine to get me through a work day.  It comes in packets that are easily split up if you are sharing, or good if you need them on-the-go.
1299;Best instant coffee out there;If you have to drink instant - this is it.  I buy these through amazon and at my local grocer and take with me when I travel, as I hate the cofee in the hotel rooms.
1300;These crackers are fantastic;Tasty, crunchy. No gritty taste.
1301;Quick treat and they love em;"Like the title says ""Quick"" your dog can devour one of these and will come back for more. This version of the product is pressed together and easy to chew."
1302;Awesome!!;I like this shake very much. Even though there are no vitamins unlike Ovaltine, this is a good powder that i use to enhance the taste of my protein drink.
1303;Awful taste at first, but you'll get used to it pretty quick;When I first tried this protein, I mixed it with rice milk only. It was so hard drinking at first, it tasted like dry broccoli blended with dirt.
1304;Tasty Bliss;Oh Glorious day when I found the best snack treat on Amazon.  Just like hot wings, except in pretzel form.
1305;Chocolate Lover's Dream;I am a health nut who loves chocolate. This frozen dessert is absolutely fabulous! I can't go a day without it.
1306;"""Bully Sticks are the best"" (from the dogs point of view)";My dog will not chew on anything else sonce I gave these to him for the first time about a year ago. I don't mind though since I know that these are all natural, and knowing the risks of giving him rawhide.
1307;Love these pill pockets;My black lab needs to take a large fish oil capsule daily for allergies and these are perfect for wrapping the capsule.  She goes crazy when I rattle the package to get her pill ready.
1308;YUM;I didn't buy this product off Amazon (sorry, guys!) but I normally buy it at school for a quick and mostly healthy snack in between classes. I'm surprised at all the negative reviews.
1309;Please, for your own sake, don't;Generally, the flavored Vita Coco varieties are anywhere from alright to very good tasting.  However, this one is outright unpleasant.
1310;dog-gone good;okay, it's true our dog was used to the few stale varieties of dog food available in our remote location, but I still think it's the quality of this dog food she likes.  At any rate, she eats it all immediately.
1311;12 for $12, Why not.;Taste pretty much exactly like movie theater popcorn when used with coconut oil.  You only need to add a little otherwise you'll have it to salty.
1312;Um Um Good Great Tasting Sugar;Florida Crystals is the best tasting sugar I have ever had.  I was looking for a natural, less processed, and great tasting sugar for canning and I found it.
1313;tastes a little salty at first;I usually drink tap water and can only compare this to that experience. I used to drink city water which was treated with Chlorine which I would purify using a Brita water pitcher.
1314;An Excellent High Protein Snack;I really like the NuGo Free high protein bars.  It's gluten-free and very satisfying.
1315;Tasty and Good for You!;This is the perfect morning perk me up.  The tea brews nicely and has just a hint of jasmine flavors (not overpowering at all).
1316;Yum;I love these sweet nuggets of goodness!  I mostly use them in oatmeal but I'm sure they'd be great in baked goods, too.  They're rolled in oat powder so they don't stick together.
1317;Waking up with a hot cup of coffee;For coffee lovers who enjoy a strong  cup of coffee in the morning then French Roast is the coffee for you. It has a rich bold flavor that will kick start your day.
1318;taste;This is my favorite kcup. It does not taste a lot like coffee, which I like.
1319;My favorites;I love Jolly Rancher Stix because I can break it in pieces and enjoy it for longer time while I'm working or simply watching tv. They came well package and solid, no broken pieces.
1320;A tea for tea drinkers!;"I have been drinking tea ALL my life and this tea ""Russian Royal Tea"" is at the top of my list.<br /><br />This tea is bold and very rich in flavor, it's pure Cylonian tea leaf packed in Sri Lanka."
1321;Organic White Silver Needle Tea;This particular vendor's Organic White Silver Needle Tea is very good and much less expensive than others I have tried.  It too offers a very subtle flavor and is very light on the taste buds.
1322;Dark and Sweet;I love Decaf Cafe Verona, especially in whole bean.  It's definitely one of my favorite roasts.
1323;The best you've ever tasted!;"This was marketed in conjunction with a ""big box club"" and a manufacturer of an outdoor grill.  Upon subsequent visits to the ""big box club"" we could not find it!  I contacted the manufacturer of the grill and they said it was a ""label over"" product by Durkees."
1324;My picky eater, picked Chef Michael's!;My elderly dog (15 year old beagle) can't see much any more, or hear much, but she still really enjoys her food.  Zoe usually turns her nose up at anything other than her regular food, but not this time.
1325;Must have for Brats!;"I was looking for a Dusseldorf style mustard for my brats but my store didn't have any so I picked this up since it was from Wisconsin, the home of Brats.  It made my Oregon brats taste just like back home, perfect! This is great mustard, hot but not too hot, spicy with a good ""bite""."
1326;Great with lemon martinis;"I usually rim the glasses full of lemon martinis with this and everyone loves it.  But I also make ""kidtinis"" for my daughter (variety of fruit juices) and put this on the rim for her."
1327;I appreciate the service and quality of the product.;"I appreciate the service and quality of the company and the<a href=""http://www.amazon."
1328;Good and tangy;I agree with the other review, these chips are not for a sore mouth or tender gums. The chips are very hard and the taste is delightful if you enjoy the salt/vinegar combo.
1329;Easy crock pot meal for cool day;Ordered this on a whim, and it is quite tasty. I put it in the crock pot and let it simmer through the day and although the noodles were extremely soft, it was still a tasty soup.
1330;A bit small but delicious.;The 40 packs are 1 Oz each, thus very small. Keeping that in mind, all the bags were delicious and extremely portable.
1331;Best pistachios I ever had & most consistent;I buy pistachios a LOT. When I say a lot, I mean about once a month or so.
1332;Ground control, Can you hear me?;If you drink a lot of coffee (like me) and you want a pick me up then this is it. If you have cardiac problems, uncontrolled high blood pressure or anything remotely similar go for something else.
1333;These are a favorite from the past;I loved these growing up and still do.  They really don't contain a lot of calories and now I have to hide them from the kids.
1334;Some Like it Hot!!!;Woo-hoo y'all..
1335;Good but a bit grainy;Newman's Own Organics Dark Chocolate Bar, 2.25 oz.
1336;I'm Just Not Addicted...;With so many other glowing reviews, I feel a little ashamed to put my own lukewarm review in.  Kashi GoLean Crunch! has 7 whole grains in it, which means puffed rice is mixed with oats and rye and other grains to make clusters.
1337;Great Buy!;Beats buying those little containers at the supermarket that do not last long. Used a lot already since I received.
1338;Bowl is fine, but sticker packaging is crap;This Stainless Steel MIRROR PET DISH 1QT 144 is exactly what it says it is, and is fine in and of itself. However, the huge advertisement sticker that covers the entire inner bottom of the bowl is impossible to remove without spending a good hour or so scrubbing it off.
1339;love this product.;i am a big fan of no fear.i only wish shadow beverage whould make it avalable in my area.
1340;delicious and not too sweet;If you like extremely sweet things, like fudge, you might be disappointed by this.  But if you're looking for a comparatively healthy way to enjoy intense dark-chocolate flavor, give it a try.
1341;good taste and better than a snickers bar for you;There bars are pretty tasty.  But you are never going to find something that is nutritious and tastes better than a candy and chemical bar.
1342;Still trying to scrape the flavor out of my mouth :-P;If this was the only gf mix available, I'd probably kill myself. I tried using it to make the brownies on the box a couple of weeks ago and they came out awful.
1343;stinky tea;Seems to help, I sleep well and if I do wake up I'm not long getting back to sleep.<br />I ordered two boxes and I'm about to buy two more.
1344;Healthy and Tasty;Eating just oatmeal is good for you, but it doesn't taste that great. But muesli tastes really good and is healthy.
1345;Worth every penny!;I recently had to go gluten free.  I have disliked so many products, because I can't get used to the tastes of some of the flours.
1346;Very Tasty;I'm always looking for healthy snack alternatives. But healthy snacks are not always very tasty.
1347;The missing ingredient for Movie House Popcorn*;This is the 'flavor' of movie house popcorn. You will also want to use the oil too.
1348;Blend function broke;The idea is great. But after 2 months the blender broke.
1349;Delicious Product;I love true lemon.  I could not find it in stores any more where I live so I had to order the product online.
1350;This is Puppy food;The title doesn't say it, but this is puppy food and not adult food. That's why it has oatmeal in it so it will be gentler on puppy's stomachs.
1351;Good Idea Gone Bad;"My family is trying to avoid food coloring and I cannot find this product in a local store.  I ordered (1) case of Cherry & (1) case of Grape ""flavored"", ""Invisible"",  Kool-Aid."
1352;Nutiva -  Coconut Oil Organic Extra Virgin, 54 oz. solid;I have used a different brand of this product previously.  But had I not, it would be helpful to have information on what the product is beneficial for.
1353;Great taste, smooth texture!;Silk Chocolate Soymilk is a great tasting, rich, smooth alternative to milk.  If you are like many people I know and have a touch of lactose intolerance or just prefer a more healthy alternative to milk, then this is for you.
1354;If I could give it negative stars, I would!;I was very excited about this product, then I recieved it! It tastes like metalic/ plastic. It's a weird taste very hard to describe.
1355;Good Bold Taste;I've had Dark Magic, Starbucks Pike's Place, and Starbucks Sumatra.  Out of the three, I prefer the Dark Magic, especially given the price.
1356;The Definitive Sports Snack;Big sporting events. .
1357;Great stuff!;This is the first coconut oil I've used and so far I love it. It moisturizes my 40-something skin very well! It also leaves my lips so soft! Will definitely purchase this product again.
1358;Torani Blood Orange Syrup;This is a very difficult flavor to find. You virtually cannot find it in stores, but it is the most delicious of all the Torani flavors.
1359;Great way to wake up;I've been drinking these little 5-hour energy drinks for a while now and I have to say that it's a great way to get a boost to your day. I was having a hard time waking up in the afternoons (you know, after lunch, the work day just drags sometimes and puts you to sleep) but taking one of these gave me the energy I needed to get through the days.
1360;Great alternative;My son can't have sugar due to an enamel deficiency and this is a treat that is fine for his condition.  He gets left out of so much, and it is nice that he can be allowed to chew gum.
1361;Ok but not great;These are VERY thick gummy worms, comparable to a sharpie marker in thickness.  The gummy is ok but not spectacular, and the sourness is about average.
1362;Best product, Easy, time saver;I am a new mom, my daughter just turned 7 months on 2 weeks ago, so i decided to make her some baby food by my own. i've been comparing the brezza and beaba, but i finally got the brezza because of the one step processing feature.
1363;Delicious;As someone on a limited budget, it's often difficult to find high quality green tea at a reasonable price. Brands like Ito En offer high quality, pre-brewed 'iced-tea' style drinks, but these can be quite pricey.
1364;Popular with my dog;My dog loves the taste. Even more importantly, she tolerates them very well, which is not always the case as she has a very sensitive stomach and is normally on a limited ingredients diet.
1365;It's OK to drink the water in the can;It's OK to drink the water in these Del Monte French Style Green Beans cans because no salt has been added and lead has been banned from the canning process in the U.S.
1366;I love my luv pops!;What can I say..
1367;You know the product is good...;You expect the product to be good. The cool thing was the shipping ended up being free and it only took a couple of days to get to us.
1368;Very Good;Not the best gummy rings out there. They are very good though.
1369;Great quality, tasty treat.;Not my favorite flavor but I love any Jerky from this supplier so no complaints here. I don't think you will either.
1370;Great alternative to Gerber;I had a hard time finding organic single grain cereal at the store.  All the grocery stores including Central Market and Whole Foods were completely out of the Earth's Best, and I don't really like the Gerber organic.
1371;FOUND IT!!!!;Everytime i go to Europe I look for this particular chocolate bar<br />There's nothing better then RUM TRAUBEN NUSS.IT does indeed remind me of rum ice cream YUM YUM<br />Now the best part about finding it, is that it is my husband's gift for Father's day.
1372;Finally found some;My husband went to a Seventh Day Adventist boarding school back in the 40s and of course, Choplets were on the menu.  We are not vegetarians but love them as a breakfast side instead of meat or on a bun for lunch.
1373;Good with coffee;These appear to be, on first glance, similar to Nutter Butters.  On taste, however, they are lighter, more delicate, and infused with hazelnut.
1374;Absolutely Delicious;This is absolutely delicious. However, the shipping is a bit too expensive.
1375;Delicious!;I had recently made a molded chocolate camera with these Candy wafers. It arrived in perfect condition, none of it was clumpy or melted.
1376;Best Ice Cream EVER!;I had this ice cream once. It was the best ice cream I had ever had in my life.
1377;Great product;I bought one of these for my Siberian husky house dog. She recovered from a serious injury and cannot romp and play with other dogs.
1378;"There is better coffee, but this is one of the best and convenient ""Instant"" brews!";Need that coffee but a pot of fresh-brewed just isn't available?  Starbucks VIA Ready Brew Italian Roast Coffee (I also like the Columbian) is a good alternative.  And this 50 count package is the way to make these cups economical.
1379;Mix Nuts Healthy Gift;I sent a box of this mix nuts to my parents and to my brother's family. It arrived quickly and they loved it.
1380;"A delightful alternative to ""flavoring""";Read the ingredients - the three items used to flavor these are sea salt, tomato paste, and chipotle powder.  I would say the tomato is barely noticeable.
1381;Very tasty, Mild odor only!;I read the reviews before ordering this product and agreed this would be a better product than the one bought in a health food store earlier. I was surprised at the improvement over the one I just finished.
1382;Great snacks for anywhere, anytime!;I've always loved almonds, but this is just so convenient for on-the-go snacking. Not only can I eat it while I'm hiking or camping, but it's also great for anywhere where I don't have to carry around a knife and jar (which is most places :) ).
1383;Good moisture benefits;I first saw this shampoo at Walmart. I was a little reluctant to buy the full size bottle.
1384;Cats like this food;I have been happy with the quality of this food as well as delivery time & speed. The cats tried tearing into this bag before their old food is gone yet.
1385;Tasty Tea;I bought this for my mother who tasted the tea in a restaurant.  This is now her favorite tea.
1386;Great product;Loved this product. I am not a big milk user.
1387;So Happy to find this vendor!!!;This is a fantastic deal!! My dogs love greenies but at over $20 per bag at the local pet supply store, I couldn't afford to give them one everyday. I order these again and again.
1388;Neat idea, awful pancakes;I bought this for someone who loves red velvet cake. It was a neat gift, but the pancakes aren't very good and have a strange consistency.
1389;Not the best deal around.....;I usually rely on Amazon to find the lowest prices on almost every item I need to buy.  However, your best price on K-cups tend to run around .
1390;food for grandkids;I do not use these pre-packaged items. My grand kids love them.
1391;Delicious;Use distilled water and boil water just to the point that it starts to boil.  Pour approximately 6 oz of water over teabag and let steep for 4 minutes.
1392;Gatorade Propel Zero Powder Sticks Cherry Lime, 10-Count (Pack of 6);Nasty. Too sweet and the cherry totally overpowers the lime.
1393;Add a little spice;"When ever my husband and I go to PF Changs he always asks for this sauce - most of the time he has to tell them what the bottle looks like and were they keep it in the back.  So for his Birthday I bought him his very own bottle - he was THRILLED!  It adds a little ""kick"" to just about any dish and is great on sushi (so i'm told)."
1394;Taste like artificial little fluffy cardboard;I bought these - based on the great reviews.<br />They're horrible - taste artificially sweetened and there's a powdery substance left in the bag.
1395;Do not buy this item;when i brought a pack of 6 kraft dessing the expiration date was out of date..
1396;Just like Nature Valley Bars;They taste and look exactly like Nature Valley Bars. Also note the 10-count box is 5 packages of 2 thin bars.
1397;our fav gf muffins!;Ours DO brown on top but not always and come out a decent size. They're not rice-y in my opinion and even my 3yo who isn't allergic to gluten/wheat loves them.
1398;Dog loves it;I trust this product and trust the company.  My dog does extremely well on both canned and dry.
1399;Great and essential for bread making;If I don't use this, my bread doesn't turn out and doesn't hold together well at all.  This is a must for any yeast bread I make, especially whole wheat and one box lasts a long time.
1400;My favorite - Decaf on the go!!;I love this coffee, and am so happy that I found the Starbucks Via Ready Brew in Decaf on Amazon.  I was already drinking this coffee on a daily basis, but was purchasing it from the local Starbucks stores, and paying a much higher price! And then I found it here on Amazon for a much more reasonable price.
1401;good jelly;I gave this wonderful jelly as a Christmas gift for my father-in-law as well as my father and they enjoyed this very much.  I especially enjoyed the two jar package.
1402;LOVE IT;The Marley coffee is the best aroma and taste. It provides a true coffee experience that lets you know this is special.
1403;better than so-so....unbelievably awesome!;"The following review I wrote last week.  The title was  ""better than so so"" --without the awesome part which I just added."
1404;A step up from Ramen;When this went on sale at my local grocery store, I decided to give it a try. For the most part these heat and eat Asian meals are unsatisfying.
1405;Very tasty;Very good quality and fresh! I use it when I bake bread, but it's excellent just sprinkled on salads.<br />I like the fact that it's packaged in reusable glass jars.
1406;good taste!;All the bars are healthy and they taste great.Also, you know how much calories you are taking, which is helpful for weight control.
1407;flavored milk straws;very disappointed..
1408;Good basmati rice;This is a good rice. Have water:rice ratio of 2:1 and the rice comes out fluffy.
1409;Best Granola Bars;The dark chocolate nut is awesome.  The Fruit and Nut is pretty good as well and the price is excellent.
1410;coffee;This is the best decaf I have found.  I use 8 ounces of water and have a nice, rich cup of coffee.
1411;Pretty much what you would expect;First of all, I was not sent the item described
1412;Can't resist them!;I frequently skip meals when I'm on the run.  These bars have 10 grams of protein and they're delicious.
1413;Great Green Tea;This is an excellent green tea. I enjoy this brand and one from Biglow.
1414;Good concept, brittle plastic;I bought this toy for my 9 month old lab and had to return this twice. My dog loved it, but he dropping it on our hardwood floors and the bottom twist off part broke with each one.
1415;Fun to Squirt!;So I have to confess - I absolutely LOVE these things.  I love almost all the flavors, and this Mango Peach is at the top of my list, next to Strawberry Watermelon.
1416;Delicious! Vegetable Enhancer!;I received my first bottle of this Viking Smoked Salt as a stocking stuffer. I like to cook and I started using it w/everything! I feel this really enhances the flavor of the veggies.
1417;Good Tasting but Not Great;"Switch promises ""A perfect balance between juice and carbonation"" and it does live up to that as it delivers a fresh burst of stawberry and kiwi (the kiwi could have been a little stronger) and less carbonation then your regular sodas.  And it is a bonus that it is 100% Juice with no sugar added and no preservatives<br /><br />My main drawback is the can as the tall thin can is a little too small and regular soda cans that are shorter and thicker and stream out better than the taller, thinner ones like Switch."
1418;another good prepper product;This product is great for those who are trying to be prepared for emergency situations. The long term storage ability is good and knowing it is used all over the undeveloped world is good too.
1419;Toxic Waste are the same as Warheads;Toxic Waste vs Warheads? They taste almost exactly the same except Toxic Waste has a sour core to it. Lemon is the most sour flavor.
1420;Crunchy and great taste;I really like this cereal, it stays crunchy in milk and is more filling than some other gluten free cereals I have tried. It has a hint of sweetness and smells like maple syrup but is not too sweet like some cereals.
1421;Splenda;Great value.  Love not having to go to the store to purchase these anymore.
1422;Keep the British foods coming!;I found Heinz baked beans on Amazon by chance a year or so ago and since then, my British-born husband and I have been thrilled to see all the latest offerings that have turned up from over the pond.  My husband has been here for 15 years now and really misses his Branston Pickle, HP Sauce, Ambrosia custard, so it's absolutely marvelous to be able to buy these things at a reasonable cost from Amazon -- and certainly saves money versus searching the small imported foods stores around.
1423;Beautiful metallic copper colored cocoa for fine toppings;Great stuff. Used it as a dusting for truffles and flourless chocolate cakes.
1424;O.M.G the best. Try Grade B!;If you haven't tried Grade B yet it is a huge difference. It is so good!!! We are in love.
1425;error in product features description;I love these candies but there are no blue ones in any pack.  There are only 5 colors/flavors.
1426;I Love This Candy!;I never bought this candy online but I bought it at an oriental store for one reason only. The first reason is because the name of the candy and the makers of the candy.
1427;average candy;i would say this candy is a good choice if you are a cinnamon and hot&spicy lover. on the other side is't just a jelly candy with cinnamon glaze so after a while the flavour is gone and the jelly without any specific taste remains.
1428;Kona Blend Senseo coffee pods;This a full bodied, rich coffee with a wonderful flavor.  I would recommend it to everyone.
1429;GREAT Honey;This Special Honey Has Many Healing Benifits.<br /><br />I found it Works Great for cold sores.
1430;The Best K-Cup Flavor - Chocolate Glazed Donut;Keurig's Donut House Chocolate Glazed Donut blend is truly the best K-Cup coffee!  It is strong with a sweet chocolate taste
1431;Kimbo;"While traveling in Rome, I discovered Kimbo coffee. I have tried all the ""other"" brands in my Starbuck's espresso machine and find this brand to be the best espresso to make at home."
1432;hot apple cider;I love cider, and this is the next best thing to it!<br />I have to stay away from too much chocolate so this will replace hot chocolate for me especially on cold winter days.<br />It is really good.
1433;Shocked at how good this is;"Not sure what I expected, but certainly not something that tastes darn near as good as peanut butter.  Seriously, other than the ""work"" of having to add some water and measure it out, it mixes remarkably easy and tastes fantastic."
1434;Wonderful Seasoning to Use on Everything :);This is the best seasoning we have found for use on salads, pastas, in cottage cheese (try it!) ..
1435;Best Kettle Chips!;As a professional potato chip muncher, I see these as thee very BEST on the market. Rich taste and flavor!! Almost impossible not to finish the entire bag.
1436;zen;i don't like black tea because they have a bitter taste. i love this tea.
1437;Dog loves these;My young boxer really loves these pig ears. They are small, so they can be used as a reward for most dogs.
1438;Ocean Spray CranPomegranate Drink Mix;My favorite drink - just add ice and water. Can adjust strength to preference.
1439;Everyday Vinegar;Reasonably good red wine vinegar with a nice strong edge. I use it all the time for salads and also to perk up things like soups and marinades.
1440;My cats LOVE IT!;Let me start off by saying, my cats are brats. They are finicky and often will stop liking a bag of cat food half way through.
1441;canterbury microwave fudge;i love this fudge, it's very rich and easy to make.  the only problem i have with it is trying not to eat the whole batch the first day, i try to make it last but it's so good that is not easy.
1442;Best flavor and best price of any Blue Diamond almonds!;The flavor of these is just amazing. They are really addicting.
1443;Game Changer;You are reading the review for a reason. The reviews speak for themselves.
1444;This one is my favorite;Of the Better Than Bouillon lineup, I've used chicken, mushroom, beef, vegetable, ham and lobster
1445;Not Bad, But Not Great;This was OK.  It tastes more like juice to me.
1446;This is my lifesource!;Although admittedly not very healthy, having tons of sodium and MSG, it is delicious, quick to prepare and cheap. Just throw a bit of everything in the pot when you make it.
1447;Took me back to the island;I really enjoyed this coffee. I love Jamaica and have been there 8 times and this coffee tasted just as good as most of the coffee that you get there.
1448;Great deal on dog treats;These Hungry Dog treats are a great deal on quality dog treats from Merrick.  There is a large variety of chews and treats in each bag which is perfect for my three dogs.
1449;Kyjen Dog Games Treat Wheel (Misc.);I have a 95lb pitbull/ mastiff mix that often loves his rope bone and his squeaker toy and thought it would be great to challenge him with some thinking toys.  I was a bit weary of this toy because my dog might chew up the plastic treat covers but found they are rather tough and that food incentive was greater than the chew incentive.
1450;Missing Pouch and awful customer service;The product is great. The tuna has great taste and is delicious.
1451;One of the best teas....;I've been drinking this tea now for 3 weeks straight. The first weeks I was only drinking in the morning after my workouts and it really helped boost my energy in the morning and was a great part of my morning breakfast.
1452;Delicious Dark;I love this coffee!  It's the next best thing to espresso.  If you like your coffee strong and dark, without being bitter, this is for you.
1453;Product has changed and now tastes just like microwave popcorn;I tried this product about 2 years ago and it was just like movie theatre popcorn at that time but since that time, they must have changed the product and now tastes more like a microwave popcorn that lacks flavor.  The packaging has changed to include a separate salt/butter flavor compartment and the oil is now a liquid instead of a solid.
1454;"Yummy ""Emergency"" Food";Healthy Choice Fresh Mixers, Ziti & Meat Sauce is a very convenient food to keep on hand. It would be great to keep in your desk at work, dorm room, or take on a trip.
1455;I love my Senseo;I am so happy everytime I make my Senseo coffee.  I especially like the variety pack and the prices on Amazon are great for the product.
1456;GREEN MTN COFFEE ROCKS!;Coffee was a great value, and this is a bold coffee that'll knock the cobwebs outta your brain in no time.  Shipping was unbelievably fast and all in all, a great transaction.
1457;Maxwell House Wake up roast;This coffee had to be the the worst tasting that we had drank in over 60 years. It tasted stale just plan bad ,like it has been around before I was born.
1458;My otherwise disinterested cat CLAMORS for this!;This is a preliminary review
1459;Even my 3 yr olds will eat this!;This flavor has less calories than some of the others, and is a bit like a rice crispy treat with a layer of chocolate.<br />Lighter tasting than other bars and still 9g protein, 6g fiber and 20% calcium.
1460;Not exactly what I expected;The cake arrived askew (smooshed, like a smiley) more due to the internal packaging -- it looks like it should have been vacuum sealed.<br /><br />Overall the taste wasn't what I expected - it was kinda yucky/pasty.
1461;Keebler Graham Crackers - Individual servings;Crackers were very fresh.  Serving size was as listed.
1462;So Good and fresh tasting!;I bought this because I am on Weight Watchers and didn't want to give up PB. Only 1 WW point per Tblsp.
1463;Kona makes the difference;We've been using the Senseo machine for several years now and these new pods are the tastiest so far. Disappointed that Subscribe and Save is not possible on this blend (at time of writing at least).
1464;Awesome healthIER snack option!;I first had Popchips last week at a local deli in Miami. I was so impressed with them that I came online to find them (not even remembering the brand name) and I'm so happy that my favorite online retailer Amazon offers them.
1465;All cans are dented;As another buyer mentioned here on Amazon, all four cans arrived with major dents. It seems they are getting rid of dented cans by shipping them sight-unseen to internet consumers.
1466;Yum!;Mmmmm..
1467;My dogs love it;My dogs are Yorkshire Terriers and so their mouths are small. I've fed them Bil-Jac for many years, starting with the puppy food.
1468;too mild;i like a darker roast i guess. Its ok, prob would not buy again.
1469;Green Chai a big hit!!;I have not been able locally to find the Chai Tea in the Green, only black and mixed black and green. This is light but very aromatic and flavorful with just a hint of sweet.
1470;Best orange curd........;This curd is excellent.  Wonderful orange flavor.
1471;quick, healthy, and delicious;I'm really liking the new microwaveable Barilla meals, especially this one.  It's stored in the cabinet, which makes cooking time much faster than similiar meals that are frozen, and it tastes so fresh.
1472;Not good;I bought the 16oz package after my previous supplier was back ordered. The ginger was dark, springy and had an off flavor.
1473;$100 bowl of salad;No plural there. One bowl.
1474;Love Liquorice!!!;I quit smoking about 3 years ago.  The Altoids Liquorice mints helped me kick the habit.
1475;Taste bud satisfier!!;These snacks are totally tasty and satifying!  I take them to my beach volleyball tournaments and EVERYONE wants them.  I've started giving them to my friends as birthday gifts.
1476;My cats love them!  =^..^=  MEOW!!;As soon as they hear me pick up the bag, the cats come running!  They absolutely love these treats!!  I put these on subscription so my spoiled kitties won't run out. =^.
1477;Soup is good!;Recommended on a Dr Oz show to eat before your dinner. This soup takes away those hunger pains so you do not over eat.
1478;Very Good!;I absolutely LOVE mango Juice my package arrived pretty quick and tasted delicious. It was sweet and tasted as if I squeezed the mango myself.
1479;Great Stuff!;This is the morning cereal to keep you going.  The non-sweet taste takes some getting used to but I love adding my own fruit or healthy things to go with the great crunch.
1480;great peach flavored black tea;As a previous reviewer stated,this tea is a wonderful balance of peach flavor and black tea.I am a traditional tea drinker and could never tolerate those 'fruitty' herbal teas as they are not really tea at all.
1481;Totally Devoured;Our toddler absolutely loves these and compared to the sugar laden alternatives, this is a great product. So far the only flavor he hasn't taken too is apricot, but these are by far his favorite flavor.
1482;Good for you and taste great!;I come from a high-fructose soaked nutrigrain bar eating family, but these are MUCH BETTER. The texture took a little getting used to but now I couldn't go back to the old stuff if I wanted.
1483;FRS Hype??;I purchased FRS powdered drink for the energy it would provide (so the packaging suggests).  Like many people, I work during the day and the evenings often times bring on another part time if not full time job.
1484;Great food, but better prices elsewhere;My dog really seems to like this food, and it treats her well.  She has never had an upset stomach or anything from this.
1485;Best Lollie EVER!!!;Kept hearing about how great these were & after reading all the positive reviews I finally pulled the trigger.  Can't believe it took me this long.
1486;So, So, So Good!!!;I have a matcha latte every morning with Almond Milk. I dont think I could go a day without it now.
1487;Zuke's is the best;Zuke's is the best and my dog loves to eat them up..
1488;Yum!;Since my husband and I met 16 years ago, there has been an ongoing struggle with the lucky charms..
1489;Great Pasta!;We absolutely love this pasta.  It is great, a small portion makes a person fill full, and a healthy alternative for those gluten free.
1490;"""Kind of Dry""";"Yesterday, I shared my ""Quaker Stila Crispy Oat Cookie Bars"" with my husband and son.  The first words out of my husband's mouth were, ""It's too dry"" and my son said the same."
1491;A consistantly decent Lapsang;I love Lapsang Souchong tea.  If it doesn't taste and smell like a campfire (my wife says probably combined with old socks) I'm not interested.
1492;Very tasty, but...;I wish they would include nutritional information in the product description.<br />Was wanting something natural, but not so high in calories.
1493;Nice condiment;I bought this because my husband wanted to try the French sea salt as it was recommended on a cooking show.  The grinding mechanism works well and he seems to like it.
1494;Good Things Come in Stinky Packages;I have very bad insomnia and panic attacks, and this tea calms me down and helps me to sleep. Research suggests that Valerian works on the brains in similar ways to benzodiazepines, and was used in the past as a muscle relaxant and for DTs.
1495;Delicious Raspberry fig bars!;First, I second the comments of some who have noted shipping issues.  My shipment came with the cookies very tightly packed in a single box that was of less than sturdy construction leading to some crushed packages.
1496;Tasty;For those who favor brown rice over white, this is not a bad choice at all. Maybe the price could be a deterrent but the flavor and quality of the rice make for a tasty serving of brown rice.
1497;Matador original beef jerky;I bought a bag of this for 3 dollars and 50 cents at WalMart. I hadn't seen it before.
1498;Try This;Look, we all know that HEINZ TOMATO KETCHUP is a fantastic flavor enhancer for a wide variety of foods (especially French fries). But this, ladies and gentlmen, THIS is what HEINZ TOMATO KETCHUP was made for:<br /><br />*1.
1499;simple;This is the best and most simple form of a Kraft Caramel you will find! Perfect for baking, melting or snacking. Recommended these to everyone I know.
1500;Lemon Lover's Tea With A Kick;This tea is one of my favorites.  It's a caffeine-free tea that has a wonderful lemon flavor with a bite of ginger.
1501;Sahale Snacks;This is one of the most delicious snacks we have ever eaten.  I will order them again for sure.
1502;The Worst Repellent;This product is a total waste of money!! I think it actually attracted the squarrels to my roof..
1503;Strong artificial taste plus another synthetic sweetener in it;This product is sometimes advertised as having no aspertame in it, which is true. But it still has an artificial sweetener in it - sucralose.
1504;Fresh and Real;This is the real McCoy. Now I can investigate bigger packages / quantities.
1505;Awesome;Closest to regular Oreos among the organic ones..
1506;Awful, old chocolate;"Do not buy this product.  It is either not actually ""made to order"" or the manufacturer has no idea how to make chocolate."
1507;Good Munchies ...;These are fun. It's weird that some of the colors don't have the flavor you expect, but it's still good.
1508;No One Ate Them;I was hoping that these would be good quality, but no one at our wedding ate them. I did not try them myself, but was told they were hard and didn't taste very good.
1509;TOTALLY ADDICTING!!!!!!!!;These chocolate covered dried cherries are AMAZING!!!!  If you like Tart Cherries you will LOVE these.  Grew up in MI and now live in GA and have to mail order them.
1510;This Tea is a Must Try;"The flavors of this tea are spicy, rich and complex, but nothing stands out too strong screaming ""this spice is overwhelming.""  When preparing ensure your water is sufficently heated and that you streep the tea for a minimum of 5-10 minutes."
1511;High-rise and heavenly!;"I have baked two loaves of bread with this mix.  Both have turned out fantastic!  The resulting bread rises to a high loaf that is ""normal"" sized and slices evenly."
1512;Compost not potting mix;"I keep buying a bag every year to see if they have changed their methods of production but as the saying goes ""you get what you pay for"". This used to be a great product but starting a couple years ago they stopped screening it."
1513;Bulletproof is right!;UPDATE: Old morning routine - stumble around in the kitchen, tripping over the dogs' beds while I rinsed the coffee pot, dug out a filter and filled the basket with coffee, poured water into the coffee maker, and waited 10 minutes for the pot to brew.  NEW MORNING ROUTINE: Stumble into the kitchen (some things never change), drop a k-cup into the machine, put my coffee cup under the dispenser, and Nirvana pours from this lovely machine in under 30 seconds from heat up to fresh cup of coffee! And if I want a second cup? Pop in another k-cup and the magic happens all over again.
1514;Garden of FakeLime Detergenty Flavors and other Natural Flavors;"I'm just going to say it: These CHIPS Taste like DETERGENT.<br /><br />Given that Garden of Eatin' blue corn, and red hots chips are my favorite of all time, it's puzzling how they can produce such an unfortunate product as ""Chili & Lime""."
1515;Chews;This seem to be less full of chemicals than many chews I have bought.  All my dogs really love them.
1516;A real winner -- with true roasted peanut flavor;I grew up with peanut butter being either Skippy or Jif, and truly had no idea it could be this good. Not too sweet, nice roasted peanut flavor, and no added sugars to worry about.
1517;Mild and Pleasant.;A very mild, but pleasant blend. Not as strong as I normally prefer, but the taste is so good I drink it anyhow.
1518;A Little Bitter;The Earl Grey tea is a little on the bitter side.  Interested to find out if it is just the brand, or if it is due to the brewing process.
1519;Green Mtn Fair Trade Coffee from Amazon.com;Love this carmel vanilla flavored coffee and the convenience of the k-cup. The fact that Green Mtn supports Fair Trade is a definite bonus.
1520;Best instant coffee available;Simply put, at least for my taste, this is the best instant coffee you can find in the grocery.  I'll buy nothing else.
1521;BBQ with a Thai twist;The only drawback to this product is how hard it is to find. Amazon to the rescue.
1522;Go Raw Ginger Snaps;"The picture on the website shows the package that lists ""organic ginger"" as one of the ingredients. However, the ginger snaps that I received have a slightly different packaging from pictured and there is ""ginger powder"" instead of ""ginger"" as one of the ingredients."
1523;Highly Recommend;I ordered a box of the Mesquite Lime after finding the Texas BBQ at my local organic grocery store. I love both flavors but am glad I got a bulk of the lime.
1524;Zuke's Hip Action Is GREAT;We have been giving our 100 pound shepherd/lab/collie/husky mix Hip Action since he was a pup. Our vet believes this is realy going to help him prevent all the hip problems that shepherd's usually have.
1525;Great flavor for snacking;"The Jalapeno Smokehouse almonds taste great and are a nice healthy option for a snack. The flavor is bold, but not overpowering or ""hot."
1526;Absolutely delicious -- and addictive;One of the best store-bought cookies I've ever tasted ..
1527;Great ginger flavor;This cookie tastes great.  I only gave it a 4 because it is a little dry.
1528;Finicky cat loves it, ingredients suck;As far as my cat is concerned, he'd give this 5 stars. He's an extremely finicky eater, but he is obsessed with this food.
1529;Despite the organic labeling, not all that healthy a choice;"""Salmon+crackers"" is advertised as a ""ready to eat meal."" At just under four and a half ounces net weight it 's more of a snack than a meal, but leaving that aside, I found many other issues with this product."
1530;Stay away from the Mint Truffle!!;I usually don't do reviews, but with this one, I just had to.  Mighty Leaf Tea in general is GREAT!!  But stay away from the Mint Truffle.
1531;Royal Blackberry Gelatin;This is one of my favorite Gelatins.  Add bananas and walnuts and it's really good.
1532;Hangover Helper;I hate to admit it, but one day I drank too many cocktails.  A margarita, followed in quick succession by two cucumber-basil martinis (delicious, by the way) at my fave local Mexican restaurant.
1533;great flavor;This is great coffee especially if you like a bold flavor.  If you use this product you will be satisfied.
1534;Salt is salt - it tastes like (surprise) salt;I bought this as a package with the Cuisinart battery salt & pepper set.<br />The salt, sealed in a plastic bag, was wet & would not grind.
1535;Refreshing !;Because I'm not a drinker I can't say how the drink compares to the alcoholic version, but I can say that the taste of this drink is minty and very lime. There is a slight after taste because of the artificial sweetener but I drink crystal light all the time so I am used to it.
1536;my favorite k-cup;I bought the Tully's Extra Bold sampler pack because I got some Tully's Kona with my Keurig and while I like all the flavors in the pack (French Roast, Kona, House Blend, and Italian Roast), Italian Roast is by far my favorite.  A little sweet, fairly strong, no bitterness or smokey flavor.
1537;Incredible Coffee!!;I've loved Dark Magic since I discovered it shortly after buying my Keurig and it is my favorite.  Recently I decided to try decaf and ordered this coffee.
1538;Yummy;I love to mix jalapeno and cheddar to make jalapeno poppers.  It tastes so good and low calories.
1539;Sensible Foods Crunch Cherry Berry;Think freeze dried and you have the consistency of this product. You actually re-hydrate it in your mouth.
1540;great;Great service ,2day I had it, we had the salmon for dinner that night.The box design was very well done .
1541;Less lemon and less zing;Everything is ok, except it just isn't as good as it is in the bags.  Just considerably more bland -- less lemon and less zing.
1542;Most delicious way to get your green tea fix;I really don't like green tea - it tastes bland and well, too green.  But I love this tea.
1543;Excellent and easy chicken;Wonderful spice mix.  The included chicken recipe is quite simple -- basically just season cut-up chicken and bake with potato wedges.
1544;How to make my cat happy;If my cat could write, she would tell you how much she loves Fancy Feast Savory Salmon Flavor Cat Food.  This is a perfect size for one cat.
1545;Some early details about the new Blu-ray DVD due out September 16th, 2008;Beetlejuice is a very Tim Burtonesque Tim Burton movie, establishing his fascination with the macabre and, especially in this case, the funny, campy side of death and horror.  It's the story of a newly dead couple (Geena Davis and Alec Baldwin) who are essentially stuck as ghosts in their house, and don't like its new owners (parents Jeffrey Jones and Catherine O'Hara and daughter Winona Ryder).
1546;Like Candy for Your Dog;"Dogs love these treats more than any other treats I've ever found.  In situations where other treats fail to get our dog's attention - <a href=""http://www."
1547;Only treats our cats will eat!;We have a very picky cat. He turns his nose up to well-loved kitty delights such as Fancy Feast, Friskies, or anything too low-brow for his tastes.
1548;Up Cork!;A pleasure to read the glowing reviews here for this truly fine brand of tay. On an average day stretched to include morning, noon and night I can honestly say I must drink upwards of fourteen or fifteen scalding hot mugs of Barry's Gold Blend and not a bit of a bother on me neither during the entire length of the duration.
1549;Cut my dog's mouth :-(;As a previous reviewer stated, the wells for the treats in this game were too narrow and deep for my dog's nose/mouth to reach the treat. The very first time she tried it she cut her mouth on the plastic edges and started bleeding.
1550;My husband loves these!!;I bought these fat free wheat free fig bars for my son, and both he and my husband love them.  I was impressed by the flavor and these fig bars are moist.
1551;My Favorite K-Cup;My wife and I have decided hands down, this is our favorite K-cup. We've tried a lot of others, and Donut Shop and Caribu Daybreak are certainly still up there.
1552;Tasty, but not quite like real eggnogg;Overall, this tea is really tasty. It smells like real eggnogg, and tastes somewhat like the real thing if you add milk or cream, and sugar.
1553;Pretty Good Waffles;This mix makes nice crispy waffles but the flavor was surprisingly bland.  Next time I make them I'll throw in a tablespoon or two of sugar and see if that helps.
1554;PopChips have ruined other chips for me!;I &lt
1555;great..;this product is great..
1556;Healthy, crunchy, tasty snack;My title pretty much sums it up.  The are light, crunchy little nuts with just enough salt to add a little punch.
1557;An experience worth having.;This tea has a smoothe earthy flavor. It definitely fits into the catagory of organic health foods for its purported nutritional content as well.
1558;Very fresh!;I first started using Sumac when I found some in a Persian food store in North Vancouver, many years ago. Having recently run out of a supply that lasted me many years, I tried this brand from Amazon, which seemed to combine good value and reasonable quantity.
1559;IF YOU LIKE REALLY ORDINARY COFFEE...;My husband and I agree that this brew is really ordinary. If you don't like espresso, or strong coffee, this blend if for you! It reminds me of the coffee I used to drink before finding Lavazza, an Italian coffee we've drunk since 2007 when we came home from France with memories of that divine espresso.
1560;It does what it should!;I have a home-bread maker, and the wheat bran adds another dimension to my bread-making. i.
1561;Another Cottie conumdrum;(ASIN: B004INAQMM)  Well, here we have white fish, with Cottie's beloved cheddar cheese.  But his consumption of it is not on par with that for the tuna, not by a cat's whisker or any other measure you care to use.
1562;Jalepeno Goodness;If you like snacks that are a healthier alternative to other options, almonds are a great way to go.  These particular almonds pack a lot of flavor and kick.
1563;A EASTER GIFT FOR MY DAUGHTER!;Purchased this for my daughter, Gamer Rhi, she loves White Chocolate. It arrived in timely manner as promised.
1564;delicious and nutricious!;I am a mom of 3 kids. My youngest is always on the go as we take her older siblings to their sports practices and games.
1565;Taste is GREAT!!!!;I was sure that there was never a chip that I loved enough to give it 5 stars. But while traveling I bought a bag of these chips ($3.
1566;Beautiful healthy plant;Lovely plant, no brown spots or dead leaves :-)  The only thing that bothers me is that it is all growing to one side, and trying to move leaves over to balance the plant is not working without risking breakage..
1567;Great Taste.. plus Healthy;well I think the nutritional info is very good..
1568;Nana Banana - a delicious gluten-free treat for kids or adults!;"Let me preface this review by saying that in the gluten-free world, baked goods tend to be a bit on the crumbly side because they are missing the ""glue"" (gluten) that holds them together.  Taking this into consideration, Nana's gluten free cookie bars are one of the tastiest gluten-free treats and one of the only brands sweetened with fruit juice instead of sugar."
1569;I love it, but it's too pricey;My kids and I both love this cereal. It is natural and the company is pretty well trusted for being non-GMO and organic.
1570;Don't like the taste;After making it about halfway through a box of 36 of these pods, I feel qualified in saying I do not like the flavor.  It tastes burnt.
1571;Great cereal, but . . .;I love my HBOS!  But @ $4 a box it's not a good value.  I bought 3 4-packs at Amazon for $9 ea.
1572;Spots Stew new flavor for the birds.;Turkey, Duck and Pheasant may sound good to you if you are a human but neither of my two dogs like it. (They don't like the wild salmon either.
1573;Excellent;Since using acai supplements the cramps and tightness in my knee and palm disappeared. I started with some other acai juice product at the beginning but nothing could compare to Acai100 100% Acai Berry Jice Pulp Supplement.
1574;Quality Green Tea;This is a really good tasting green tea and good for you. You can't go wrong with this product and service was great.
1575;Better with a simple addition;These are the classic Spicy Korean noodle bowl familiar to everyone in Korea, or anyone who's been there.  By themselves they are good, very spicy, but the addition of a single slice of processed cheese melted in the noodles turn these from good to INSANELY DELICIOUS.
1576;disgusting sour cinnamon;i use lots of cinnamon,but this was terrible,sour tasting,like it was wet or molded.thankfully i was able to get a full refund.
1577;Horrible;This is probably the worst mix drink I have ever had.  First it is too sweat due to too much stevia added.
1578;Floppy loves it;My beagle loves this treat.<br />The texture is like a cookie and is kind of perfect treat to break into pieces, stuff it in a kong toy etc.
1579;Great taste, beautiful crystal!;My wife and I use this everyday in our dinners.  The crystal is a clean white finishing salt and with 33%lower sodium then table salt and 2% of our magnesium and calcium it is super healthy.
1580;Easy, Cheap and Tasty;Using the Betty Crocker Angel Food cake mix is cheap and easy. The mix almost guarantees a 100% success rate of baking a light and tasty cake.
1581;Best dip mix ever!;Simple to make, just add to sour cream, irresistible with potato chips and crackers.  I also add to brisket for great flavor.
1582;Equal to the Senseo pod;I bought these because like the previous reviewer I found the Senseo pods unavailable. Gave them a shot, and very pleased, will definately get these again, they are every bit as good as the Senseo, pod, and I did a side by side test, no significant differance, might even be a little more frothe with the melitta.
1583;My dog loves these!;My dog loves these treats, I typically try to give one a day but with all the other treats she get's often a day or two is missed.  No worry as long as you supplement the desired ingredients for hip/joint in other products or food.
1584;Not so good;After doing numerous googles looking for Chipsters, one of my favorite childhood snacks, some reported that this product was very close to them. I disagree.
1585;Wonderfully Bold;Newman's Own Special Blend is a wonderfully bold coffee with a very rich flavor. A rich coffee aroma proceeds the bold, full, lasting floavor and with no bitter or dry after taste.
1586;The Tasty, Crunchy,  Zing of Fresh Ginger;Gingersnap lovers (like me), will be delighted with these organic, bite-sized cookies which are packed with the flavorful zing of fresh ginger.<br /><br />Each little cookie (about half-dollar size) is a crunchy (VERY crunchy) mouthful of sweet candied ginger, molasses, with a hint of peppery fresh ginger.
1587;Excellent coffee;This is an excellent full body coffee made better by the speed with which I received it.  The price was significantly less than that available elsewhere.
1588;This one at least tastes good.;My daughter had this drink one day after exercising and she really really liked it.  Mind you she loves anything that is Acai so that may have had a bit to do with it but I tend to think she really did enjoy it since she does drink alot of the healthy drinks.
1589;Great gift!;I purchased this as a Christmas gift, and it arrived very quickly and in good condition.  It works really well and seems to be nicely made.
1590;Great Product;This product was sold in great condition, shipped as ordered and received as ordered. I will purchase this product again.
1591;Coffee;We grind our coffee every morning and it's great to reuse the K-Cups. Saves us money and we have what we like to drink.
1592;More Science Diet on Prime Please;As a frequent Amazon shopper, I purchase nearly everything for my household on Amazon.  I use Amazon Mom & Subscribe and Save almost everyday.
1593;Love these;I love all the V8 Fusion flavors. It's so great to find them in cans.
1594;Outstanding Coffee;Coffee is very much like wine as it is very much a question of preference.  This is by far my favorite coffee.
1595;Quick Recovery!;I ordered Monin Lemon Grass Syrup for a recipe I was making for a party, and I was in a crunch. I definitely needed the product on a specific date, so I ordered well in advance.
1596;Good flavor & strength;I like the Jamaica Me Crazy better, but when it's out of stock, this is my second choice.<br /><br />It's got a nice flavor & strength, without being bitter.
1597;way too weak for my tastes;What can i say, I love iced tea. I drink a lot of it, and love the convenience of these new individual serving size packets.
1598;Great for rootbeer;The Red Star Champagne yeast is very similar to the Lavin EC-1118 yeast. Both are fast fermenting.
1599;great product;It's a great product--always satisfied!!  Excellent mail service too never a problem. thank you!!<br />Will order this product when needed.
1600;WAY overpriced;1-10 count box is about $9 at Vons..
1601;Great taste the whole family loves;Great taste and does not have the weird chalky after taste that other hot cocoa k-cups have.  I've tasted several and this by far is the better one, but I have to say anything larger than 8oz tastes a bit watered down.
1602;Great taste without the sugar;I can't have sugar, so was very pleased to find these great tasting cookies. Friends I have shared them with were surprised to learn they were sugar free.
1603;Important aid to weight loss;Deb-El dry egg whites are an indispensible part of my plan to lose weight. I use 1 tablespoon in a blender along with skim milk, fruit such as banana, 1 scoop of a dry greens product, and 1 tablespoon of a nut butter.
1604;Good value;My wife loves this tea and drinks it every day.  It is 99% caffeine free and good for your health.
1605;still adapting;Using it to sweeten beverages and as substitute for honey in recipes. I prefer honey, but this is more cost effective (at least from AMZ).
1606;Yum!;I loved kettle chips from the moment I tried them but I felt absolutely disgusting every time I had the Kettle Brand. Though very tasty and crunchy, they were also very oily.
1607;What happened to Emeril's?;I have to agree with Dr. Pete's review below.
1608;Jovial Organic  brown rice  capellini;Love the jovial products they are the best of all the dried  pasta I have tried.  My favorite is the fusille simple because I like a thin spagetti.
1609;Delicious!;Since I love figs, these were just great.  Slightly nutty flavor to the cookie dough (since whole wheat) and the fig paste tasted like dense, flavorful figs.
1610;Great quality salt;"This salt is nicely packed and is of good quality. It's a sulphuric salt and lends an ""eggy"" taste to dishes"
1611;Icing Atop Crunchy Ring;It's icing, hard icing, atop a crunchy, sugary, flat cookie ring. It comes in assortment of colours, but they all taste the same.
1612;Not that smashed at all!;"<span class=""tiny""> Length:: 0:17 Mins<br /><br /></span>I was worried I would receive a bag of powdered bonito, instead of shaved bonito.<br /><br />When the box arrived -- apparently delivered by Ace Ventura (from the first movie -- it was *trashed*) -- I feared for the worst."
1613;Delicious Chocolate;I have given these as gifts and have had them myself.  They are delicious and just the right size to pop in your mouth and savor as they melt.
1614;Amazing;I am amazed at this product.  I didn't really expect it to be as good as it is.
1615;Good but outrageously high price;This drink tastes good and helped me to fall asleep easier for the two nights I tried. However, the price is way too high to make it worthwhile.
1616;Tibetian Goji Berries;Did not have enough experience yet to confirm health benefits of the berrries. Eating berries 1 to three tea spoons daily do not seem to have any side affects.
1617;Perfect gift for anyone on a gluten free diet;I purchased this as a gift.  It arrived very fast and looked great.
1618;wow  really;So the hottest-hot-off-the-press recommendation is an ounce of almonds a day will help keep the doctor away..
1619;Not like most anti-dandruff shampoos;This is a really good product.  Has a nice smell and the consistence is good -- not too thick and not runny.
1620;Pretzels everyone likes to eat!;These gluten free pretzels are enjoyed by everyone.  Friends have even said they taste better than their regular pretzels.
1621;My favorite Starbucks blend!;I have tried all the Via blends, and my favorite by far is still Starbucks Tribute.  It was so sad when they ran out last year.
1622;"NOT ""Lighty Sweetened""";"To be fair I prefer my coffee without sugar, but was not terribly concerned with a ""lightly sweetened"" product.  However, as previous reviews mention, this is 3/4 sugar and is sickly sweet."
1623;Delicious!;These are a delicious, low-carb alternative to buttered popcorn. As opposed to the usual semi-spherical shape of other Just-the-cheese products, these are more globular puffs of cheese.
1624;good earth tea;I just love this tea. My brother-in-law came over one day and brought some along.
1625;Geat Product;My son loves the Best Earth's baby food and his favorite seems to be the Vegetable and Turkey. He smiles at every mouthful.
1626;Doggie Crack;Both of my dogs love these antlers and they are much cheaper than other antlers available through amazon.  My doggies love that they can easily get to the marrow, but perhaps because of this, these don't last as other antlers.
1627;Our picky GSD mix loves this food!;"We have a German Shepherd mix who we call ""Snooty McSnooterson"" because of her picky eating habits.  When we adopted her, we started her out on Chicken Soup dry dog food, but it was always a chore to get her to eat it, and she had ongoing issues with loose stools."
1628;get what you pay for;Very earthy and blah. If you use extra sugar in cappuccino it is fine.
1629;A great option for vertical sprouting;These smaller sized Sprout Master sprouters are great for smaller batches of leafy sprouts or bean sprouts. The optional tray dividers makes it easy to make small batches of as many as six different sprouts at a time.
1630;Great for Training my Puppy;I have a German shorthaired pointer puppy who is very difficult to walk.  These treats have been very helpful.
1631;Robust decaf;This is my favoite K-cup decaf coffee.  It rivals caffeinated brands and I don't feel like I am missing anything.
1632;tastes great;the dried blue berry are a little chewy but they taste great. I add them to my Special K in the morning.
1633;I like the taste;For me the tea has light taste, I drink it once a day for about 2 months, hoping to have better hair and nails (after seeing it on Dr.Oz).
1634;Was not item presented on the web site!;I ordered what was pictured on the web site, Fruit Schnecken. The item that arrived was Fruit and Cola Schnecken, which is not what I wanted or would have ordered if given the option.
1635;Best of the iced coffees;I love CoolBrew coffee -- it's the best for making your own iced coffee at home.  The past few summers, I can't live without my CoolBrew, milk, ice and Splenda.
1636;Gourmet powerful Salt & Vinegar chips!;"Kettle brand chips are very crunchy.  I would say regular plain old Lays potato chips are at the ""soft"" end of the ""soft/crunchy"" spectrum."
1637;cannied cherries;My candied cherries arrived promptly and in excellent condition.  They will be used to make my special fruit cake in the middle of the year.
1638;Good buy, but to each their own.;I bought this once and it really helped me and got my energy up. So I bought it again and I just got sick of it.
1639;Chocolate coffee beans - heaven!;This is the only form of coffee that I like.  Once I started to eat expresso beans, I became addicted to them.
1640;Tasty, not entirely unhealthy, VERY sweet;"Not that I would expect something called ""Fudge Drizzle Caramel Popcorn"" not to be sweet, but seriously, the first ingredient is brown sugar -- that's right, there is more brown sugar than popcorn in this!  The next three ingredients are popcorn, sugar, and corn syrup, so three out of the top four ingredients are sugars.  Also, 2."
1641;Meat order via Amazon;I ordered these city ham shanks, the large package size, and when they arrived, I was really surprised that they<br />had little fat, they are mostly ham that is edible and cooks wonderfully with out a lot of fat grease left.<br /><br />I have used it for beans, cabbage, greens, and am really going to say only this to those of you who read this<br />review, you can not beat the quality of the ham shanks, and the price for the large size order, is fantastic.
1642;my son loves this stuff....;he's all grown up now but not too old to have outgrown his childhood favorite - Nutella. I sent him this five pack and between the good price I caught this at and the Prime/free shipping this is a nice anytime gift to send to someone that is a fan of the flavor.
1643;YUM, YUM, YUM TERRIFIC;Great flavor and plenty of it! It's like eating chocolates: They are so rich in lime flavor you can only eat 2 or 3 at a time. The bite size morsels are perfect, lots of flavor and great cookie tastes blended together well.
1644;I also LOVE this stuff!!!!;I also LOVE this stuff!!!<br /><br />Unfortunately, I believe Nestle's has stopped making it.<br /><br />I actually wrote them TWO letters.
1645;One Happy Dog;This is the only dog treat that my Cocker Spaniel enjoys.  My local vendor does not do a good job keeping this item in stock so I was very happy to be able to buy a case of them so that my four legged friend will have the treats she deserves.
1646;Great, but lactose intolerant beware.;This is a very tasty protein shake and give you a nice burst of energy from the caffeine.  Unfortunately I wasn't very careful in reading the ingredients before I purchased, and didn't realize there was so much milk in it.
1647;Not sweet enough or strong enough;I knew the white hot chocolate by Timothy's was not going to be perfect because I have not found any k cup products to be as strong as I would like. However, because of the low price I thought I would try it anyway (it's a lot better than paying $2.
1648;Go Green!;I love my Senseo coffee! The pods are made of a mesh that will decompose. I love that the only thing I have to was is my coffee cup.
1649;Tasty!;This is just another in a long line of terrific yogi teas. I usually keep a teapot full of this tea and add it to my (orange juice based) smoothie in the morning - it adds a nice hint of mint.
1650;Flyboy Cessna;I had a hard time finding the tea I had purchased in the past at my local market.  They had stopped carring the flavor of tea I like eventhough they still carried Stash Tea products.
1651;Sensibly Packaged Smoked Salmon;Delivery was very prompt.  Given as a gift to a salmon-lover who was thrilled to receive it, and pleased that it can be enjoyed a little at a time, because of the small-portion packaging.
1652;Trident Xtra Care;This Gum is the best! Long lasting! Recommended by my Cosmetic Dentist to build Tooth Enamal. Shipped fast! Love it.
1653;Not delicious;I bought a 2 x 10 oz. pack from [.
1654;i like it so far;the freshness date on my box of 2000 sweet mate packets was october 2014. right away i noticed that it comes out of the packet so much easier than most i have tried so far.
1655;Stale Chips;Item came promptly however the crisps were 3 months past their freshness date. Was told I would get replacements.
1656;BBQ larvettes;This product was selected to illustrate alternative food sources to an AP environmental science class at our high school.  The kids were amazed how really good they were after they got over their original repulsion! haha.
1657;Can't say enough good things!;This cocoanut oil has become a staple in our kitchen for all of our cooking oil or butter needs needs. It is great for frying, spread on toast and adding to many recipes calling for butter.
1658;needs salt;I think these would be a lot better with a lot more salt, but I did not find them to be a satisfactory snack by themselves.  I'll finish the package I have with a dip, spread, or cheese.
1659;Gu Not Gross;Does what it needs to do. I've tried other brands that taste disgusting and this one actually tastes like candy.
1660;My favorite olive oil;Everyone's tastes are different. But this is my absolute favorite olive oil.
1661;Navitas Raw Cacao Powder;This is a great product I use in place of cocoa for EVERYTHING!  Makes great smoothies, cocoa, baked goods, etc., but of course, I use it RAW in smoothies and raw recipes as much as possible.
1662;Yummy!;"These cookies are so tasty.  I got the peanut butter creme to try and I will be buying them again!  The cookies are relatively thin since they aren't a ""sandwich"" cookie."
1663;yabba dabba doo;You guys make a great product, I especially like the margarita flavored mix. It goes great with Florida key weekends, boating, and bar-b-q on the beach.
1664;Great for cooking!;White miso is my favorite
1665;Subscribe & Save Up'ed Price!!!;Coffee itself was good enough but after ordering on the subscribe and save, I just got notification that my next delivery would be shipping soon. The price was raised and I got no other notification of that fact.
1666;Stay AWAY!;I like the idea of a chemical-free cleanser (especially if it smells good). But it didn't.
1667;To your health!;I know these berries are the ultimate food for your health. I am just a little disappointed that they don't taste so good by themselves,  like a little snack by themselves.
1668;Best Feel Good Drink on  the Market;Best feel good drink Plus the nutrition is EXCELLENT==Try it NOW==  More Engery=Mental Alertness=Staying Power=NO CRASH and BURN effect. Thank you VIVE==My mouth is just a going to all I talk too, about VIVE.
1669;good business;"I have a cafe and this product moves very quickly.  People really like the brand, ""Twinings""."
1670;yummy;love these and they are a little difficult to find..
1671;If I Could Give it a Higher Review, I Would!;We LOVE gnocchi! We discovered it many years ago, and are always on the look out for it at restaurants.  The brand we used to purchase, we could no longer find, so I turned to trusty Amazon.
1672;Where is Diet MD Code Red;This was absolutely the best tasting diet soda on the market. It was like having a sumptious dessert.
1673;Sweet - Very, Very Sweet;Kellogg's Crunchy Nut cereal doesn't come packaged as a kids' breakfast item, but it sure was a hit with the under-10 crowd in my house.  One bowl revealed the reason why:  it bears a striking resemblance to Frosted Flakes.
1674;Great cereal!;I love this cereal with the high fiber and good taste. The only change I could request would be to lower the price.
1675;Do not miss the salt!;Someone brought these to a party we had last month and I didn't put them out because the buffet was full and didn't think anyone would like saltless potato chips.  Last week we had some friends over and these were all I had in the pantry so I put them out.
1676;Best Bread;This bread mix is wonderful.  Makes the greatest bread, pizza dough, foccacia and more.
1677;I've made more cat friends than I can count!!!!!;"Didn't believe it was ""THE most potent"" catnip out there. WOW, I'm now convinced."
1678;SUPERIOR to a lame jar;I first tried sprouting with a jar with a drain lid. It was hard to drain the water all the way out, it was a pain to rinse the seeds, and my sprouts would rot, before they even sprouted.
1679;Great item!;If your cat(s) are like mine and like a variety each day, then this pack is the ticket.  I spend WAY too much time in the pet food aisles selecting the correct amounts of each kind so just buying these cubes makes life tons easier.
1680;Great Pita Chips;I started buying these chips at the grocery but they became so hard to find that I was delighted to find that Amazon carried them.  These Pita chips are very tasty and fit into a South Beach Diet nicely.
1681;Good flavor;Although this vanilla powder is not as powerful flavor-wise as I'd expected, I can't complain. It's great for those times when extract isn't practical.
1682;oats;Ido not see much differant than regular oats.little longer to cook.
1683;good stuff;This olive oil is very tasty to me.  It is a good bread dipping oil.
1684;I Like It!;I'm having a cup of this coffee as I am writing this review. It was the deal most of all that made me buy this Tully's blend.
1685;Thick and creamy, YUM!;I recently moved to the country where I can no longer get fresh coconuts to open and make my own coconut milk.  Most canned coconut milks you find out there have sugar added (among other things).
1686;Larabar Jocolat Bar;I have always enjoyed this product, but unfortunately, the boxes that I received from Amazon in April,though the expiration date was November,2011,were dry, seemed stale and were inedible. Very disppointing.
1687;Spicy but lacks a good flavor;"I was very interested in trying this since about once a week I made hard tacos, soft tacos, or a taco salad.<br /><br />As another reviewer stated I received my bottle in October and the bottle stated ""Best if used by 30SEP2011""."
1688;Great Halloween treats;These peanut packets were the perfect size to give out at Halloween and a wonderful alternative to sugar treats.<br /><br />This is going to become a tradition.
1689;Flavorful coffee;I ordered this coffee looking for something flavored and seasonal, I had no idea what vanilla nut pumpkin pie would be like together but it is very good. The coffee is good on its own and decent with creamer, I drink my coffee black usually so when I do use creamer it is flavored and in non-flavored coffee.
1690;How nice it is!;It is a pleasure to order a six-pack of Senseo coffee pods from Amazon!  We have owned a couple of Phillips coffee makers and have used Senseo pods for years. So many times when I try to buy them at our local grocery stores, they are out of stock or the price is just too high.
1691;This food turns my cat into a wet vac;My cat inhales this food, he absolutely loves it.  In addition, because he licks the bowl clean there is never any bits of food left that has to be scraped off the plate.
1692;Moldy on arrival;I received these flossies and they were full of mold and definitely not suitable for consumption.  There was a recall by the manufacturer some time ago and flossies are hard to get a hold of.
1693;The best thing that ever happened to fish;This product is really good on all fish, even canned tuna.  Try it with canned tuna or salmon and mayo.
1694;Great coffee;great coffee,  Love the coffee maker and the coffee..
1695;Fantastic;"I sent this collection of Italian cheeses to my daughter and needless to say she was delighted. They were excellent!! <a href=""http://www."
1696;Coffee is great but box was crushed...;I have ordered from this vendor before so was surprised to see that the k cup box was crushed this time.  It may be the shipper that was at fault though since they were in a sturdy box with adequate packaging.
1697;Issue with Amazon and Price;This is a great product
1698;Science Diet = terrible for cats, it's addictive;My kitten--now a hefty 11 pound slug--went through the same antics as the 1-star review written about Bean.<br /><br />I couldn't figure out why our Tiki was always hungry.
1699;Best oat meal on the market;I've eaten oat meal just about everyday for the last 5 years and this brand is the best I've tasted. I normally eat Quaker Oats because it's more economical, but I'll buy a can of McCann's once a year because it's so good.
1700;simply superb;Gave this as a gift to a dear friend who can't tolerate caffeine, a real coffee lover who had always gone out of his way to buy and serve delicious rich and high roasted coffees.  He reports this coffee is as good as any fresh roasted coffee.
1701;Terrific Flavor Enhancer;Like other reviewers have said, the stuff adds a theater-taste to your home popcorn. Grat stuff.
1702;Are you insane;I guess it's good some people can still amaze me. How many 7 pound bags are you selling for $80 some dollars it's a joke right.
1703;Good treats;My dog doesn't like most treats, but loves these.  She gives them 4 paws up!<br /><br />The product arrived quickly and saved me a half-hour drive to a pet store.
1704;Not quite strong enough;I gave this product only three stars simply because the coffee was not quite strong enough for my taste.  My usual morning coffee consists of a stronger brew, and this particular product did not give me a strong enough coffee.
1705;A bean above-outstanding;I am a long time Starbucks standard roast guy.  I have really enjoyed the it's dark richness.
1706;best tea ever;I've been a tea-lover for 30 plus years. some teas are too bitter, or strong, but this tea is so smooth and silky, even without adding a sweetener.
1707;Love it because it doesn't take like Green Tea;"I'm doing the ""Eat right for your type"" diet and the one beverage that benefits me is Green Tea.  We all know that you can go to any store and find a slew of different products in this category, but after reading in a major men's publication that this was the healthiest green tea sold, I had to try it."
1708;This is the one !;My little beasts love this stuff. I have tried this, turkey, and salmon.
1709;Red Clover Tea;I purchased this tea because it is recommended for helping women's PMS symptoms and menopause symptoms.  I've only had one cup of it, so I can't say if it has helped my symptoms or not.
1710;You want it to be great, but it just isn't;I've had many harissas and often have made my own.  While this isn't the worst I've had (that stuff in the yellow tube is), it just doesn't have the robust flavor of a true harissa.
1711;Wonderful;This is a wonderful product. I have a good taste for food and always thought negatively about products like this which is almost instantaneous.
1712;little treats for little dogs;I have 2 small chiwienees who love these.  I've tried many different kinds for them and this is their favorite.
1713;Bring These Back;"<a href=""http://www.amazon."
1714;More Crunchy than Nutty;"This is sweeter honey coated version of Kelloggs Cornflakes,  It was more sweet than nutty,  you get very little nutty taste, it is overwhemled by the honey coating.  It would be great if it had more nuts since it will help increase the ""Crunchy"" texture."
1715;Incredible;OMG, what a treat.  Just received a selection of Lindt Lindor Truffles as a gift, now I'm looking to buy more.
1716;Organic Jelly Beans;Not the same as an old fashioned jelly bean, but good for an organic.  Wish they could come up with a black organic jelly bean and enlarge the size of the bean.
1717;excellent tasting snack;bought these as an add-on --  they are much better than expected. will be reordering if available.
1718;Helps slow breast milk production;Used this to help slow breast milk production when I was breastfeeding.  Worked well!  I drank 3 cups a day.
1719;Makes Good Tuna Salad;My first thought was that the Taco Bell sauce would be good as a dip.  Since my garden is now producing cucumbers at a scary rate, I tried the sauce as a cucumber salad dressing as soon as I opened the bottle.
1720;Last of the liquid Sweet n' Low;If you prefer powdered Sweet n' Low, you have no problem. Over the last year, liquid Sweet n' Low has disappeared from grocery shelves to be replaced with several other brands.
1721;Pork Chomps are the BEST;My dog absolutely loves her mini twist pork chomps.  They are the ultimate treat.
1722;Heavenly!;These are the best Fruit and Nut bars I have ever had.  They have the perfect amount of fruits, nuts, and grain to create a graceful burst of (not to sweet and not to salty) flavour that stimulates your taste buds.
1723;Flowers for Mother's Day from Amazon;I thought I would try to get flowers from Amazon, since I have had so many problems with 1-800 Flowers in the past.  Well, last week, I say that only 1-3 day shipping was available to select on the site.
1724;Please, Sir, May I Have Some More?;This is an excellent value, a smooth, exceptional taste for a great price.  Unlike so many other American coffees, Costa Rican is both distinctive for a lack of bitter aftertaste and a full flavor.
1725;Unsweetened banana chips;I purchased 2 pkgs of these unsweetened banana chips. I really thought they would be similar to other banana chips that are sweetened.
1726;Best corn pasta;My local grocery chain carries this product and the other boxed brand in select stores. The boxed brand is easily overcooked, where Mrs.
1727;words cant describe;how delicious this snack is, i dont really eat salt much, i hate too much pepper also but this is something worth trying.<br /><br />only thing that sucks is the price (i saw 2 7oz bags for like 18 bux on amazon), not sure how much the 1.
1728;Loving It!;I'm loving this tea. The product was shipped quickly.
1729;SUCRALOSE!  P-tooie!;This may not have sugar, but it tastes very strongly of SUCRALOSE, the chlorocarbon substitute marketed as Splenda.<br /><br />If you can tolerate Splenda, then you might like this.
1730;Great...while it lasts...;I own a bread machine and use honey for my whole wheat loaves.  This product works great for a few weeks, but then something happens to the honey.
1731;ok;Not great, but ok 'may' buy it again.  it also may be I have not found the right things to use it with.
1732;Great. Who would pay $6.99 plus shipping for something that costs less than 50 cents?;Great cheap soda. Worth every penny of the $.
1733;Too sweet;This is too sweet for my preference. I love chai, but to me it tastes like milk with sugar and few spices.
1734;I love this line!;After reviewing the anti-dandruff shampoo, I purchased the conditioner, and decided to also try this shampoo. I have been very pleased with all of them.
1735;Earl Grey Cream Tea;Our recent purchase of Earl Grey Cream Tea was a very positve experience. My wife is from China and thinks the tea is the best she has ever had.
1736;OK for decaf;It is OK, if you are in a hurry for a cup of decaf but I won't rave about it.  I bought it for my decaf drinking friends and family.
1737;Tea loving daughter visited England, loved this tea.;This is the best tea in the U.S.
1738;Very Mildly Infused;This is a pleasant coffee, just be aware that it only very mildly infused in my opinion.<br /><br />Coffee is a very personal thing, some like strong bold flavors, deep roasts and powerful flavor notes.
1739;great soup base, quick lunch;these are a step up from the quick noodles you find at the local (anglo) grocer.  i keep several at the office for emergency at-the-desk lunches, and gave a box to my elderly mother who uses for simple, quick meals
1740;Yorkshire Gold - a great six-pack;"This is a robust, rich English style tea worthy of the ""gold"" rating.  The price in the six-pack configuration is very good."
1741;Love Jasmine;I've been drinking jasmine tea for over 20 years. But it usually can't be found in a grocery store.
1742;Going for the Gold of Flavor;Over the years, I've tried a variety of limited edition Pop-Tarts: ones for Star Wars, ones for Spider-Man, ones for The Simpsons, etc. In honor of Team USA and their competitions in the 2012 Olympics, Kellog's has issued these 2012 TEAM USE OLYMPIA LIMITED EDITION POP-TARTS.
1743;Fantastic chips! The best ever!;Seriously the best tortilla chips - or chips of any kind I have ever had.  Plus they have the added benefit of being nutritious.
1744;Not really worth the price;This product had a picture of a full case when I made my purchase. It states that the original price is $58.
1745;Smelly Kid!;My son, age 2, loves this line of products from Gerber. The only bad thing about this particular product is that he REEKS of maple syrup the day after having these for snack (no more than 1/2 cup size serving).
1746;Bisphenol-A Free;Not only are these beans the best tasting canned beans, they are the only ones I've found that us a BPA-Free can.  They are more expensive, but they do seem to have more beans and less water than others.
1747;The best coffee!;This coffee is excellent! I've tried other expensive brands of Mexican Altura and this is equivalent to or better than the more expensive. Great flavor and aroma.
1748;crisp, refreshing but not too tart;I usually find the citrus sodas too tart/acidic for my tastes, and I find the black cherry Fresca too cloyingly sweet. I LOVE the peach
1749;nuts to you;These are as good as ever. Both my son,my wife and I just love them.
1750;Our Girls' Favorite Treat by Far;Our Portuguese Water Dogs, Onda and Lilly, love these treats. They get lots of goodies, but they love the chicken poppers best.
1751;embarrassing;Got a wellness dog treat before which the dogs absolutely loved. Then i bought this dog food.
1752;Amazon;Product was a Christmas gift.  Order for Land O Lakes cocoa mix quickly filled and delivered.
1753;Healthy and nice snack size for my children.;My children like the cherry and apple the best.  I like the strawberry and cherry, but all of them taste great compared to other brands.
1754;YUCK!;I got this noodle I was so excited to try them but after I ate two bite going to sink and nasty after taste so awful smell too..
1755;Stale;This must have been sitting in a warehouse forever, because two of the boxes were almost inedible. I won't be purchasing these again via amazon.
1756;Best energy drink on the planet, shipping is crazy;I remember driving to lan centers and purchasing Bawls energy drink on a consistent basis in order to stay up and game longer. I love this product, the taste is basically a light citrus taste.
1757;A great snack choice!!;I just bought these for the first time. WOW! They are wonderful--not at all  something that simulates  pretzel taste.
1758;Head Rush Frozen Hot Chocolate;If you were to imagine drinking hot chocolate in an ice storm, that might be close to the experience of smooth chocolaty bliss merging with ice crystals slipping through a straw and melting onto your tongue.<br /><br />Ingredients: Sugar, non-fat dry milk, dextrose and cocoas processed with alkali.
1759;Peter;Apparently the seller, atoz4less2012, does this a lot. I received 2 bags of ground coffee and 1 bag of whole bean, all well past their sell-by date.
1760;NOT  %100 organic.... Per the box, they are %70 organic.;The crackers are OK.  I am looking (note present tense) for a graham cracker that is organic, and these taste fair but the big ding comes from them not being %100 organic
1761;They kept their promise!;We were promised 35 different coffee pods and that is what they delivered. It was a wonderful blend of coffees, decafs, tea, hot chocolate, flavored coffees.
1762;Great but better before caramel was added;This candy was amazing growing up. After they added the caramel it was still good but I would cut the caramel off the top so I could get back a bit of old flavor that was in the candy.
1763;good value;This product was a very good value.  I got it for under $10.
1764;Love the 100 calorie packs;I love the 100 calorie packs. They limit my intake so I don't eat a huge bag.
1765;Great in smoothies;I've just started using this in smoothies.  I have been put off by the texture and flavor of many protein powders, but this one is great.
1766;A new favorite for my family;Our family is a big fan of the Naturally Nora cake mixes, and so we waited eagerly for the new brownie mixes.  Bottom line: they are a big hit with our family (which includes two kids)!  The Doubly Fudgy is moist but not heavy.
1767;Best tasting, most nutritious RTD out there;In order for me to get the nutrition I need, I have to supplement with protein and vitamins.  The taste of most powders mixed into water turn my stomach, so when I'm on the go, I turn to ready to drink (RTD) shakes.
1768;Good sardine choice;I've tried many brands of sardines. These are my favorite.
1769;Dude, this stuff Effin' Rocks!;Being Healthy and caring about the type of stuff you eat doesn't mean you have to be boring. My wife and I have been paying too much for this in our local grocery store (big chain)and I was extremely happy to see it picked up my Amazon.
1770;great item;Bought these to give out as party favors for my son's baseball themed birthday party.  They were a huge hit with both the adults and children.
1771;It's Great;Maybe I'm crazy, but I totally disagree with the other review.  I think this tea is delicious.
1772;Great Coffee;Despite the name, Gloria Jeans Mudslide tastes great. One of my favorite K-Cup flavors.
1773;Do not order this product....;It has been over three weeks and I still have not received this product.  And, they have charged me for it already.
1774;Smell like diesel to me;I've been getting these berries for years.  The second to the last bag I had I noticed had a foul odor - very strong, very chemical, not at all appealing.
1775;Awesome;I am very happy with this product. Awesome taste.
1776;Now thats some good coffee. Two thumbs up !;I have been so called a hazelnut coffee freak for about 10 years and I have to say that I finaly found the match to the hazelnut coffee my father in law offered me whenever I was over visiting. He has passed away so I can not say if it was from Coffee Bean Direct.
1777;So happy to be able to purchase a favorite at Amazon;I have been enjoying this cappuccino mix for years.  Sam's club used to sell it then they switched to Sam's Choice Brand which doesn't even compare.
1778;too many chemicals/dyes;I like the nutrium 10 aspect of this conditioner and the bottle it comes in, but they add too many chemicals to it for me to feel safe using it.  It leaves my scalp feeling irritated and I don't like the smell.
1779;Marley coffee;This has a very mild flavor to it and no bitter after taste. If you want it stronger you can just let the bag steep longer.
1780;WisSkye;We love this product. In fact we use it in preference to similar wheat products.
1781;Good Going In, Bad Coming Out;After losing a dog at the age of 9, we looked into providing our pets with a better quality dog food just in case the Purina Pro Plan they had been eating was even partially responsible for her early death.<br /><br />The Wellness dry foods were one of the brands we tried.
1782;Yum!;This is one of our favorite gluten-free cereals.  It reminds me of Cheerios - crunchy and very lightly sweetened.
1783;AWESOME PRODUCT;This is such a wonderful product.  There is no protein taste at all.
1784;Great stuff;It tastes great and the price better than my local store.  I wanted to reduce my pop intake and have found this fits the bill.
1785;Amazing Taste, Best Chip Ever!;I can't believe how wonderful this chip is! The slightly spicy after taste gives the chip extra punch and flavor. My family and I are offically addicted.
1786;Good to a point;The Gevalia Dark Chocolate Truffle coffee is fairly decent tasting coffee if you load it with sweetener, giving it a mild, smooth flavor. However, if you prefer drinking black coffee without sweeteners or creamers, this is one flavored coffee you'll want to avoid, as it takes on slightly bitter flavoring that otherwise spoils the pleasant aroma.
1787;Wonderful to Eat;I was looking for a recipe for sugar free marshmallows, when I found these already available to order. They arrived quickly and are delicious.
1788;Love this stuff. Hard to find.;I have always loved this large pearl tapioca. It is hard to find and recently the place I usually order it from was out of stock on it.
1789;Finicky Chihuahua's love it;We got some samples from a local pet food store after the spoiled chi's had just about trained us that table food was all that they would eat. They all like this duck/sweet potato dry (with some table scrap meat).
1790;Great pet food!;I ordered this for a friend who has a dog.  Her dog loves it and if you do a little investigating you'll learn that all Halo pet foods are very healthy.
1791;WAY too strong;I put one square in my mouth and it made me want to vomit. I love most of their other products but this was absolutely volatile.
1792;Meh;The taste resembles a smokey cocktail wienie gently glazed in honey wrapped in a beef stick. It didn't taste bad, just not my thing.
1793;These do  the trick!;Great way to limit the amount of dry food your cat eats in one sitting as he/she needs to work to get his/her food out.<br /><br />Plus, it provides a bit of a challenge to them, therefore combatting having a bored kitty - a large problem with indoor cats.
1794;Sumatra is the best pod from Senseo;I've tried all of Senseo's coffee pods and by far the Sumatra blend is the best they have to offer.  DH and I have been drinking this blend since it came out a couple of years ago.
1795;Great value, fast shipping!;Love to use N-M vanilla been paste in creme brulee & homemade ice cream in place of hard to use & expensive vanilla beans. Hard to find where I live so I was pleased to find it here at a great price.
1796;"To The Moon and Back... Welcoming ""Pasta"" back into my meals";I absolutely love these noodles..
1797;Horribly Obnoxious - Same Spices -Same gravy in almost all;Horrible taste. All the packets tastes the same.
1798;Great value for money and tastes better than many other oatmeal.;I have always been a big fan of POST oatmeals.I have tasted many other brands but I keep coming back to it.
1799;They are HUGE;Come one now, who doesn't love huge roasted mellows over a camp fire. They arrived very fast and very fresh.
1800;Made both of my dogs sick!!;I gave each of my two dogs one of these bones after I picked them up grocery shopping on Monday evening. By early tuesday morning one of my dogs was already throwing up (first time on my white bedding, of course) and everything after her first bowel movement of the day was pretty much water.
1801;Used to love it.;I had to come back to edit my review after originally giving this product 5 stars.  Something has gone terribly wrong with this product.
1802;What a tasty chip!;I tried these at random, purchased from a gas station when I wanted a spicy snack. I thought 'really, what do I have to lose?' It took only a few bites before I went looking for how to acquire more.
1803;Feline health is feline wealth;My cat had been diagnosed as diabetic. After freaking out and learning how to home test blood glucose levels, a vet recommended that I switch his diet to all wet food and if possible a grain free (low carb) one.
1804;Great Taste;if you purchase this, your money is well spend . this product from Guyana is perfect and taste better than the 15 yr.
1805;The kids LOVE them (and so does Mom!);In the spirit of helping my children learn that healthier eating DOES NOT necessarily mean no more treats, we got a couple of these on a Buy 1, Get 1 deal at a local store. We packed them for lunches on a few different days as a treat, and they have been requested ever since.
1806;Absolute garbage....  get a clue folks...;Once again , clueless consumers that feed their cats nearly inedible corn, glutens, and by-products, none of which are good for your animals.  Last reviewer thinks they are a good cat mom -  think again.
1807;Excellent coffee.  A Winner!;I was given the opportunity to review this product.  I believe I am  qualified because believe it or not, I not only like coffee, but even more astonishingly, I actually drink coffee all the time.
1808;Really Good!;These jelly beans are a treat. The different flavors are fun and taste wonderful.
1809;great coffee, but not the flavor Im looking for for ca phe sua da;Im not a coffee connoisseur at all and cant tell the difference between harbucks or mcdowels, but I do know the taste of ca phe sua da in socal and have been casually engaged in finding the right blend.  The oft recommended, Cafe du Monde, is definitely not the flavor.
1810;Loved it.;It didn't last too long in my house, no kids, just me. Lol.
1811;FINALLY something that my girls can't chew through in minutes!;We have two dogs that are just over one year old (a Yorkie and a Pomeranian.)  And boy do they like to chew.
1812;Too thin;The description does not describe how thick these bully sticks are but for the price paid I expected a thicker bully stick.  I have bought this brand of chew in the store as singles and that was the size that I was expecting because the price of those is about 3.
1813;Great Doggie Treats;My little pom absolutely loves the Greenies Dental Chews. Amazon provides the bigger pack of 96 at a cheaper price than you can find in stores.
1814;My Preferred Coffee;This is my preferred coffee.  I drink this daily.
1815;Wonderful coffee aroma;This Marley Coffee has a beautiful strong aroma before brewing, like fresh ground beans, I am amazed it smells so good and strong then brews up very mild, almost weak, but that sounds like a negative and that's not what I mean, I drink a lot of coffee and have for years and love a strong brew most the time, this coffee is so mild I can drink it plain. I usually like a splash of cream, or lately a dab of honey.
1816;Cinnamon nom nom noms;These taste exactly like cinnamon toast crunch, but with the nutritional composition of almonds. They're pretty mind blowing.
1817;For the dogs!;I bought a Toy Poodle last summer and found that he was getting really dry/flaky skin.  I was given some no-name food from the breeder and my vet suggested this may be the problem.
1818;Observe Pet Reactions to Greenies;I had good results with this product six months ago.  However, a second purchase that I just opened caused all of my three dogs to vomit within minutes of eating the product.
1819;Love this toy!;"This is my dog's favorite toy.  The rings are edible and not the least bit ""bad"" for him."
1820;best morning tea ever;I made the switch from coffee to tea last year, then the switch from black to green this year, now I'm waffling between this Mojito MInt and the Jasmine tea.  Each have just the right amount of caffeine, and a bright, floral flavor.
1821;Doesn't taste light in calories, but it is.;"Nabisco SnackWell Fudge Drizzled Caramel Popcorn is very tasty.  You'd have no idea that this was a ""light"" or ""diet"" snack, but it is indeed low in calories and relatively low in fat."
1822;Good Caffeine Source;It's a cheap energy boost. The taste isn't great but I can tolerate it for the quick, convenient energy supply.
1823;Did not receive after 9 days;I gave two stars, because I am assuming that the meat deserves 3 or 4 stars. I ordered 8 days before Labor Day.
1824;Great Product;I started using this product about 2 months ago. I was having a lot of joint pain, especially in my knees.
1825;Love it!!!!;It is like an ice milk and not at all like icecream. However, if you are used to eating diet items you will love this.
1826;This is a good hot sauce;I got addicted to heat several years ago and started my extreme heat loving with Mad Dog 357 (350,000 scoville units). That sauce was super hot! Then went to the silver edition (750,000 scoville units).
1827;A beautiful bouquet;2008 was a reasonably good vintage for organic milk, but spring storms in the northeast damaged some of the milk vines lessening the overall flavor.  Still the bouquet of Organic Valley recalls flavors of dark cherry and oakwood.
1828;Almost.;These would be great if they did not contain sulfur dioxode which, among other health concerns,  inhibits vitamin B1. Sticking with Eden's Organic Dried Cherries which are pricier but healthier.
1829;Cats and Dogs Both Liked Them;Several reviewers have downgraded these treats because their cats didn't like them.  While I don't doubt this at all, cats being infamous for being finicky, both of my cats like them.
1830;AWESOME PRODUCT!!!!;This is the best thing ever invented!  I have a 15-year-old Bichon who I have tried everything..
1831;Great For Cats With Food Allergies;I had my cat on one of Hill's Prescription Diets until she had a bad reaction to the food.  The prescription diet she was on used hydrolysed chicken protein to try and fool her system to try and avoid an allergic response.
1832;Great Mix!;This is one of the better pancake mixes.  I mix a half cup of this mix with a half cup of  Pamela's pancake mix, one ripe banana, cinnamon, 1/4 cup of almond meal, plus eggs, oil and milk as called for and the pancakes are amazing.
1833;A little too sweet;The product tastes good, but they're a little heavy on the sweetener.  I feel like I'm eating Lucky Charms.
1834;Delicious Treat;I really like how these aren't factory made breakfast bars.  They actually expire which I think says a lot about the nutritional quality.
1835;Adds flavor for HCG Dieters;This dressing is the best! For those who don't know about Walden Farms, their products are gluten free, calorie free, fat free and sugar free. It is the only dressing you can use when on the HCG diet.
1836;Best Popcorn I've ever had!;ever since I started buying Fireworks popcorn I have wanted to eat popcorn every day. So far, I have tried three flavors: Wisconsin White Birch, Savanna Gold, and Autumn Blaze.
1837;I like thme.;I was afraid to try this flavor but I was surprised, they are pretty good.  I put these in my healthy vending machines and they sell.
1838;Stash Pomegranet Raspberry Green Tea;Delicious!  A very definite treat for the tea lover.  'Will continue to order Stash teas from Amazon.
1839;Tips;1) Price: Should be about $25. Amazon doesn't always stock this themselves, so be careful.
1840;So good. So, so good.;These yummy granola bars do indeed taste like a coconut chocolate macaroon. They have 200 calories and 8 grams of fat per pack, and 8 grams of sugar.
1841;suprisingly tasty;I normally don't care for artificially sweetened drinks of any kind, especially odd flavors like orange but this product is actually quite tasty. The effects can vary.
1842;Really dig these cookies!;I've always loved the taste of figs, but have honestly found most fig cookies to be a bit rich, in particular Fig Newtons.  That's why I was really curious to try this new variation.
1843;A Winner cup of coffee!;Not too strong, not too weak..
1844;Taste good but not quite Thai Spicy;I am an expat living in Thailand so I know a thing or two about Thai spicy. While the jerky I received was moist and flavorful, I would not consider it a true Thai taste profile.
1845;a healthier peanut butter;I have been using Bell Plantation for 3 years and think it is a God send. It works perfectly into the Weight Watchers program giving you all the taste of peanut butter without the caloric cost.
1846;Great Food;I initially thought this was a generic brand of food and of poor quality, due to the label design.  However, it's a Weruva product and is exactly the quality of food I normally purchase (Tiki Cat, Merrick, Natural Balance, Wellness).
1847;Best ever side dish;My whole family LOVES this stuff. I make it with Better than Boullion chicken instead of water and it is so good.
1848;WARNING ---> MADE IN CHINA!;I didn't mind paying the $20+ a bag because my dog loved them. These are so expensive that I didn't look on the bag to see where they were made until ANOTHER recent recall on Chinese dog treats/food that was killing dogs.
1849;Delicious raw macadamias!;Quite often macadamia nuts are salted. These, instead, are raw, natural, with nothing added: just delicious macadamia nuts, as they come out of their shell.
1850;My Dogs Love Em;We've been looking for a vegetarian rawhide for our dogs and this is the best yet. Sure it doesn't last hours, but it gives them a good 10-15 minutes of hardcore chewing.
1851;Pets deserve good food too.;"Why didn't I realize sooner that the animals I love deserve food that is wholesome and nutritious?  I recently switched to a top quality dry cat food which I give to our 3 cats daily, but I supplement that with canned ""wet"" food every 2nd or 3rd day.  The cats have adjusted to this new feeding method and really like their new foods."
1852;The Best!!!;This is the best all around olive oil I have ever tasted! It is full-bodied and so smooth that there is not even a hint of acid, even though it is UNFILTERED. It has a subtle, yet difficult to define, enjoyable taste.
1853;Superiour coffee. Excellent price.;I wouldn't rate this five stars if the rating applied only to the quality of the coffee.  That said, this is a very good coffee and is likely superior to the gourmet coffees that have been sitting on the shelf in a typical supermarket.
1854;Another Good Cheez-IT Cracker;First of all I have to say I have yet to meet a Cheez-It cracker I did not like.<br /><br />The new Mozzarella Cheese flavor is no different.
1855;Yum;If you like wint-o-green lifesavers, and if you don't, why are you here anyway, then this is two big bags of something you like. As an Amazon Prime user, shipping is free, which makes this the cheap way to get your methyl salicylate fix.
1856;Zhena' tea. Best tea!;I drink these teas all the time, but this is the first time I tried the pumpkin and I think I have a new favorite. This is the best price anywhere for these teas too.
1857;Pond water would taste better..;Stale, tastless crap. Dont bother.
1858;Tastes Great;I tried peach tea at a Cracker Barrel near me and loved it.  I found it here at Amazon and bought my 6 pack and have gone thru more than half in less than two months.
1859;Please Don't;Please don't drink this.  I have never been happy with their teas.
1860;I'm a convert;I've never liked teas or coffees. I have no idea where I got this tin of Earl Grey, but one day I decided to crack it open and give hot tea one more chance.
1861;Love the product - question the price;I love the tender bites as do my senior cats (17 & 18 yrs old). But I do question the price, which is a unusual.
1862;Nutrisoda, what have you done?;I discovered Nutrisoda a couple years ago on a cruise to Hawaii.  I was delighted to find it available here on Amazon when I got home.
1863;Taste is obviously subjective;I find it interesting when I see a wide range of comments for a product, particularly if for a food or drink. Taste is obviously very subjective.
1864;Absolutely Love These;I like to try new things and when I came across the Smart Fries I just had to try.  I was instantly hooked.
1865;THE BEST!!!!!!!;French sardines are so unlike sardines  in the U.S.
1866;EXCELLENT LIMITED INGREDIENT FOODS;I have two cockers, one of which is getting older. She developed blisters and spotting on her usually beautiful coat.
1867;Rich enough to replace coffee, amazing as that sounds!;My husband and I tried this tea because it was on sale locally (4.99 for 80 ct.
1868;Pattid;This house blend is one of the best coffees.  I have tried a wide variety of k-cup coffees and the House Blend is the best.
1869;The best Coconut water I've found on Amazon;Why did Amazon stop stocking this? Now it is some other seller who is charging outrageous shipping. I am very disappointed.
1870;NO REFINED SUGAR;Taste's great and for someone that can not have refined sugar, what a great treat. I take them with me when I travel.
1871;Quaker Soft Baked Banana Nut Bar;I received a sample of the banana nut bars from Influenster's voxbox program. I loved them and went to buy more.
1872;From a picky eater - I love these;I was a little hesitant to try these, especially after reading such mixed reviews although overall they were positive. However, I liked the idea that they are healthier than regular chips and I figured they would be great for school lunches, quick snacks, etc.
1873;Reindeer Pooper Review;This little gem became a big hit with kids and adults a like.  I bought it as a stocking stuffer.
1874;Meat of Ostrich Rules!;Tasty and Satisfying, these ostrich meat protien sticks are a perfect in between meal snack or addition to a protien diet.  The pepper flavor adds something that is missing from the regular flavor variety of these snacks.
1875;Good Quality and Lots of Quantity;This is a lot of nuts, particularly for the price.  I toast them myself and save a bundle over grocery store prices.
1876;Can't live without my Orgain!;I have done MUCH research on different meal replacement shakes and this one hands down stands out from the rest.  The Iced Cafe Mocha flavor is the best!  Over ice, w/ a hint of nutmeg - there is nothing like it.
1877;Dog-approved and seems to work;My dog is very picky about her food, treats, etc.  Other powdered medicines sprinkled on her food she generally refuses to eat.
1878;Nutiva is the best!!;Nutiva is the best, I love the flavor and the benefits. I find I have a lot more energy and can do way more in a day then I used to.
1879;My favorite K-Cup by far;I have been accused of going over-board on some things and my K-Cup obsession has been no different.  I have tried almost every bold K-Cup on the market (really, my kitchen is full of those little boxes).
1880;Keep for ever, taste great, excellent quality;I grew up up in a family that loved mushrooms, so I love using them in my cooking.  Dried mushrooms are convenient because they keep so well!  Porcini's are one of my favorite mushrooms, and JR Mushrooms brand have an excellent quality.
1881;My dog loves these;My dog has food allergies so it's hard to find snacks for her since she can't have biscuits or meaty treats. She loves these!! The are dried so they can be a little tough to chew so they might not be great for older dogs, but my yellow lab loves them (she's about 4 years old).
1882;Mom loved them;I bought these as a birthday gift for my mother, and she loved them. She said they were delicious, and her only dilemma was how not to eat them all at one time.
1883;Contains CHICKEN;Although these are a quality dog treat please be aware that these do contain chicken. I did not see this ingredient listed on the product page.
1884;This cereal is a total lifesaver!;I have very severe food allergies and when I found Erewhon Corn Flakes at Whole Foods 7 years ago I was thrilled to read the label. Two ingredients! Imagine my surprise when I tried them and realized that they also tasted great! This is literally the only cereal I can eat and I don't mind at all.
1885;Not Great, But Much Better Than The Free Coffee at Work;The Starbucks Via has an acceptable flavor, but they all leave an unpleasant grit on the tongue and lack the aroma of a brewed coffee.  If you are a coffee aficionado, Via is not a great experience.
1886;Great Product!;I used to purchase the Stevia Plus product.  However, I found it to sometimes get clumpy and hard in the packets, making it hard to mix in my tea.
1887;one of the best Chai Tea;I ever had. I use to make my own Chai tea and it took hours and was expensive.
1888;Good luck getting your scoby;"I purchased this product which was fulfilled by Amazon.  I have written three notes about the ""invalid"" code I that came with my jar in order to procure the scoby that is part of what I purchased but must be shipped separately."
1889;Great candy;For the little kids that have an imagination this is so funny and the candy is great quality. Excellent delivery on this product.
1890;lime leaves;I live in a small town and you can't buy these in the stores. They are very nice leaves, some smaller, but most very nice sized, excellent for Thai food.
1891;Good Jelly bellys!;The main reason I am reviewing these is just to let everyone know that these are FRESH.<br />I was wondering how fresh they would be in case they were not popular and sat in the warehouse for a long time.
1892;Great GFCF alternative for kids!;These are the best gluten free, casein free sandwich cookies we have tried!  Nice flavor, and the texture is decent, too.  My daughter loves them.
1893;i said a jack links,spicy beef jack links--go beef!;Jack links are my family's favorite! They are great for snacking, lunchbox or anytime. i only wish they had come individually wrap to stay fresher longer.
1894;Not at all what I ordered;Thought I was ordering Light roast of these K-cups.  When I received the box, it said light roast on box.
1895;Totally addicted to these chips!;All of their chips are GREAT, but these pepper ones are my absolute favorite. (In order of preference: pepper, regular, barbecue, vinegar - haven't tried garlic.
1896;Substandard packaging;0 STARS for the packaging.  It was borderline acceptable.
1897;some things don't calm down;Needed a sleep aid, The reviews amazed me so I ordered some.  Brought it back with me from the states to Costa Rica.
1898;ladygolfer;Great product, easy to prepare and tastes great.  Sent some to my daughter for her to try as well, hope she likes it as much as I do.
1899;Best Lunch Ever;When a beautiful young vixen from work offered to buy me lunch, I was elated.  But, at the time, I was unaware she was not willing to spend more than three dollars.
1900;Delicious and high quality;These are one of my dog's favorites.  I think they smell delicious, kind of smoky and meaty.
1901;Not Worth the Price;I'm always looking for a single-use coffee that is strong enough for my taste without using two pods ..
1902;MMMMM....Chocolate....;I order this product about every 2 months, I usually order the Rich Milk Chocolate (pack of 3) 27.7 oz canister.
1903;flavor for mom;my mom was eating less and less after my dad passed.  i got this for her and she eats popcorn every day now.
1904;Tastes great!!;I am not sure why others have given this product low ratings - not sure what they are expecting for canned chicken.  I agree with the high ratings.
1905;Quite disappointing;Lacks the flavor I was hoping for and the price was a bit high for the satisfaction level.  I won't be ordering this again.
1906;My favorite k-cups;I actually stopped using my Keurig coffee machine for several months before finding these tasty SF Bay fog chasers.  Now I'm using my k-machine nearly every day again and loving it.
1907;Good Coffee;I am always looking for ways to buy Fair Trade items and I found this coffee to be an excellent product as well respectful to the environment and to workers.  This was an excellent find.
1908;Good stuff;First off, the ingredients listed on here are not the same as the ingredients listed on the bags I received. The bags state as follows, Organic beef, sea salt, organic sucanat (cane sugar), organic spices, celery juice powder, cane sugar, organic garlic powder.
1909;They're Good, But Not Great;the cookies are dry and crispy like most of these bagged cookies are. i was hoping for more chocolate and peanutbutter taste.
1910;Favorite Treat;My dog loves Zuke's and so do I especially because it's made in the USA.<br />I have the Chicken treats as well but when he smells these he goes crazy for them.
1911;My cats love this stuff!!!;My wife and I recently took in a stray kitten. She's about a month old and we were not sure what to feed her.
1912;Just what we wanted;The Chai Latte for the Keurig Machines is perfect for my wife. She's not fussy about caffeine based refreshments so the Chai Latte hits the spot perfectly for her.
1913;Real Fruit!;This snack is crispy and delicious!  The crispiness had me doubting if it was really just pears or a partial rice snack but just hold it in your mouth for a few seconds and it actually becomes the pear slice which proved to me it is actual pears alone. I shared with many friends and all gave high approval.
1914;My daughter (10 mos old) LOVES them;My baby girl truly does love Plum Organics! She lights up when she sees them and finishes ea packet with a lil help (rolling up the tube to get all of the food). Easy for stroller rides or trips in the car.
1915;Very Satisfied Customer;I was so happy to find the Stevia Packets in bulk.  I know that buying bulk saves me money and in this economy, I need to save money.
1916;great tasting long lasting energy and sickness fighting;i ordered these goji berrys and they came very quick i was afraid that they would have mold on them after reading all the other reviews..
1917;Consistent thickening agent for food preparation.;I have only used for sauces so far but gives a nice consistency.  There is no noticeable taste and I haven't noticed any weeping of water that happens with regular corn starch.
1918;So Tasty!;We love this cereal!  I have to be gluten free so finding a new cereal took some time.  I loved this cereal from the first bite!  The cereal stays crunchy (in a good way) even after you pour the milk in the bowl.
1919;Always Good, & Always Fresh.;This is the fourth time I've ordered this coffee from amazon and I will be ordering more later when I need it. The coffee is at a good price and delivered in a decent amount of tim.
1920;New Snack Find!;One of my favorite new snack finds!  I am trying to lose weight, and trying to eat more protein - so the smaller size is perfect for snacking.  I like almonds and cashews, but I love what Sahale has done to add flavor to them!  This helps me satisfy my sweet tooth (and avoid candy), while adding protein that helps me feel more full.
1921;I can't see that it works.;I bought these because I have a moth problem.  I have some of the professional traps already but thought I might try a more inexpensive route.
1922;Marmite Yum Yum (Vegemite too);I have never been outside the U.S.
1923;Very good, but a little overboard on the salt;I have a Pasadena popcorn machine from The Great Northern Popcorn company, so I though I'd try their pre-measured popcorn packets. Previously, I have used Vogel's pre-measured packs and compared to Vogels, this stuff is a bit saltier.
1924;Sweeter than the other brand;But not TOO sweet. Very enjoyable - I eat it right out of hand.
1925;need gift option;I recently ordered the hawaiian umbrella houseplant for a friend. I really liked the novelty of this particular plant and even though it did not have the option of enclosing a card, I still ordered it because I didn't see it offered through any florists and thought my name would be on the packing slip.
1926;Best dog treat - great for training;We have a 10-month-old boxer and found a trainer to work with us.  The trainer recommended these treats for training because they're small and the dog doesn't have to stop and chew and chew between activities.
1927;Oh so good!;Received item very quickly. I didn't try it until just lately for grilling season.
1928;A clever idea that didn't work.;The smell and taste of the Lickety Stik was an instant success with our dog.<br />But the dispensing ball dosen't move easily, very much of the time,<br />and it's a nuisance for us to keep helping the ball turn for our dog to get this treat.
1929;Beneful;PURINA Beneful Original Dog Food, 15.5-Pound<br />This dog food is what I normally feed my dogs and they do like it.
1930;premium dog food;This is our Shiz-zu's favorite dog food.  He will eat it dry or mixed with canned.
1931;No refrigerated shipping!;I bought these drops in the store and they are excellent. My mistake was ordering more through Amaxon.
1932;Good Coffee - Great Price;"I caught this as a ""Warehouse"" deal. $18."
1933;My Name is Jodi and I am a Senseo Addict;Ok, so my cousin stole his mom's idea for a Xmas gift for me in 2004. I had lived with a bunch of roomies at the time, where drama ensued whenever someone used the wrong coffeemaker.
1934;Bold but a little bitter;Nice and strong but a little bitter. I think I've been spoiled drinking espresso coffees that I expect a similar smoothness that may not be possible in this format.
1935;Tasty Snack, Very satisfying!;These Snacks are SO SO good. They do NOT taste like a healthy snack and are very satisfying.
1936;Tasty but overpriced;This is by far the best K-cup coffee I have tasted. Has a big bold taste with lots of flavor.
1937;So Good...chocolatey and chewy, too...;Yum..
1938;Haribo gummi bears-the best!;These are the best gummi bears to buy! They are fresh and will remain fresh if you place them in an airtight container after you open them. They're a great price and will always be my favorites.
1939;Don't waste your money or your Keurig on this!;"This coffee tastes very flavorful and is not too strong, but I have to say it almost ruined my months' old Keurig Personal Brewer. The coffee is ground so finely that when the K-Cups are punctured by the needles (top and bottom), it gets packed into the needles and also sifts out through the holes made by the needles, going into the coffee cup creating a very nasty ""sludge"" in the bottom of each cup."
1940;Good, not great;I love all Lavazza coffee, especially the espresso in the black can & the Crema e Gusto.  Tierra is slightly more costly, though some proceeds go to a worthy cause, but to me it's not worth in terms of flavor.
1941;A touch of professionalism;Okay, I'll get it out of the way first: Yes, I am a huge fan of Alton Brown, and that's mostly why I bought this.  But still, it's a first rate product for a food lover to have, and it all comes down to access.
1942;Great favored snack bar;Best favored snack bar I have tried.<br />Everyone that tried one liked them - not one bad review.
1943;Happy customer;I've used  Necta Sweet since 1963.  None of the artificial sweeteners that have come along since then work as well for me.
1944;One of my FAVORITE desserts;Wow. The biggest problem with these cookies is that I eat too many.
1945;Great product.;I really liked the taste. It is well priced too.
1946;My cats have never looked better!!;I never used to think that cat food could change a cat's coat like the Nutro food does! It's freakin phenomenal!! The first thing I noticed was my cats hair got so glossy and shiny! It's soooo soft!! And I used to get tuffs of hair all under my kitchen cabinets near the floor due to all the shedding-- with this food?? I HARDLY have as much lose hair around the house that I used too. I went from vacumming 3 canisters full to only 2 canisters of hair weekly.
1947;Feast on your friends from the sea!;These clams are really good, but are sitting a little too much oil.  I usually pour out a little oil before my feast.
1948;Shockingly Good;"You look at the box and think, ""Ehh, it's okay for a Tuesday night dinner."" Then you make it only to find out that the sauce is absolutely delicious, and then you wish that you had purchased a few more boxes."
1949;Arriba! Salsa;We recently moved to the Boston area and couldn't find our favorite salsa at any of the local grocery stores.  We tried other brands but were always left wanting, so we were very glad to find it on Amazon for what seems like a reasonable price.
1950;Not impressed.;I bought this for all my deck containers this year, and I'm not really that impressed with it. The plants look fine, but I have way fewer flowers than I've ever had using regular potting soil.
1951;Great Candy !;My mom Bee has been a licorice lover for many years. Bee is now 96 and will be 97 in November.
1952;Peppadew Sweet Picante Pepper Mustard;I use this mustard every day with sandwiches made from the previous night's dinner.  It is great with chicken, turkey, beef, pork, and salmon!  I use Orowheat Double Fiber Bread, a little Best Foods mayo, lettuce, sliced pickled Peppadew peppers, and Silver Spring Peppadew Mustard Sauce.
1953;Worst smelling treat for dogs;My puppy loves Greenies pillpockets as a regular treat. When I first discovered this, it was at the vet's office and they used the beef flavored ones.
1954;My life is changed!;Bought this for adding flavor, substance, and protein to lunch shakes, and it works just great!  Peanut butter taste, without the fat.  It dissolves easily and is not overpowering.
1955;Great Lemonade;This is great lemonade without the sugar.  We have used it for years and the price on Amazon was the lowest we could find.
1956;Found at Target for less...;We like this product and recommend it. I was hoping to buy it in bulk here on Amazon (48 pack!), but it seems Target still offers it for less.
1957;Love these;These are my favorite of the gluten free pretezels but they are expensive. So I decided to order a case from Amazon.
1958;YUMMMMmmmmmm;This cereal is so tasty and a nice break from the traditional flake stuff. It has a subtle berry flavor (but not a mock flavor one you get tired of), nice walnut pieces, and very balanced in the sweet/tart factor.
1959;Great Conditioner!;My hair is fine and straight. (ok, it's limp) I normally use Aveda products on my hair because of how they add volume and rinse out so well.
1960;Mushroom Salt;My son was delighted to receive this as a gift for Christmas.  Awhile back we were given a gift pack of various salts and this flavor was his favorite.
1961;Grew for me in a week!;"Yes, I read the product information but I decided to take a chance on a faster germination.  I used a 2"" deep pan and put 1"" of Miracle Grow potting soil in the bottom."
1962;Quality?;I love this product normally, but it tasted just a little bit rancid - the expiration date was OK but maybe it was stored improperly. Still edible but a little concerning.
1963;Refreshing!;Stash organic white tea with organic spearmint, organic lemongrass, and organic peppermint has a clean, clear, refreshing mint flavor.  It's my current favorite tea and is a great bedtime drink.
1964;My dog **LOVED** them!;I used to feed my pets a raw diet (now I feed Blue Buffalo Wilderness formula) so I was pleasantly surprised to see a commercial product even MENTIONING raw feeding on the label. The fact that it's made here in the USA is another huge plus in its favor.
1965;mmmmmm.....good;Seems stange that any item this good and tasty would disappear from stock iun the stores.  So glad  to find it on Amazon.
1966;YUM!;Best chai tea in bag form ever! Love that it has Tulsi in it..
1967;Manuka Honey;I can't be without Wedderspoon Manuka Honey.I am always pleased with the product and<br />it is always shipped on time.
1968;POOR QUALITY CONTROL;Three of the traps came with broken tops and no way to easily secure the raps by hanging to a tree or anything.  I had to use my own string to secure the traps.
1969;crunchy and tasty healthy tortilla chip;These were a nice surprise..
1970;My dog loves it as a treat or sprinkled on her food.;These are very good for a dog who is pickie about thier food. If you give them just before eating they seem to want to eat more of the food you use to feed them.
1971;Excellent product!;I paid $7.85 for 4-33+oz.
1972;Nice coffee but a little acid;It's always great to find a special product, and Marley Coffee is just such a find.  The pods are handy, and organic is a good thing as is Fair Trade.
1973;Dangerous;I bought a carton of these popsicles from Costco ( not from this supplier) and they gave my two year old son massive allergies on his face, eyes and body. When we digged deeply into the reasons for this reaction, we saw that they use red-40, yellow 5, yellow 6 and blue 1 dyes in the product.
1974;Grandma Lucy's Chicken Stew Meatballs;My dog can become very fussy for periods of time.<br />I've tried not giving her people foods but occasionally give her eggs, some meat and cheese.
1975;multigrain version does not appeal to either of my twins;My now 1 yr old babies love the rice and oatmeal versions of this cereal, but hate the multigrain version.  Pity that I tried it out<br />as an amzn multipack, guess it will go into my second harvest bin.
1976;Great coffee but the price is a rip off;I've been buying Jet Fuel for over a year and really like it. So, buying the 50 pack seemed to make sense.
1977;Not bad!;Okay, it does smell kind of like cat food. But it is packaged fish, which I think is what cat food is, so I guess that's not a huge surprise.
1978;My wrinkle puppies love them!;They stink, who cares. They're dog treats and the dogs looove them.
1979;Caliente...;..
1980;Always my kids favorite and fresh too;"I have a hard time finding these in my local grocery store.  Creamy Pesto is my 4 and 6 yr olds' preferred/only sauce for pasta so it has been frustrating driving store to store to find it and not having it when the 4 yr old only wants ""green"" noodles for dinner."
1981;It's alright.;This food has a nice sweet flavor which my son enjoys. It is very much a puree, as you'd expect from a 2nd food.
1982;This is not a miracle health cure!;This is not a miracle health cure!<br /><br />I think some people have unrealistic expectations when it comes to products like this. They expect a sachet of powder  to be the basis of their nutrition regimen.
1983;Stoneridge Orchards Whole Dried Blueberries rate;Sorry I could not have rated 10 stars. I feel they taste better than if I picked them myself! I want to purchase more.
1984;Good product!;This is the cutest make-up traveler!  I would have given it 5 stars, but it is smaller than I expected..
1985;Underwhelming Brew;I found this coffee to have a robust flavor, but lacking in the dark roasted richness I had expected.  In addition, the blend trickles through my brewer in fits and starts, unlike the thirty-second brew I can get from other K-cup varieties.
1986;Great formula...packaging could be better;We began using the ProSobee after determining that our little one suffers from formula intolerance (just can't handle cow's milk at all). The ProSobee is wonderful at addressing this problem and the ready to use cans are a life saver!<br /><br />The only issue I had with my order was that 3 of the 6 cans arrived badly dented (not enough padding around them inside the box) and as dented canned goods present risk of botulism poisoning I couldn't use them for my 4-mo-old.
1987;makes everything better;i use these to make pizza, pasta sauce, ratatouille, chili, beef stew and a cooked spicy tomato ranchero sauce for beef/cheese enchiladas. the tomatoes have a great added depth from being roasted.
1988;Works;I live in the tropics where biodegrading happens FAST! These bags worked without biodegrading in my trash can. They fit the can perfectly and actually stay in place unlike my old drawstring bags.
1989;great tea;Just love it ! nothing more nothing less ..
1990;Smells great, but my hair didn't feel clean;Perhaps I have really odd hair texture, but unlike others who have reviewed here, my hair didn't feel clean after using the shampoo. I have very fine, straight as a board hair, that has been colored with a semi-permanent color to hide the grey.
1991;Great ingredients, but cats can be finicky;What I find attractive about this product is that the right combination of protein, fat and fiber for your pet. The ingredients read like a list of actual recognizable foods such as plants and animals that you would actually buy in the supermarket rather than a long list of artificial ingredients you would never use in a recipe.
1992;Decent Instant Coffee Drink;I got a free sample of the Nescafe Memento Caramel Latte through their Facebook page a while ago, and I finally decided to give it a shot this morning.<br /><br />I love caramel lattes, but it takes some time to make them for real at home and buying them at the coffee shop can get pricey, so I'm always on the lookout of a decent instant mix.
1993;Weruva cat food;Excellent cat food that is recognizable as a food. (I find that it looks and smells a lot better than some of the canned stuff that *I* eat.
1994;Great for full-time baby food makers!;So some of the reviews will scare you to death, but let me tell you, this is a GOOD device! As with everything, you have to clean it. It's easy, pour white vinegar in and let it rest overnight.
1995;Ridiculous price for good product;The Weight Maintenance version of Pedigree does a good job of maintaining weight, and my dog is happy with the taste. But the $23+ price tag at Amazon is way overweight -- I bought this size bag at my local Wal-*** last week for $12.
1996;thankfully you can order this one jar at a time;I'm glad you don't have to order twelve jars of this at once because I don't think the elastic in my pants is rated for that kind of thing.<br /><br />This does taste exactly like the cookies, which if you aren't familiar, tastes sort of like if you peeled the crust off a really good cheesecake, then made that into frosting and - voila! - there you have Biscoff Spread.
1997;Simple, natural recipe with big flavor;Great taste.  I especially like the bite-sized pieces that didn't crumble like peanut brittle and make a mess.
1998;Great Flavor;The flavor is just great.  I drink only diet caffeine free soda and this one fits the bill with the flavor.
1999;Great taste and very easy to cook;I cook it with chicken broth or beef broth or just in hot salted buttery water and it is delicious.<br />I just boil the broth/water and pour it into the bowl where I have my couscous, already seasoned with pepper, salt and garlic powder(be careful not to pour too much liquid or it will become like a puree) let it simmer for 5 min and that's it!!<br />Great for last minute meal.
2000;Best box mix cupcakes I have ever eaten!!!;I keep a box of these in my pantry almost all the time. The cupcakes are not heavy.
2001;Nothing special;This is good bread, but not good enough to make me want to order it again.  King Arthur Flour's website sells a whole meal Irish soda bread mix that is my favorite bread of any kind, but the company only sells it around St.
2002;My Dogs Love It;I've been through the research and unending label-checking to find a dog food that I was content feeding them, only to find out that my picky eater would turn her nose up at the food.  The other couldn't care less and literally inhales his food.
2003;excellent dry cat food;I used to use the cheaper grocery store brands. Then two cats got very sick and I had no idea what was causing it.
2004;Seriously Foul Coffee;I'm not picky about coffee. I'll drink just about any dreck that's been sitting in a pot, mug or carafe for a day or two.
2005;took a couple fo days to decide he liked it;Great stuff.  The dog wouldn't touch it at first.
2006;Great value;I was pleased with the quality of the product. The speed in which I received the package was great.
2007;NATURAL VITALITY - NATURAL CALM;"<a href=""http://www.amazon."
2008;Mocha...;not a bad cup of coffee..
2009;Great for toddlers, too!;Our whole family loves this snack. These make a great toddler snack (they're kind of puffy, so if you don't actually chew them, they'll just melt).
2010;zinger flavor;Fantastic bold citrusy flavor.  Not very spicy, but quite savory.
2011;Great Stuff;My dog is an 80 pound lab with epilepsy. A few month ago, he started having seizures again despite his medication.
2012;BEST GLUTEN FREE PASTA. PERIOD.;I first discovered this pasta at the NYC restaurant Nizza (if you're gluten-free, you NEED to check them out!). The first time I had this pasta, I was not on the gluten-free diet but I tried some of my Mom's dish (she has Celiac's).
2013;Another bag of molded Goji berries;I believe this is my first review. I am slightly addicted to Goji berries.
2014;best tea;Great taste along with freshness. Quick shipping and true value.
2015;These soynuts are exactly what I wanted;Roasted, unsalted soy nuts are not the most delicious snack. So before you buy 12, 9 oz packages, you should try a small quantity at your local health food store or asian grocer.
2016;Perfect for College Students;My daughter is away at college and had mentioned that she missed having her Chai tea because she can't store milk at the dorm. Ran across this at the grocery store and figured I would send it.
2017;Poor Packaging;First let me say that the product itself is excellent and I have no problems with it. This review is mainly about Amazon's idea of proper packaging.
2018;Works as the ads say it does...;This product is great and you get what the ads tell you about this product. You can definitely get through hours where you are extremely tired.
2019;Love;My baby started refusing baby food at 9 mos and my 2.5yr old is a picky eater.
2020;"""Medium"" roast???";I recently purchased an 11 oz. bag of whole bean Seattle's Best Level 3 coffee.
2021;I  would purchase this product again;This product is great.  If you are gluten free it is a must have in your house.
2022;I'm addicted;I am hopelessly addicted to these jalape&ntilde
2023;Didn't sit well with my baby;I got a few different flavors of the HAPPYBABY food and this one in particular causes my daughter to gag and vomit. My daughter does not have a weak stomach by any means and eats a lot of different foods.
2024;Good But TOO Pricey;I spend a lot of time making lattes and I've used Starbucks, illy, and Lavazza pods all ordered on Amazon. Right now illy is $.
2025;The best creamer;This is the best non dairy creamer by far.  I have tried most and have become quite pleased with Coffee Mate.
2026;Good Good!;The guys in the receiving area liked it..
2027;Possibly the best tea I've had yet.;This tea is just amazing. It has a very unique taste, and if you like cinnamon at all you will love this.
2028;My Favorite;I love a bold, strong coffee without a bitter taste, and this has proven to be my favorite. Strong and flavorful, even the decaf version is excellent.
2029;Tastes like fruit punch;I've had to cut back on caffeine, and diet soda in general, so I was on a mission to find an alternative. This tropical fruit tea fit all my needs.
2030;Nueske's Smokehouse Bacon.... Seriously good stuff;If you are a bacon head, here is your bait:  Nueske's cherrywood or applewood smoked bacon.  Pricey?  Yes.
2031;Great coffee, but Pricy!;I was looking for a replacement for the Millstone subscripiton I had since Amazon canceled it.<br />This is a very good tasting coffee for a pod machine, however
2032;My cat likes the taste;My cat is 13 years old.  I had been feeding her Friskies Dental Diet for most of her adult life, but it was discontinued.
2033;Buyer beware....;The shipping was shabby. The gumballs were in a plastic bag that was stapled.
2034;Dog really likes, but they go fast.;I have an 11 pound Couton De Tulear.  Small sharp teeth.
2035;Lifesaver!!;I got a tip from a friend about ginger helping with motion sickness and tummy troubles so one weekend at my in laws (father in law is the worst driver ever and I get sick to the point of almost vomitting every time I ride in a car with him) I grabbed a box of these at a health food store..
2036;Well made, but only for the very food motivated;I bought the Tug Jug for my dog because she was jealous of the cat's Slim Kitty food dispenser and she likes to play with rope toys.  I guess jealousy and rope are not enough motivation for her to play with it.
2037;really really expensive;We have two large dogs and are always looking for high quality treats.  The dogs really liked these chews, but there are only four in a pack when you purchase the large size.
2038;BioBags are the best;These bags are great.  They are super easy to open up and I've never had to worry about tearing.
2039;Great Taste-Tricky procedure;"These pork skins have a great taste. Very fresh ""homemade"" taste."
2040;my throat is better;These cough drops are great. My grandparents have used them most of thier life but could they help me too? Yes My throat was better quick.
2041;Refreshing;We went to a well known restaurant that was serving raspberry pink lemonade, it was refreshing. The waitress told us that it was a sugar-free raspberry syrup added with sugar pink lemonade.
2042;Greenies Pill Pockets;I first got these at my Vet's when my dog got ill and I didnt know how I would get the pill down her throat..
2043;Rich and Delectable;I love this brand since discovering it 6-7 years ago, and I have hooked my father on this cranberries & almond bar, and raspberry bar. A little goes a long way, and the slightly tart-sweet cranberries and crunchy almonds bring out the rich dark chocolate flavor, and are a delicious complement.
2044;Finicky cats;I have four cats and they all like this food.  Since there is only one serving per can, it would be a better buy for a one cat family.
2045;Strongest k-cup I have tried;This coffee is so strong, I found it bitter.  I even tried diluting it by brewing larger sizes, but I still found it bitter.
2046;I didn't like it;I have been looking for a good, organic tea but I just did not like the taste of this one.  It feels like it leaves a film in your mouth.
2047;F L A V O R.....O K....E X C E P T....I N....C O F F E E;NIDO INSTANT DRY WHOLE MILK POWDER seemed the answer to the prayers of anyone with a too-small-for-their-needs-refrigerator-and-who-can't-afford-to-presently-purchase-a-new-refrigerator -- like me.  I've tried non-fat dry milk to save room in my refrigerator --but the taste is AWFUL!  I've tried to substitute sweetened condensed milk, (too sweet), and 1/2 and 1/2, (which needs refrigeration -- but not that much room in the refrigerator.
2048;Excellent blend but contains SUGAR;I tried this at a mall
2049;My Morning Drink;I like that Zipfizz isn't full of a bunch of crap.  It gets me out of my morning funk, and makes me start drinking water early.
2050;Hamburger Topper !;I really thought this would be hot but it wasn't.  It has a thick, creamy consistency with the slightest tang  - very smooth flavor and would compliment a variety of foods.
2051;Perfect!;This is the perfect storage unit for my K-cups!  It fits perfectly next to my coffee maker.  I love the fact it stores up to 54 cups too.
2052;Using It For Years;I've been using Sugar Twin Spoonable for many years. I was very happy to fine the large box at a reasonable price.
2053;Very Good;This is a very good product.  My little dog realy enjoys it and he bounces around like a puppy with all his new found energy (He is over 4 years old).
2054;RELIEF AFTER ALL THESE YEARS!!!;Most people don't even want to talk about this TABU subject and view it mostly as an 'Old Folks' malady
2055;OMG;Now I know what evil tastes like! I literally had to plug my nose to choke this stuff down, and I eat really healthy on a regular basis. I'll continue to drink it until it's gone because I paid for it, and the only way something that tastes this bad could really have a benefit is because it probably is good for my body.
2056;My very picky cats love it;I love this brand. I have two very picky cats and they love this! They are both healthy, energetic with glossy coats - very happy with the Goodlife cat food for indoor cats.
2057;Great gum for those avoiding nutrasweet;I can't have any nutrasweet as it triggers migraines. Even gum that is not sugar free has nutrasweet as well as sugar.
2058;Ear Grey decaf tea;Love this product.  The tea is smooth yet hearty which is tough to find in a decaf tea.
2059;very poor service;I ordered this product and had it shipped in one day because I needed it for the weekend for a special event. To my surprise the product turned out to be date molasses instead of grape which will not work.
2060;Great Product!;These are wonderful for our dog's teeth, ingredients are nutritious and she really loves them. It's hard to find products anymore that work and have these kind of ingredients that are actually good for our pets.
2061;CUSTOMER FOR LIFE!!;This sauce is incredible! I ordered both of the different sauces (peanut and satay) because of its all natural healthy ingredients. My boyfriend, (who happens to be thai) was hesitant to try it at first because he says he can never find a sauce that met his standards, UNTIL THIS!! One day I came home from work excited to have it over some fried tofu and vegetables, to find that HE HAD EATEN THE ENTIRE THING!! We are both truly loyal customers now - we absolutely love this sauce, it is great on salads, with meats, vegetables or tofu - it really adds an addictive flavor to any dish.
2062;My cat likes the taste;My cat is 13 years old.  I had been feeding her Friskies Dental Diet for most of her adult life, but it was discontinued.
2063;It's arlight;Well I have been taking this product for a week now. The first time I took it, WOW!!! I had a lot of energy.
2064;My dogs love these things!!!;Our vet friend gave Busy Buddies to my dogs for Christmas.  What a life saver.
2065;Impossible to Find-Thank You for Having These Available;re:  Lifesaver Hawaiian Fruits Hard Candy 6.26 oz.
2066;Very warm and spicy;This is a very strong, spicy cinnamon tea, great for cold days.  However, you do need to really like cinnamon to enjoy this tea.
2067;Great value for an amazing product :);I love belly flops and my 5 year old does too. We play a game every Friday night during movie night on guessing the flavor.
2068;What happened?;Where has this product gone?<br /><br />I can't find any explanation for the sudden disappearance of cinnamon altoids from every place I have looked for them.<br /><br />The company web page still lists them as a current product.
2069;Strong and Bold flavor;When I got to enjoy a cup of Kona on our vacation to Hawaii, I thought I was in Heaven.  The smooth flavor was something to enjoy at any time of day or night.
2070;Happy I bought this product;I have made 6 or so batches of food with this and have really enjoyed doing so.  It's taken just a few hours on two Saturdays to make weeks and weeks worth of food.
2071;very good;flavorful, not too spicey, great consistency - not too runny, no too thick. Really really really good chili.
2072;A staple item;I have been a fan of these protein bars before ordering here. Now, getting them on autoship is just a bonus.
2073;great price;My daughter teaches kindergarten and I help her and the other 6 kindergarten 120 kids do gingerbread houses at Xmas.  Every year we have to buy the small tubes since M&m do does not sell the bags locally.
2074;"Don't know why the word ""Calm"" is on the canister.";I drink this every afternoon with two heaping teaspoons in 16 ounces of water. This does not make me either sleepy nor calm.
2075;Yummy!;I have to disagree with another reviewer
2076;Bigelow Vanilla Cai Tea;I was introduced to this tea at a business convention at a Marriott about 3 years ago.  Loved it, but couldn't find it our local grocery store or Wal-mart.
2077;Best Ever!;My husband and youngest son have a bad habit of eating all the marshmallows from the Lucky Charms Cereal leaving me and my oldest son in the cold (we actually like eating the cereal with the marshmallows).  I found the website to purchase just marshmallows and thought what a great idea and bought a bunch for my husband and son's christmas present.
2078;wrong quantity;"Description states: ""Pack of 4"".  I only received 1 and still paid the advertised price for 4."
2079;Great Natural Taste!;"I've reviewed a lot of these products, and most have some common flaws: Bad, ""unnatural,"" or chemical-like taste (especially in the metallic after-taste), woefully stale, cardboard-like texture, high fat content, and relatively high price.<br /><br />Fortunately, Lara-Bars are perhaps the best tasting line of ""nutritional bars"" available."
2080;WARNING! Made all four of my dogs sick;Recently purchased these treats for my 4 dogs from local grocery store. After giving my dogs these chews, my 3 month old puppy threw up the treat.
2081;Great Gift, Could Use More Tea!;I bought these on the gold box deal for 12.50.
2082;timothy's rainforest extra bold;If you like a good strong cup of coffee,you will love this one .It will get you going.
2083;Get the popped cheese instead!;To avoid the hassle of returning this I decided to make it a treat for our dog - she loves it!  
2084;Black Garlic: Garlic meets sweet  molases flavor;Introducing a simple food with a wonderfully complex flavor. Black garlic is sweet meets savory, a perfect mix of molasses-like richness and tangy garlic undertones.
2085;I love the root beer!!;Really love the root beer.  Also like the ginger ale, but think the root beer is my favorite.
2086;Only waffle mix I use;I first tried this waffle mix staying at a hotel. They had one of those make-your-own waffles and this was the mix that they used.
2087;Excellent decaf;I find this is a perfectly balanced cup and actually, it's really wonderful with neither sugar nor milk, drunk after dinner with a small dessert perhaps (a cookie or biscotti.) The only issue I had with it--it's Columbian coffee and like many of the Central American coffees, it has a lot of acid.
2088;Love These, But Was Sent Old Cookies;"This is my second time ordering the ""bulk"" amount, because these biscuits have no match, and they are hard to find in stores. Packaging was MUCH better this time -- bubble wrapped and double boxed."
2089;Our dog loves this food;Love the item, but found it Cheaper at Vitacost.com.
2090;Best low-glycemic sweetener on the market!;This is the BEST low-glycemic sweetener on the market, and I've tried many brands of it and this is the most wonderful, with very little imprint on what you drink.  It leaves coffees and herbal teas tasting like coffees and herbal teas!  I sure hope they get this back soon as I'm rapidly running out and don't want to try to hunt it down over the net from anyone else.
2091;Made in Michigan since 1866;"I like ""Vernor's"", and drink it all the time. It is old fashioned drink from Michigan, since 1866, and the labeling was known for its lovely green and gold colors and the gnome character."
2092;Rich and dark;Flavorful rich dark coffee.  This is great high quality coffee that makes a great cup of coffee time after time.
2093;Great on the go snack;This is a great price for the perfect pick me up snack. Kids love it.
2094;Very solid bold coffee;I order this item consistently for my office. Everyone here seems to enjoy the flavor of this coffee.
2095;Good starter;"I am new to the ""coffee pod"" world. I recently bought a Hamilton Beach dual coffee pot (single and carafe service) and I read the coffee pods were a good option."
2096;My baby liked it;My little one liked this and would eat it up without any issues. It does have all the vegetables.
2097;My Dressing;"I call this product ""my dressing.""  I have loved it since I was very little."
2098;Soda Stream Mix;Great product - it tastes like the real thing!  I would recommend this product to my family and friends.  Great delivery service.
2099;Great product!;Me and my husband love this bar. It is great for hiking or for everyday snacking.
2100;Premium Oolong Tea;Prince of Tea brand teas are great. The premium oolong tea is good, but I found that I like their organic oolong to taste better than the premium, and it generally costs less too.
2101;THE BEST!!!;This is the BEST popcorn in the world!!  I was a white popcorn fan until I tried this a few years ago, purchased from Scheels Sporting Goods.  After I found this on Amazon though I buy this and it lasts me 3-4 months.
2102;My finicky cat will not eat this food;Having seen the TV adds for Blue Buffalo pet foods I was very optimistic to try this for my adult cat.  She is very finicky, preferring canned shredded meat to dry food though she will nibble on food like some major brand Cat Chow during the day.
2103;Tull's Italian roast;"This too is excellant as a tall iced-coffee.<a href=""http://www."
2104;Beyond stale;As a kid i absolutely loved the green frogs and when i saw these on sale i jumped on the deal.  Much to my disappointment i am not able to actually taste these because they are so stale.
2105;Campfire;These taste terrible. The Smoked Cheddar are unbearable to eat because they taste like you are eating a campfire.
2106;Way too good for breakfast;My kid loves this stuff.  Not only do you get the awesome crunch but the hint of brown sugar makes you feel like you're eating something very naughty.
2107;Review;I'll stick with plain or spinach. Did like that it was fettuccine instead of angel hair.
2108;Tastes great!;I love these granola bars!  Even though the gluten free market is growing, it is still not always easy to find things that taste good. This brand is really good.
2109;Nice tea blend;This definitely will appeal to those who enjoy a vanilla spice flavor to their tea.  I tried not to steep mine for too long (the package says 4-6 minutes), but the flavors were still there and pleasant enough.
2110;Not for Me;Our neighborhood always have a pot luck picnic each year on Labor Day.  Everyone always look forward to my cakes and I always look forward to baking them for all to enjoy.
2111;Sparkling Scents;"""4"" and ""flavor"" are misleading. They all tasted exactly the same: like nothing."
2112;Effective;I can't say anything about the silver ions technology, although I know it IS being used in underwear and outerwear for active people, so I'm sure there's some truth in its efficacy in stopping odor.<br /><br />Degree for Men Deodorant With Silver Ion Technology, smells good, goes on without feeling sticky and just plain does the job.
2113;Nylabones;I have 6 dogs and they all enjoy these bones.  The last a very long time.
2114;These cause vomiting;We gave Pur Luv Grande Bones to our Golden Doodle and Golden Retriever.  They loved eating them but both vomited up chunks of hard undigested pieces of these bones the next day.
2115;My dog loves this;My dog loves this treat.  She gets two a day.
2116;Kitty cat crack;I got this to give to our cat as an occasional treat. Like many of the reviewers here my cat now acts like an addict.
2117;Poor Texture;These have the texture of old almonds. They are soft and chewy, and do not have the crunchy bite of fresh almonds.
2118;Blah.  Tasteless.;Very bland.  Tastes like raspberry apricot but not real fruity .
2119;my fav GF breakfast bar!!;I like the apple & just ordered cranberry to try but BLUEBERRY is very tasty!!!<br /><br />GF eating has been a hard ---hard on the taste buds---lifestyle change for us, but these bars really help!<br /><br />My picky toddler even eats them!<br /><br />He likes these better than the apple.<br /><br />I prefer the blueberry too.
2120;Best gluten-free pasta we've tried;"We are in the early stages of gluten-free living, and we've tried many gluten-free ""pastas."" This is by far the best."
2121;Great food for a picky eater or those with digestive issues!;Our Himalayan cat is an extremely picky eater.  To add to this she has intestinal trouble with many foods (diarrhea, vomiting).
2122;Love these soups!;Again, having lived in Japan for several years learning to love this product, I am thrilled it is avalable in The States and on line as well. I have a cup every day!<br /><br />Eva C.
2123;Great gf option;This crust makes an awesome bbq chicken pizza. It's even better on the grill (green egg grill).
2124;ahi tuna;"on the whole a great snack food that is very ""moreish""  (i.e i want more!)<br />."
2125;Great beans!;I have purchased Lavazza grounds before and they are great. I wanted to see if the beans tasted any better and they do, plus they're a lot cheaper when bought in bulk like this! If you like your espresso, definitely consider this purchase.
2126;Love this tea;The delicous aroma is apparant the minute I opened the box.  The tea bag itself is a unique triangular shape.
2127;Awesome in a bottle;I've been drinking Ribena ever since I was a kid. It has a unique taste that keeps you wanting more.
2128;Not 11 packets, but only one and it is damn good;When I purchased this product I thought I was getting 11 packets since quantity said 11 and picture had 6 packets in them. The 11 is actually the number of biscuits inside the packet.
2129;Wonderful;Ahh, It is always great to get the great taste of an England biscuits with my daily cup of PG Tips. Living in America for 20+ years, these moments bring back memories of old.
2130;Raspberry Tea is the BEST;I love raspberries and this tea does not disappoint.  Herbal teas meet our water needs and why not with some favorite flavor.
2131;Do NOT Order This!;You are not getting 5 of the bonus packs (which should consist of 10 individual packs = total 50 individual packs)
2132;Great price if you love summer sausage;If you love summer sausage and are looking for it other than during the holidays. This is a great price and tastes really good too.
2133;People love these;These are great bags and i get asked about them all the time in the grocery store. I know the ad says equivalent to 2 plastic bags but i've had 5 half gallons of milk in one of them!  I recently had a few of their 'too-cute' line that i bought off their website at a community event (penguins, strawberry's, puppies) and it was amazing how many people came up to my booth asking about them.
2134;not what i hoped;This stuff, is awfull,tried brewing it different ways, either to weak, or to bitter. I DO NOT LIKE IT AT ALL.
2135;A Good Thing.;Great coffee.<br /><br />Convenient packaging.
2136;Uncle Ben Cornbread Dressing;This product is the best dressing!  I wish they would sell it in the stores. It would put the other box dressings to shame.
2137;I must be allergic;I've never had an allergic reaction to any food, or anything else, in my life.  But within 20 seconds of starting to chew a piece of this gum, my throat began to burn and my airway became constricted.
2138;Multi-purpose salt that also works on popcorn.;Not as well as Morton's or especially not as well as Flavacol, but it does work.<br /><br />This is a fairly versatile salt that can be used for any number of things, not<br />just popcorn or nuts.
2139;ok but not 5 star;I've been hunting for a good oolong tea like I used to get in Hong Kong! Haven't found it yet. Tried this one and it was just ok not what I had hoped for.
2140;Miracle (slime) noodle;Gross, I could not get past the smell and texture.  The noodle comes in some type of water and smells like an old fish market.
2141;A Good B17 Source;These don't taste especially good, but not bad, either.  After reading A World Without Cancer, by G.
2142;Great Tea @ Reasonable Price;I have a hard time finding nettle leaf tea at regular grocery stores, so I purchased mine from Amazon.  I generally enjoy English Breakfast, Earl Grey, Japanese green, and Oolong teas
2143;childhood favorite;My husband used to eat these when he was a boy in Indiana. So I ordered them and he loves them.
2144;Big Easy Bold - that really is!;I love my Keurig.  I've tried many of their suggested coffees, and keep coming back to this one.
2145;Love this oil;I pop corn at least once a week and this oil is the best. I have always used peanut oil and it works great but i like the way this oil makes the corn yellow.
2146;terrific;I love this tea.  It's refreshing especially in the hot summer.
2147;Perfect!!;These are roasted, but that is what I wanted. A perfect replacement for  Kroger brand unsalted cashews!!<br />Locally for me, they aren't always in stock and never on sale.
2148;What a great alternative to peanut M&M's;I received these as a gift for Christmas at work, they were in a little zip-loc back in a tiny cardboard box. It looked very cute.
2149;Hormel  white/dark turkey  5 oz. can in water;The chunk white/dark  turkey was purchased for my college daughter. It is great for students to add to pasta or make a spread for a sandwich.
2150;My husband loves this Kcup!;My husband is the big coffee drinker around this house and he's the one that ordered these specific ones. He absolutely loves them and has them all the time even though we have many other flavors.
2151;Yum!;These bars are so good! I was really surprised. They are even better if you take their suggestion and heat them up in the microwave.
2152;Delicious, but wait until fall...;These bars were delicious. The nuts were great, the honey flavor came through, and the dark chocolate was spot on.
2153;a great deal and a good brew;I must say that I bought this for two reasons. One, because the price was right and second, because it had CHOCOLATE.
2154;An all natural remedy that actually works!;A  nursing mothers dream come true.  I saw an increase in volume within a few days.
2155;weird combination;let me first say that we are a family of 6 and nugo bars addicts.  you will find at least 7-8 boxes of different flavors in our household on any given day.
2156;Nifty storage for coffee pods.;"I saw this product advertised and found it on Amazon.  It truly is ""nifty""!  Coffee pods are kept neatly and easy to select in this handy drawer."
2157;Great tea!;I'd been drinking Twinings Earl Grey for years, then someone gave me some of this tea.  I brewed a cup, took a sip and did NOT like it.
2158;good service, good coffee;Product arrived earlier than expected, in good condition.  This large quantity had the best price per cup available, even though it's a lot more than I usually buy.
2159;Odd texture...didn't win my cats over;This product was made in a wafer form that had to be broken up for my animals to eat. When they first smelled it, they came running, but after a couple of bites, they turned their noses up at it.
2160;Convient for everyday use and emergencies;I'm a vegetarian who takes protein basically wherever I can get it. Most pre-mixed soy varieties you find in the grocery store, other than silk, don't agree with me.
2161;Finally an organic snack alternative for my kids!;I know that the Happy Family rice cakes say 7+ months, but I wanted my kids (ages 3 and 2 years old) to try them.  They immediately loved munching on them in between meals and on long rides in the car.
2162;tastes like egg;These are the best glutin free ritz-like crackers..
2163;My Favorite Tea Brand;There are lots of tea companies however this one is my clear favorite. Unlike other natural tea companies this brand actually taste good and uses unbleached tea bags.
2164;Easy to Use and Less Sugar;When I first found this product I was hesitant..
2165;licorice allsorts 5 pound bag;Licorice came quickly, sooner than arrival date, but quality was poor. I thought Bassetts would be best brand but it wasn't.
2166;Fabulous;I buy a lot of nuts, but I only repurchase those that are fresh & flavorful.  Emerald Nuts Deluxe Mixed nuts are fabulous.
2167;HEAVEN S SENT;WE HAVE 5 DOGS.  THREE ARE SPECIAL NEEDS DOGS WE ADOPTED.
2168;Quick;A decent lunch.  High sodium limits eating them everyday.
2169;Melatonin;I love this stuff, knocks me out when I need good sleep. but be careful of excessive use of melatonin.
2170;I forgot how much I LOVE oatmeal!;I loved everything about this oatmeal. It is fast and easy to prepare, just add hot water or milk.
2171;Very Healthy!;We have a dog with a liver shunt - so she can't have a lot of protein / can't digest protein.  Booda Bones are the BEST treat for her (and our other dog loves them as well!).
2172;Do not expect to be able to rotate this. It is only good for emergencies.;I didn't really have very high expectations when buying this item but was disappointed nonetheless. The food is only going o be edible in a survival scenario.
2173;Huge Rip Off!;Wow! I've been buying dog treats for over 40 years and this one takes the cake! Pay no attention to the photo in the advertisement for this product. What you get is two (2) small chews in each of three (3) shrink wrapped over cardboard packages.
2174;Delicious;This coffee is delicious and organic. It is full bodied with a fruity chocolate after taste that lingers in the mouth.
2175;Saving Money;I ordered 4 bottles of joop so i could get free ups shipping.They were short one bottle but did not penalize me and i still received free ups and i do appreciate that.
2176;not a good flavor in my opinion.;I dislike this flavor. I will try a different flavor though, as I think this cracker may be very good.
2177;Product is ok as far as coconut water goes, but bottle designs suck!;Coconut water tastes ok as far as bottled coconut water goes. The real thing is what I have grown up on, so I have to settle.
2178;Is this a joke? If I could give it a 0, I would.;First of all, I am aware that this is made for the gun, however after reading the reviews I purchased it and let me say I have never been more dissapointed. In the picture the gold is brilliant, bold, and intense.
2179;Cats love it;After one of my cats experienced some tummy problems, I decided to look for some grain free options.  My cats love this stuff.
2180;weird feeling;I started taking this product about a week ago. Well for starters, I feel like I'm pregnant!!! I have this horrible taste in my mouth, its all wet nasty tasting & wet! I have to keep gum or candy in my mouth.
2181;Best bread so far;This is the only gluten free bread that I have found that taste good. The first couple of times I made it in the bread machine but never turned out.
2182;When it comes to pets...we owners will try everything...;..
2183;Pure Bliss!;I just happened to stumble upon this product from a fitness blog I had been reading.  So on a whim I ordered it.
2184;Easy to prepare;"This dish was extremely easy to prepare, but the film lid stuck to the sauce compartment, which sits loosely inside the main compartment, so I almost burned my fingers. Taste-and-texture-wise it was fine (compared to other ready meals) but the sauce was not spicy, at least not in the ""caliente"" sense."
2185;Great if Packaged Correctly - Awesome Energy Drink;Have been getting this for a while and when local stores had trouble getting it, I turned to Amazon.<br />With Prime shipping, this is a great deal and an awesome product.
2186;Great snack;I love the portability and taste of this snack. I wish the caloric and sodium count was less, But the protein count is perfect.
2187;Wierd Tasting;They were distributing these bottles at a station, and i happened to get of them. Just one sip and it i immediately regreted taking this bottle.
2188;Very Good!!;First off, the original delivery date was about a month and a half after purchase date. So you can imagine my surprise just a week later when these arrived!<br /><br />The taste seems a little different then before, but I havn't had these in almost a decade so the memory isn't 100% clear.
2189;Milk!;I've relied in this the whole time I wad breastfeeding my baby for 7 months. I was able to pump 4 times a day with 5-6oz per pumping because of fenugreek.
2190;TERRIBLE;This does not have any chunks at all! It's like mush. I'm giving my case to my friend to see if her daughters cat will eat it, but I doubt it.
2191;Another great healthy snack;"I love to snack and with these you truly feel that you must be ""cheating"" somehow!  The flavors are delicious and the variety is great so that you don't get too tired of any one flavor. Have this set up for ""routine delivery"" every 4 months, with the Popchips I get and the Tortilla Popchips I'm set for healthy snacks and they all come at different times so I never have too many at any given time."
2192;Pretty good;I was glsd to be able to eat black licorice again.  This product has a fairly strong flavor so a little goes a long way.
2193;THE BEST THERE IS!;This is, by far, the best pb made. I can only get the 'creamy' honey roasted by Skippy where I live.
2194;Smooth & Tangle Free;I was skeptical about this product since I have tried most of them and they all just leave my hair looking and feeling oily no matter how little I use. However with this one I applied a dime size, rubbed both hands together, and applied to my damp but brushed out hair (just the back length) and after it dried it was only smooth and shiny and not oily! This is very comparable to and the price is a lot less than my favorite Bain de Terre Recovery Complex Anti-Frizz Silky Shine Serum.
2195;Best Chips Bar None;Lundberg Rice Chips are the best chip out there bar none! They are lightly salted with sea salt and have better flavor than any chip I have ever tasted. Crunchy crisp texture.
2196;A required taste........somewhat;I bought this thing it was smooth like butter, but its has a bit of crunch to it and pretty oily too. But it taste okay if you are a fan of peanut butter, which I am.
2197;Stevia Extract;I use stevia extract every day instead of sugar. This product is dependable.
2198;Great supplement;I noticed that my dog was occasionally lifting it's hind leg when running around. I did some research and many websites advised to give glucosamine treats with fish oil to help heal the joints.
2199;Among the three best coffees for the Keurig brewer line;This is one of the very best strong coffees available for the Keurig brewers.  It picks up up, slams you down, then picks you up yet again!.
2200;not the best;Both my kids love these. I think the Glutino GFCF ones are better, but if you are avoiding soy, these are good.
2201;Well it was worth a shot;Sadly, this is pretty crummy tea. For decent Orange Pekoe, I remain sold on Typhoo.
2202;My Morning Choice;Helps me get my morning started.  Convenient, tasty and the aroma is wonderful.
2203;1000 times better than normal;this is an incredibly good soda, and is well worth the money. one thing i noticed that was odd is the cap says its bottled by temple bottling co.
2204;Awesome Stuff;This is a great product.  My whole family (including my 20 month old) loves it!  This coconut water is not as sweet as some of the others I have tried.
2205;Tasty;This tea has lots of flavors.  I first started loving Chai tea about 8 years ago.
2206;Not appetizing to any of the senses;Fixed according to directions and served to a panel of 3 people.  0/3 liked it.
2207;Helped lower my cholesterol without side effects;Statins caused me muscle pain, joint cramping and headaches.  My cholesterol was 244 and my doctor said I needed to get it down.
2208;baby food that's right;This NurturMe All-Natural Baby Food actually resembles the taste of fresh peas, and not just a little bit either.  I'd say the taste is STRONGLY reminiscent of fresh garden peas.
2209;SO happy I liked it!;I am fighting cancer, and I decided to do a vegan diet. With no animal protein, and mostly vegetables it was super hard to get enough protein.
2210;just okay;I just thought I'd give these a try being all natural with such a short list of ingredients. Basically they are just okay.
2211;"Nice ""tea overview""";Variety received but distribution among the varieties included is not consistent
2212;Every single can dented;I read the reviews and was hoping that the ones who received dented cans were just a fluke.  I got my box and EVERY can was dented.
2213;Finicky Cat food;I have tried at least 30 different brands/flavors of cat food for my 4 year old cat who has suddenly become<br />picky.  This is the only flavor in the only brand he will eat.
2214;Upset;"I purchased this because on the picture of the soup it says ""Old Fashion"" chicken noodle, where the noodles are thick and flat, this is what I wanted and I got just regular chicken noodles with the rotini noodles. I haven't been able to find the ""old fashioned"" kind in my grocery stores so when I saw the picture of this one, this is why I ordered it and it is not it."
2215;Displeased.;About half of the sticks were opened and had to be thrown away. All candy was stale.
2216;Delicious Tea;I love this tea. It is delicious.
2217;Delivery cancelled, no comments;I ordered a box of chocolate from the seller, and asked them to ship to Canada. I am not sure why the seller finally canceled the order after 2 weeks.
2218;Great hard treats, but too big for a puppy;My puppy really likes these treats and they've been great with training, there are just two things I would mention that I didn't think about before purchasing: 1. These treats are big for a puppy so we cut each one in half 2.
2219;FANTASTIC DEAL;TOTALLY AGREE with the two previous reviewers. Have frozen about half of the content, and put the rest in 3 of 4oz jars and kept the two in the regular compartment of the refrigerator and one outside in room temperature.
2220;Why the fillers and guar gum? Sigh;Unfortunately, I can't afford a raw food diet for my cats and they want nothing to do with Felidae, the only affordable truly healthy food that has an ingredients list that makes me feel comfortable. My cats love both turkey formulas of Newman's brand.
2221;excellent stakich honey;this honey is really tasty. not sure if it is organic though, but one of the best tasting raw honeys around.
2222;Product taste was fine, shipping poor;When I received the biscotti it was in crumbs.  It had been returned and reshipped (by mistake, I am sure).
2223;Happy Puppy dogs!;I like having delivered w/free shipping! There are two flavors per shipment. I think Pedigree is a good name and my dogs love it.
2224;I have 6 favorites, this is one of them;This review is going to get posted in 6 places, as I'm indicating my preferences for 6 different coffees. If you like one, maybe you will like the other.
2225;Reasonable price, contents a little different;As gift baskets go, this one is OK.  The price is reasonable and the contents are a little different than usually seen.
2226;Why is this so marked up?;You can get this tea from the Harney and sons website for 1/3 less than it is listed here..
2227;Pretty good break from other brand granola bars;I got the white chocolate macadamia flavor of these.  They really aren't any different from any other granola bars.
2228;Additive but satisfying in small quantities;I have to put some aside because  my kids and hubby snag em so quick I have to buy a bag and hide it just for me , give them a tryu., I wont let you down, or contact me and I'll buy em off you.
2229;Good, but doesn't taste like strawberries;I have been pretty happy with my other Davidson tea purchases. After having strawberry green tea at a coffee/tea shop I thought I'd give this strawberry black tea a try.
2230;Tastes good, but I wouldn't order during the summer again...got hot!;First off I didn't notice any mediciney smell or taste as some reviewers stated.  No bitterness.
2231;As good as everyone says!;Yep, it's a little more expensive than store-bought tahini.  But it's not in a nasty can, and it doesn't separate like the canned tahini.
2232;Good for moka pot;I've been using this in my moka pot for several months. I also make an occasional pour-over with this coffee.
2233;rubber noodles;had to give 'em a try. sounded too good to be true but I had hope.
2234;Peppermint for sure!;I started using peppermint oil for my sebhorriac dermatitis and someone said to try the tea for digestion and irritable bowel syndrome.  Though I have only used it twice, I have to admit it did help me.
2235;Sweet and crunchy;I bought these in pursuit of a snack I used to eat when I was a kid - that version was softer and more chewy than this which has a crunch to it. 4 thin wafers/bars come in a pack and they make a great sweet snack.
2236;One, two, chai, chai, chai!;The India Spice Chai is delicious!  I usually buy the Chai Latte (which I love), but decided to try the Chai tea.  This is not a creamy drink like the Chai Latte.
2237;Fantastic dry cat food.;About a month ago, I switched my 4 year-old cat, Penelope, from Purina One to Wellness Core.  The difference that the new food has produced in Penelope's energy levels, fur smoothness, and overall mood are more than palpable.
2238;It's a tongue twister.......;"they're pronounced like ""persnickety"" minus the ""per"". Now, that that's out of the way, these little puffy airy balls are just plain cheesy goodness!! A 4."
2239;price went up considerably;I liked the product, but after ordering receiving the second bottle, the price went up considerably.  I hate to find a substitute, but I will.
2240;Needs lot of other spices to complete 'masala';It says add cumin, cinnamon, cardamom, clove ..
2241;Damp & chewy;I purchase Kind bars from my retailer every day and was trying to save a few dollars. These bars arrived in a damaged carton that appeared to have experienced excessive moisture.
2242;Best chips out there;Being a chip lover from way back, these are among the best.  Where so many other baked chips taste like cardboard, these actually taste like a potato.
2243;100% Kona;Great body and flavor Kona coffee. Excellent Kona for the price.
2244;These bubbles scare the kitties - indoor and outdoor;I got a bottle of these bubbles for my brother and his wife, who have two very active indoor kitties. They looked at the bubbles for a few seconds, and soon walked away.
2245;C.E.T.  HEXtra Chews;Our Black Lab has been eating these since we got her 4 years ago.  They are a dental hygiene product and very effective.
2246;Candy in a Box;Tasty but too tasty?  Too much like candy for my purposes.  If you are on a diet you might like these bars too much and find you want more than one.
2247;Thai Red Curry Paste;The product was what I expected and more.  Easy cooking instructions with authentic flavor.
2248;Himself reviews coconut oil;My spouse is in stage three of Alzheimers and has been using prescription medicine for over four years, yet she continues to regress.  Two months is not sufficient time to gauge the effectiveness of the Coconut Oil but it certainly cannot harm her.
2249;Excellent breakfast tea!;I buy all my loose tea from Stash, and Kopili Assam is one of the best Assams I've tasted.  It's a bold, dark red, tea that tastes good any time of day.
2250;dont buy from this company;I would NOT buy from this company again. when the pro treats came they were already expired by over two months.
2251;Healthy Ramen Noodles;I've looked around for soup bowls and similar products that are satisfying, reasonably priced, and not full of preservatives or excess salt.  This seems a good alternative.
2252;stops fecal balls;My eight month old kitty, Jitterbug came to us eating Science Diet and everything was fine.  I slowly switched him over to Purina indoor, which I've always fed my cats and had no problems with.
2253;Senseo Coffee Pods;I love all the Senseo pods I've tried.  The sale price on these pods and the Espresso pods was too good to pass up.
2254;Gourmet dinner for your dog;If you feel like your dog should be fed with carefully prepared gourmet food, try Purina Chef Michael's Grilled Sirloin Steak Flavor food with potato and green been garnishes.  This dog food is designed for adult dogs.
2255;LOVE THESE COOKIES;I love crisp sugar cookies, these were perfect, tasted like regular gluten cookies.  Will buy over and over.
2256;Good salt substitute;I bought this recently and it's pretty good compared to other salt substitutes available at the grocery store. This has more flavor than seasoning blends by Mrs Dash (which contain too much black pepper) and the store brands.
2257;Why do you have MSG?;I really wanted to buy these but for some unhealthly reason MSG was used in the ingredients.  I'll be watching for the no MSG label on your future packaging.
2258;never again.!!;i order these for my baby shower and unfortunately  i had to buy it again from another store because out of 80 sticks only 23 came out nice and unbroken. had to pay double the price it sucks.
2259;Love these fruit twists;Organic, soft, and chewy.  Perfect snack at a much better price than in stores.
2260;Great source of protein..;These are a great source of protein and healthy alternative to potato chips. Will buy again.
2261;Not offensive, but not much to recommend it.;The sweetness is most prominent in this flavor, and the most out-of-place as well. There was, disappointingly, no heat that I could detect.
2262;A great veggie option.;I have two toddlers who are not always willing to eat fresh vegetables. HappyBaby is a great and tasty way for them to get their veggies and fruits.
2263;Fruit;Seller is AAA+++ received fruit in good shape exactly what I ordered.<br />Very Happy,<br /><br />I will be ordering again.
2264;Nice then SICK!!;At first it tastes like strawberries and cream then BAM it tastes like NASTY!!! Sick. It's like the taste of old in your mouth.
2265;Makes a great dough!;I am the mom of a 5 year old celiac, so it is very important to be able to make cut out sugar cookies and have them be decent. I have tried MANY gluten-free sugar cookie doughs.
2266;Gourmet Salts,;I bought this collection for a friend for Christmas. He LOVED it - I think he tasted every one and passed out tastes right then and there.
2267;Every Can Was Dented - Product Was OK;"Package arrived today and both the outer (Amazon) and inner (product) boxes were completely undamaged but every can inside was dented -- some very minor and others very misshapen. And the damage ""location"" varies widely, so that means they were damaged BEFORE they were boxed up."
2268;Smells good...;I had high hopes for this, despite knowing from reviews here that it contained a sugar substitute. I love hot cider, and especially caramel cider.
2269;It is good;Love the packaging and perfect if you have more than one child - I give one to my one year old and one to my three year old. Both equally enjoy it.
2270;Barbeque treat creates dog anti- frenzy;I purchased these for my dog and my sisters 2.  They are all large dogs (46 lbs.
2271;my dogs love them;These are great. Not to hard not too soft.
2272;Delicious, relaxing, good for you!;What a delightful mix of tea and spices.  Nothing overwhelming, just a comfortable, tasty, natural set of flavors.
2273;Worth the Price;I've tried using other Soy milk powder but the flavor has been really strong.  I haven't found that with Better Than Milk Vegan Soy Powder.
2274;My standard milk aternative.;I have been drinking this brand for as long as it has been available. I enjoyed that I could order the 8oz boxes in bulk as the savings is enormous compared to what I might find locally, plus you can mostly buy vanilla flavor as a three pack, and I just find that too sweet.
2275;Good flavor, not overwhelming;"The chocolate flavor is ""pleasantly present,"" in that it is not overwhelming at all.  I'm a self-confessed chocoholic, so I love the chocolate flavor."
2276;Never again;I read the reviews and took my chances and bought a bunch.  I am so disappointed by the sweet, lacquered Chinese bbq pork like beef jerky with an overwhelmingly raw garlic/chili favor.
2277;My cat's favorite flavor;My cat absolutely loves this flavor. Normally, I have to coax her to finish her food, but when I give her a serving of Chicken & Herring, the bowl is clean in like five minutes.
2278;works well;The pens work well. I used them to draw faces on large pumpkin shaped marshmallows.
2279;Yum;We had never tried red chips before and wasn't sure what we would be getting, we were pleasantly surprised. They have a great flavor and texture.
2280;Best Cookie...So Full of Chocolate;Just got these in today and opened up 2 of the packages to put them in the cookie jar. They were not any broken and they are delicious.
2281;This product is great;I love this product it makes great lemon pepper wings. My mother actually recommended it to me.
2282;Best Sugar Free Cookie~You get 8 as a serving :);It is hard to believe these are sugar free. They are so good.
2283;True Grit;I recently prepared waffles with this product.  The result was gritty like dental polish, and not edible to me or the two people that tried it with me.
2284;Best Paprika;My wife bought me some of this as a surprise gift a couple days ago.  I love cooking and paprika is one of my favorite ingredients.
2285;Son loved this soup;My son approved of this flavor soup.  I thought it was too watery in consistency so I sometimes added a little rice to it.
2286;Best value on an outstanding Assam tea!;If you are a demanding tea totaller as am I, this Assam is a fantastic value. One of the best Assam teas available in the USA - certainly one of the best I've tried - and I've tried many.
2287;Very Convenient;This is one of the flavors that our cat prefers.  Our cat, probably like yours, too, has very evident preferences in her food.
2288;fyi;"""They found that two of the licorice compounds, licoricidin and licorisoflavan A, were the most effective antibacterial substances. These substances killed two of the major bacteria responsible for dental cavities and two of the bacteria that promote gum disease."
2289;Natural calm Magnesium Raspbeery-lemon;I have used this Calm for over two years and is very happy with the product it has help with stress muscle tension and many other thing. I take it very day and when I forget to take it for a day I can see the differant in my body.
2290;YUMMY!;Quite frankly, this is comparable to the Banana Nut Crunch from Post except this is better.  I look forward to the crunchy banana slices and the almonds that are hidden in this granola.
2291;This is the way to buy gummy bears;I didn't know what I was going to do with this many gummi bears.  But I found something--I ate them.
2292;Popchips;Love the Popchips.  Less calories then regular chips, so you can eat more.
2293;Nine Lives Tuna;I probably should have my cats do this as they are the comsumers.  I was glad to see Amazon offer this as it has always been a favorite of my numerous cats and not easy to find in this area.
2294;Filler food is empty, leaves your cat always needing more;This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes.
2295;horrifying;I would love to talk to the people who manufacture this product. It was horrifying when I started eating the dried up mess and a tiny tooth appeared.
2296;How did they taste?;These were ok, I would say they are a harder on the teeth than the Almond Apricot. Maybe a bit over priced.
2297;Best general GF mix ever;I have been GF for 7 years. This mix is by far the best general baking mix that I have found.
2298;Not Outstanding. Light to Medium Roast. Smooth, Not Acidic.;"I love the names Wolfgang Puck gives to their coffees, but the coffee descriptions leave a lot to be desired.<br /><br />In this case, with ""Breakfast in Bed"", I expected a much more flavorful cup of coffee than delivered."
2299;Don't pay this much;This product is wonderful. BUT you shouldn't pay this much.
2300;Does the new almond addition ruin the taste?;I agree with the other review stating that the original version was better. It was.
2301;Yum!;OK..
2302;GOOD STUFF!;I like buying Paul Newman products because the profits go to his camp for ill children.  And they taste good too.
2303;Good product;Nice product for the price. All you have to use is a zip lock bag because they use a screen for the bottom of the cup.
2304;tasty gravy;I have used the Southeastern Mills products for several years and have found them to be easy to make and very tasty.  The product is always consitent out of the package and stays fresh long after bottled or jarred products.
2305;Quite tasty;I don't understand the other reviewers that complain about having to wash the product. Quinoa needs to be washed before cooking.
2306;Cheaper than the vending machine;I realized I was pumping a lot of money into the vending machine in my office to have a bag of chips with my sandwich from home. At less than $0.
2307;Acquired taste;Interesting product--the texture is crunchy, but this flavor is bordering on bitter.  Seems heavily spiced, but the flavor might grow on you.
2308;Tasty and Good for You!;This is the perfect morning perk me up.  The tea brews nicely and has just a hint of jasmine flavors (not overpowering at all).
2309;A Chewy NY Style Foldable Crust!;I really thought good NY style pizza was a thing of my pre gluten free past..
2310;Great with beans;Great rice - smells like popcorn, great with all kinds of beans.  Authentic all the way.
2311;Very Disappointed;I love McCann's regular steel oats cereal but in our busy world, it's nice to be able to have an instant oatmeal when time is short.  Because of all the positive reviews relative McCann's instant oatmeal, I ordered it.
2312;pricey;Items came but were a little old. Pricey was another watchword as I have found where I can buy them for much less.
2313;Sodastream;After years of dealing with increasing price of soda, finding place to store it and returning  empty bottles decided to give this a try. We bought ours at Costco which came with 1-130L Co2 Carbonator, 2 1-Liter Stainless Steel Bottles and trial flavors pack for $99.
2314;Very good;We love our licorice, but spending $10 a pound on average isn't a luxury we often afford ourselves. When finding this HUGE bag of wheels on Amazon we had to give them a try.
2315;Cats like OK;My cats generally are fond of Pro Plan
2316;Tastes good, large servings;1) SERVING SIZE: The amount of oatmeal per packet is almost twice as much as you get from other oatmeal packets like Quaker or Dr. McDougall's.
2317;ADDICTIVE;After years of being addicted to Smart Puffs, as soon as I tried these Sea Salt & Vinegar chips, I was an instant convert.<br /><br />They are light, crispy, and perfectly salty and vinegar-y.
2318;Nice and strong - the way I like it.;I consider myself somewhat of a coffee expert.  I have tried all types and prices of coffee brewed in every type of container (from french presses to drip makers to keurig and pod devices to cappuccino machines).
2319;Much smaller leaves than the picture;The tea has a good flavor, but is too small to use my bombilla (as it keeps getting clogged). I bought this solely based on the picture which made it appear to be decent-sized cuttings.
2320;Picky Eater;At an early age my Beagle (yes, a beagle) was picky about eating.  crushing a little freeze dried chicken liver on his food gave him the incentive to eat.
2321;Relaunching and old favorite;This looks to be a relaunch of the old, and internationally widely available, Honey Nut Corn Flakes.<br /><br />The name alone should tell you most of what you need to know about this cereal as it aptly describes exactly how this cereal tastes.
2322;Worth a try!;3 dogs, 1 loves it and uses it as intended.  The only complaint there is that he's become far too good at it and learned how to push the rope in and out very quickly.
2323;I love it!;This is a great machine.  You can get hot water, make tea from a tea bag or using a k cup, make a whole range of coffees, decafs, even hot chocolate from k cups
2324;natural fraud;kashi is an 'all natural' fraud.  although some of their products are organic, the 'all natural' ones, such as this one, contain GMO's.
2325;Acquired taste;I am an avid coffee drinker and have tried many different types of coffee. I had Turkish coffee many times except my friend always ground her own and I liked the flavor of her coffee.
2326;I love Senseo;Great coffee.  Great taste.
2327;My babies love them!;Oddly enough, I found these at Old Navy. We were leaving and my 1 year old twins were cranky so I bought these hoping they were something they could eat.
2328;Great taste!;I was a little nervous about this product when it was first introduced to me at a support group meeting.  I wasn't sure how any GF product cooked in the microwave could be edible.
2329;Mom loves it;"My mother has loved this particular flavor her entire life.  Every month or so she calls me and asks me to order her some more of this from ""The Amazon""."
2330;Not Worth the Price!;These crackers were expensive for gluten free and when I opened the box they were all in tiny pieces!  If I could have located manufacturer's address or a website, I would have let them know.  Don't waste your money on these.
2331;K cup sample pack;The k cup sample pack contains so many different brews of delicious coffee, cider, hot chocolate, iced coffee, cappacinos, espressos.  There are hardly two cups that are alike.
2332;Yummy!  We got an even mix on 03/28/11.;My daughter loves and I mean LOVES these lollipops.  We ordered the five pound bag the other day through Amazon Prime and we got an even mix of the following flavors (I added a pic to the customer images above):<br /><br />Blueberry<br />Mango<br />Cherry<br />Sour Apple<br />Strawberry<br />Watermelon<br />Pomegranate<br />Grape<br /><br />Hope this helps anyone wondering whether the mixes are even.
2333;Not what was expected;Though it shows 5 different flavors our bag only really had 3. I ate one that had the taste of pine sol.
2334;Use this mix for Chocolate Chip Bars (Blonde Brownies);There is a recipe on the side of the box for Chocolate Chip Brownies.  We call them Blonde Brownies.
2335;nostalgia delicious;I use to buy these as a kid and loved them.  But you never see them anymore.
2336;I'm off the sugar;I waited a little while to write a review on this product. I got it because I love coffee and I knew I was consuming WAY too much sugar from my coffee alone.
2337;Hours of fun!;My dachshund dog, Barney, ABSOLUTEY LOVES THIS TOY.  He loves for us to put dog food kibble in it, and then he entertains himself for hours.
2338;TEN PLUS!!;ABSOLUTELY THE BEST 'NATURAL COCONUT' EVER!!  VERY DIFFICULT TO LOCATE A QUALITY COCONUT PRODUCT BUT THIS IS QUALITY!<br /><br />PACKAGE WELL SEALED  WHICH  ENSURES  GREAT FLAVOR..
2339;"Less ""strong"", but curiously good!";So..
2340;Best meal time slower-downer and doggy activity out there;We bought this for our 5 month old lab to keep her from inhaling her dinner in 5 seconds flat. We have now purchased 2 more as gifts for other dog owners.
2341;Just like I remember from my travels!;Thank you for carrying this product!  I have missed them since I have not traveled lately, and these were a surprise gift for my husband who LOVES them.  The project arrived quickly and undamaged, and we are working hard to control ourselves to make them last.
2342;Larabar Never Fails;This flavor is not my favorite. Cherry is still my favorite.
2343;And it's Gourmet (Organic);It's so easy to shop for my kitty.  I go on line and an entire box of 24 is here as quickly as I<br /><br />would have been able to go to the store.
2344;Coffee grounds in your cup!;Don't waste your money on this product unless you like the coffee grounds in the bottom of your cup.  This brand is the only one with this problem of the many brands of K-cups I have tried.
2345;WARNING: BUGS!!;These contain insect extract. It is not listed on the sellers page, but it is listed on the package.
2346;Best reusable filter for K-Cup yet!;I have the Keurig My K-Cup and found it to be annoying to have to pull out the insert to use it after I use an actual k-cup.  This eliminates that and I've found it to make a better cup of coffee as well.
2347;Rotten!;The only thing good about this product was the container - clever handle built into the screw down top.  The product inside however was rotten.
2348;fiber content is wrong on the label, not 11 but 6!;"A fellow dieter corrected me today and directed me to the Nature's Path website where it says:<br />""March 22,2012 .."
2349;LOVE this oatmeal!  Doesn't taste instant!  DELICIOUS!;Tastes like you just made it from scratch, after only 2 mins in the microwave.  It is nutty, delicious, and nutritious.
2350;Good dog food but...;My australian cattle dog loves just about any brands of dog food.  While I believe Orijen is a good pet food company, he actually developed intense itches while on the Regional Red.
2351;Warning: Completely Addictive! :);I have a problem with the diet swiss miss hot chocolate. I eat a box or 2 of them daily-- I seriously need to cut back.
2352;A Great Refreshing Drink;This is a great drink and is a shame it has been discontinued by Nestles.  I have always enjoyed the taste and it is always refreshing to drink.
2353;ok - but in small portions only;I completely liked these things --- BEFORE I got the gigantic 5lb bag. I'd actually prefer to keep them as a treat rather than something to just get sick of.
2354;Great vegan tacos!!!;These tacos are great. Highly recommend for all vegetarians.
2355;Crunchy Oats;Fans of hearty oat cereals should enjoy Quaker Cinnamon Oatmeal Squares. If you've had the regular Oatmeal Squares, then just imagine them with sweet, rich cinnamon added.
2356;As good as ever. . .;This is indeed a good grind for a Bialetti stovetop unit.  I use it in the Bialetti Brikka unit which is essentially the same as the Moka except for the crema feature.
2357;Not as yummy as Earth's Best's other flavors;We received this in a dinner variety pack and tried it for the first time today. I always try her baby foods to make sure they are the right temperature (I put them in a bowl and microwave for 6-9 seconds) and taste ok.
2358;not so good popcorn;i bought this popcorn based on other reviews.  the people that wrote the other reviews must work for the popcorn cmpany.
2359;These chips are awesome!;My husband and I stumbled across these chips at our favorite health food store.  WOW!  They are packed with flavor.
2360;yum for dogs!;This treat is the one that my dog always goes for. I can't even buy enough of them.
2361;Solid product.;Item as described.  Zoe, my dog, goes nuts for 'em.
2362;The smell is amazing!;This flavored coffee grabs me while it's brewing and makes me anxious to enjoy my first cup.  You can't stop at one cup.
2363;Worth Purchasing;Goes well as a side when I make steak tips or grilled chicken. My non-gluten free husband loves this rice and there are NEVER leftovers.
2364;Nobody does it better;We must have simply received a bad batch of Jet Fuel the first time.  I left a negative review and one star.
2365;So Coconut all you need are the trees ...;Normally I am not a fan of coconut. And when it comes in jelly beans, I am even less of a fan.
2366;HORRIBLE I CANT BELIEVE THIS!;Terrible! I cannot believe this, I received this item and EVERY SINGLE BAG WAS OPENED BUT 4!!!! I'm stationed in Afghanistan and this was gonna be a snack for my team while going out on missions. I was so embarrassed when the bags were opened and spilt out all in the box, gross! And the box is filled with grease stains.
2367;Kitties Love This;We have eight cats - And they all love their kitty treats every night.  Thankyou Whiskas Temptations, our cats won't eat any other brand than yours.
2368;The Official Lollipop ThrowBack !!!!;I received my product today along with other items all in great condition as usual. Thanks Amazon.
2369;Extremely foul taste!;The first split second after popping one of these in to my mouth wasn't so bad. Then reality set in.
2370;Quality Product at a reasonable price;When there is something really good, I always buy and send the item to friends so that more can share good things together.<br /><br />I found Davidson's Hibiscus flower ordered from Amazon.
2371;My Pup Can't Get Enough of Them;My Rottweiler is allergic to almost every animal protein on the planet. So far, he is doing ok with whitefish and salmon.
2372;Great tree!;Tree arrived in a timely manner and well packaged. Slightly smaller than the tree pictured, I uploaded some pictures of the tree I received for reference.
2373;Great stuff,and a must to have;I got into salts, the more I learned to cook.  Firstly all salt is salt,  but different textures appeal differently on your palate.
2374;Works good;I was looking for an improvement over others I've tried. I liked this better than Gu Brew or the other two I tried (can't remember the name right now) I would say Hammer Heed is a little better than Cytomax imo.
2375;Outstanding but should be less expensive;I got my first jar of it for four bucks at the local Price Chopper. Yes, 16 ounces.
2376;Wonderful dog food!;I have been using this brand for two different dogs now, and they love it. It has made their coat beautiful.
2377;Taste better cold. Has been chlorinated.;I would have preferred this be natural spring water but it was processed to come very close to a natural taste. As long as you get to near freezing temps.
2378;Good.  Would buy if easily available, but wouldn't go out of my way to find it;This is a solid entrant in this sort of sauce category.  Has a bit of kick but not too much.
2379;Not habanero-y at all, but still insanely addicting;The heat here is very very mild. I've had habanero sauces and chips that were so hot they made me cry for help.
2380;One of My Dogs Loved Them, The other Did Not.;My black lab ate them up. Loved them.
2381;Purple potato chips!;I bought this product along with the other variety (Pineapple
2382;Blue Buffalo is good food;Recently my German Shorthaired Pointer started eating a ton of grass. He does eat anything he can find, like an old clif bar that he found on the side of the trail or a croissant that he grabbed out of the front seat of some guys car at the trail head, but grass was unusual.
2383;The BEST Lentils!;Pardina lentils are my favorite.  They hold their shape when cooked so, being a vegetarian, they are great as a meat substitute in things like sloppy joes or casseroles.
2384;Best No Calorie Sweetner;This is the best no calorie sweetner I have ever used.  I have tried most of the national brands and nothing can comare to Ideal No Calorie Sweetner.
2385;Radically improved my cooking and eating experience!;I only use a little of this but it's the best store-bought bouillon I've ever used.  If you don't have time to make your own stock, this is the next best thing.
2386;My life line!;I start everyday with one of these.  It is so satisfying and delicious!  I am 57.
2387;Glutino Pretzels;I have a gluten problem and have a great appreciation for these pretzels. I have no problem with Glutino pretzels, and think they are so much better than any other I have tried.
2388;Great tea in convenient packaging;Earl Gray K-cups are a delicious alternative to coffee for all those with Keurig machines.  It is very convenient and quick.
2389;It's good for what it is;Not sure how some people here are expecting gourmet out of a soup in a cup. It's made out of rice noodles and meant to be fairly healthy.
2390;Over Priced by seller;Ocer priced by the this seller. 9.
2391;Not worth any calories!;I recently tried this cookie and the Ginger flavor.  They were both disgusting.
2392;Try these with Nutella;Remember Dunkaroos? Well I've created my own by dipping these delicious bunny grahams into Nutella. I prefer honey bunny grahams, but this snack also works well with the chocolate or chocolate chip varieties.
2393;Maybe I have a bad batch;I was a bit shocked to see all the high ratings on here, so maybe it's my box: perhaps it was mishandled. So far the two cups I've made taste like plastic and chemicals.
2394;Fabulous!;Excellent taste, quality is great. Love that they are all natural organic and at the price, a bargain! I will definitely order these again.
2395;Twisty pops;Cute little twisty pops. The sticks were short like I read on the reviews, but perfect for our party.
2396;It makes a difference!;"""My father in law who is being treated for colon cancer professes that he knows that this has helped him as he goes through the nasty chemo sessions.."
2397;A hunger stopgap or appetizer for dieters, but just okay flavorwise;Pretty much what you taste is..
2398;Good;"Eat a total half square a day for a chocolate fix (1/8 the quoted ""serving"").<br /><br />As you get used to it (it's bitter compared to what you might be used to) you can eat more at a time, but that only raises the daily price without increasing satisfaction, and adding a few more calories."
2399;Tasty;This liquid vitamin is pretty tasty. I thought it made my water taste like watered down Crystal Light.
2400;Best Gluten Free Bread!;My son has several allergies and finding a gluten free bread that does not have egg, nuts, soy, or corn in it has been a challenge.  The other challenge has been finding something that actually tastes like bread.
2401;rYE tRISCUITS;TRISCUITS CRACKERS ARE THE BEST BUT THIS FLAVOR EXCEEDS ALL OTHERS. THEY GO GREAT WITH ANYTHING AND ONCE YOU TASTE THEM, YOU WILL BE HOOKED ON THEM, TO ABANDON ALL OTHERS! BE AWARE THAT THESE ARE NOT EASILY AVAILABLE IN MASSACHUSETTS.
2402;When;I have not received this item -- it has been some time since it was ordered<br />and PAID FOR -- I will expect to have my money returned and if it is not,<br />the Better Business Bureau will receive a letter from me.<br />Also, remove my name from your list.
2403;Cat Food;Just what I needed was a big bag to go around for my 2 cats. They love it.
2404;Great Protein Snack: Less Fat & More Nutritious.;I've tried all the flavors of the primal soy jerky, and this is my favorite. It has less protein than some of the others ('Hickory' has the most, I think), but still more protein and nutrition for the fat it brings compared to meat jerky (which has much more fat, less calories, and much less nutritional content).
2405;9 yr olds ate the entire box;I didn't like this product all that well. It was really tangy and hurt my stomach.
2406;This is by far the best Marinade on the market.;I use this for chicken, beef and venison. I love to add it into any Chinese food we are having and the kids pour this out as dipping sauce for all kinds of foods.
2407;Dr. McDougall's Tortilla Soup;For an instant soup I find this really not that bad.  It is quick and easy just add hot water and wait a few minutes.
2408;Very impressed;Although I have not bought canidae through Amazon (there is a local store near me that carries the life all stages 40LB bag for $35) I just wanted to write in and remark how impressed I am with this food.  I have an almost 2 year old chocalate lab.
2409;Leaves hair soft, clean;I tried this product and had favorable results.  The smell, color, consistency and lathering potential of this shampoo is just about what you would expect from any shampoo.
2410;i like it!;I love indian food, and this is pretty darn good. I've also tried the mashed vegetable curry and this one is better.
2411;Wheat Berries--A wonderful healthy food;I can't find these where I live so having heard about them being used in receipes (online) I ordered them.  Absolutely wonderful.
2412;Stick candy;Perfect quality.<br />I've ordered this candy from this company several times and it's always perfect.
2413;Used This for a Starved Rescue Hound;I have been involved in dog rescue for many years. I recently took in a very large hound who had been starved within an inch of his life.
2414;Dr Pete Soda Mix Terrible;I love Dr Pepper, Mr. Pips and I even like the Wal-Mart brand.
2415;Black rice better than blue berries for antioxidants.;I cook this is my clay rice cooker,( VitaClay VF7700-8 Chef<br />Gourmet 8-Cup Rice and Slow Cooker) along with one<br />Tiger prawn, broccoli,  and Pataks Hot Lime relish on the<br />side, with some sauce of your choice poured on<br />top of it.  Use your imagination.
2416;DECEPTIVE! DISAPPOINTED!;I HAVE TO SAY IN THE BEGINNING..
2417;Great for those on WW!;"I'm a peanut butter addict but since going on Weight Watchers, I've greatly decreased my intake of PB. It's very pointy and they don't care that it's ""healthy fat""! Enter PB2 - it's basically dehydrated peanuts that have been processed into powder form."
2418;Quick lunch to have on hand anywhere;What an easy way to be certain you will have lunch at work or on the go.  No refrigeration.
2419;Small, Sweet Snacks;Just as described.  These are small cookies with a sweet and chewy center.
2420;Excellent Grain-Free Option;I ordered the Wellness Turkey to create a rotation for our kitten with Felidae grain-free formula. Until tonight he had only eaten Felidae, but when I opened a can of Wellness he went crazy for it! This will definitely be a part of our food rotation.
2421;Perfect for Husbands Lunch Box;I was looking for an alternative to packing containers of ketchup, mustard, and mayo into my husbands lunchbox for when he packed burgers and other sandwiches.  theese were perfect! A large quantity but has a long shelf life.
2422;Very high salt content;This stuff tastes well, and doesn't taste gluten-free, as others have noted. It's nice and cheesy.
2423;Love ,love,love;Great,light oil.Our boy has multiple food intolerances and this oil is a life saver for us because it is the only oil he can have.
2424;IMHO, the best coffee;This coffee along with the Tassimo coffee machine makes the best single cup of coffee. This coffee along with many other choices Tassimo offers makes it a no brainer if you really love coffees and teas.
2425;Left over jerky crumbs!;Unfortunately this is a very poor representation of Jack Link's Beef Jerky. The bags are small and the jerky is in very small pieces and crumbs.
2426;Perfect for when out and about;We tried the formula powder and formula dispenser when we were out of the house but with twins that became a hassle. It's worth the extra money to us just to be able to pop these little bottles open and pour it into a bottle.
2427;Will Not Buy Again;I usually like Betty Crocker meals. This is the first and last time I will get this one! I followed every step of the directions and had to throw the whole meal out! There was almost no chicken or veggies in the mix.
2428;Kwong Sang Tit Koon Yum;This is actually Tie Guan Yin oolong tea. Like other teas in its class, this one has been roasted to some extent
2429;Clif Crunch Bar;I love these things! Usually they go on sale on Amazon and I only buy them when they are about $6 - 7 for the pack of two. My favorite kind is the white chocolate macadamia nut.
2430;Good. Not for a chocolate fix :);I love love love, dark chocolate, and so I decided to get these bars. I will say that I havent shopped around to find a lot of bars.
2431;Decent taste;The producers of this coffee did a marvelous job on the artistic packaging, but the coffee itself lacks the pizazz I'd expect from a coffee pod. I made the coffee in more than just the coffee pod, including taking the grinds out of the pod and putting them through my own filter, but the result was still the same--the taste was forgettable.
2432;Great for my toddler with milk allergy;I had my son on Earths Best until his first birthday, and when we introduced milk found out that he had a allergy. He is fine with yogurt/cheeses, but straight milk turns his face bright red.
2433;Good Soup!;This is a good main dish when you add a pound of ground round or ground sirloin. It is made with natural ingredients so I feel good about feeding it to my family.
2434;Surprisingly Good;Hontesly, I thought when I had to buy six packages what if I don't like this.  But it is wonderful.
2435;These are good!;My girlfriend can't have any gluten, basically anything at all with wheat. Most of the gluten free products that would normally be made with wheat flour either taste weird or have a odd texture to them when you are chewing.
2436;It's Instant Coffee ...;I have a friend that gets Armenian coffee sent from his relatives back home in Armenia.  It is a fine powder that you put in a cup, pour water over, stir and drink (I put in sugar before I drink).
2437;Sauce with some kick;The whole family favored this flavor ove the Chipolte one. They both are very creamy.
2438;Let me be blunt;
2439;My dogs love the Greenies, and I like Amazon's price...;I am an enabler.  My two dogs have an insatiable addiction to Greenies.
2440;Great oil;This olive oil so far is great. I love that it is in a tin so that I can leave it on the counter rather than having to place it in the cabinet.
2441;A Cross Between Starbucks and the Truck Stop...;If there is a weakness with the Keurig coffee system, it's that most of the K-Cups--even the Extra Bold varieties--tend to brew a weaker cup of coffee, lacking the full flavor of a regularly brewed cup of Joe. I've therefore learned to order sampler packs if available, so I don't get stuck with a bunch of K-Cups I don't like.
2442;The best I've tried;I was somewhat skeptical because the reviews were all so good it seemed too good to be true but I took my chances and don't regret it. I bought the shampoo and creme rinse and they both are amazing.
2443;Delicious!;I've ordered this honey before and am very satisfied with the quality, however, the packaging seems to be an issue.  Three cases and each one had leakage from several bottles--not too significant but enough to make a mess.
2444;Castor & Pollux Organix Feline Formula, Organic Turkey Formula;The ingredients are wholesome, but pricey.  I have four cats (unrelated, in case 'taste' runs in a family), and none of the four find it appealing.
2445;Surprised to find good coffee in a can!!;"As a devout drinker of good, fresh roasted/ground/drip brewed, strong coffee, I approached this can of ILLYissimo espresso with much skepticism and profoundly low expectations. The experience of drinking it caught me by complete surprise as it is entirely acceptable as a cold/cool glass of coffee on the run!<br /><br />Described by another reviewer as ""muddy water in a can"", I can only infer that strong coffee is not to that person's liking."
2446;Found it;Born and raised in Louisiana then moved out of state. Quest for strong, intense coffee without bitterness was disappointing.
2447;Inconsistent;I ordered my first 5# package and we thought they were some of the best we've ever tasted. A few months later I ordered another 5# - what a difference! We can't even eat them.
2448;Au Gratin Potatoes;January 3, 2011<br /><br />I purchased these potatoes from Omaha Steaks online last week. I was not sure what to expect .
2449;Chew Eez Dog Treats;Good product but these prices are way higher than in grocery stores. Have not seen the beef-flavored ones in ages.
2450;very minty.;my husband loves it. I am okay with it.
2451;Closest thing to brown bread I've found;I've been gluten-free for over 7 years and the bread is getting better. This type tended to crumble in the package more than tapioca or brown rice bread.
2452;This May or May Not Be So...;"The review below says that the ingredients are not digestible.  It is not clear if they are talking about feline or canine greenies, AND in my esperience, both my dogs and cats have digested their respective greenies ""just fine."
2453;More information, please;It would be nice if Amazon would take responsibility for providing complete product information for the items they sell. For example, a buyer might assume that the name Dagoba was significant, perhaps representing the company that manufactures the products.
2454;Very large flakes;This has a great, fresh, finishing salt. I personally prefer Murray River Pink Salt for the more delicate crunch, but I do like this for a change.
2455;Wow!  Who knew wheatgrass was so delicious?!?  (well, millions of you out there, I would guess.....);"Bought this to grow for my cat.  I have tasted the wheatgrass and, ""."
2456;They Loved it;This was sent as a gift.  More than once I was told how happily they munched on these.
2457;Kind Fruit and Nut Bars;I love ordering from Amazon because items come within a reasonable amount of time.  However, ordering from outside Amazon (except for books) not so much.
2458;Self-Control is the Issue!;"I am not the type that ever writes reviews, especially for the internet, but Pop Chips are the best  ""potato chips"" that I have ever had -- so much so that I have to limit myself to one bag per week!  A friend introduced Pop Chips to me and I immediately told her that I hated her because they are so good, they are irrisistable.  I purchased a box of 12 to be delivered every three months so that I can limit myself to one bag per week ."
2459;Add wonderful fragrance to your cooking;I first found this herb blend in San Francisco. I'm delighted that I can re-stock my cupboard again.
2460;Great pancake mix;I thought this sounded like a good mix.I made a batch & it was great.
2461;favorite spice;my family loves this spice on pizza and pasta (as advertised).  it is only occasionally in the grocery store.
2462;Rip Off;I bought six pasty meat pies for $34.94.
2463;Short Lived;"I am a law student and my study schedule rarely works well with my two dogs. In order to keep them occupied, I routinely give them bones similar to these as ""get away from me for three hours and let me study"" treats."
2464;Received in plain cardboard box;This was so disappointing. I was happy to get the Friday deal on the 50 CT.
2465;Big botle lasts long!;I am not a big water drinker but I am trying to be.  What I like about the Vitamin Squeeze Energy Drink is that it comes in a large 12-ounce bottle and is not only all natural but zero calories.
2466;Just Like Home-Baked!;I was very pleasantly surprised when I first tasted one of these cookies!  They were soft and tasty--much like my home-baked peanut butter cookies--only better since I tend to over-bake mine!<br /><br />I have many allergies so it's difficult for me to find pre-made cookies I can safely eat.  Barley and corn starch, which I am very allergic to, find their way masked in many ingredients for pre-made food products.
2467;Misleading calorie count--lots more than 45 calories per serving!!!;I Loooove peanut better and this ersatz butter tastes pretty good to me and has 0 cholesterol. Nevertheless, because of its high calorie count and high price, I can stretch the rating to only 3 stars.
2468;It's Not Horrible;Another coffee that smells great but falls short on actual flavor..
2469;Good stuff;Great tasting with just the right texture. Always hits the spot for a lite snack, simple and tasty.
2470;"Good ""store bought"" cookies";"I really like the ""crunchy"" chocolate chip cookies . ."
2471;Delighted!;I've searched high and low for Pommery Green Peppercorn Mustard locally, and was delighted to find it at the Frenchy Bee, through Amazon.  The service was exceptional.
2472;Vegan Organic Fair Trade Shade Grown Choice;Organic. Fair Trade.
2473;ok;This was very nice in the pic which is why I picked this..
2474;KIND;Our whole foods diet makes eating tricky sometimes, so when I saw KIND bars in the supermarket I was really excited. Our tastebuds are used to nearly no sugar, no salt and absolutely no preservatives or additives so these bars hit the spot.
2475;a bit 2 chocolatie for me;i was a bit disappointed at the product b/c it's got too much chocolate on it.  they tasted more like candy bars more so than just chocolate covered cashews.
2476;DELICIOUS!!!;I LOVE LOVE LOVE this oatmeal.  It is perfect for someone who is trying to loose weight because it really keeps you full.
2477;Weird flavors....;I don't know why everyone loves these chips. They are healthy but taste disgusting.
2478;Not peppermint, weak chocolate, not sweet, not creamy;I have  started experimenting with different brands of Peppermint Hot Cocoa and I started with Stephen's Gourmet Candy Cane Hot Cocoa.  It was a home run.
2479;DELICIOUS!;I can't believe I am the first to rate these bars!  Larabars are awesome..
2480;Great Sauce!;Since Rib-It went out of business, we had a tough time finding another sauce we loved until we found Bone Suckin sauce.  We prefer the flavor of the 'hot' variations even though the flavor isn't really hot.
2481;Great Buy;"I purchased a small amount of this product at a local health food store right after receiving my order and did a ""taste test"" they were identical and these are half the price of the local store. They arrived quickly, were fully labeled and airtight seal."
2482;So good that I had to come review this 30 seconds after getting my coffee;Ok, so it is a little strange that these literally come in a brown paper bag. But, I don't care.
2483;quick, easy and delicious!!;So good. My kids and I both loved it.
2484;Poor substitute;Save yourself from trying these k-cups - not a good substitute for the typical ones, like the ones from Green Mountain.  Bitter taste and unpleasant after taste as well.
2485;Exactly like Brazilian Heart of Palms;Have you been looking for those heart of palms that you ate at a Brazilian restaurant, or even in your last trip to Brazil?<br />Your search is over!<br />Even though these come from Peru, they are from the exact same palm tree of Brazilian heart of palms.<br /><br />This product is not mushy, tasteless, yellowish, and of a conical shape like those from Ecuador, Costa Rica, etc.
2486;Good in stir-fry;These are seitan-ish strips of un-Pollanesque wheat gluten.  I found them to be decent when chopped and stir fried into mixed vegetables, and you could reduce the broth to gravy.
2487;delicious with everything!  alone....well an aquired taste;This product helped a friend lose 50 lbs and I have lost about 10 lbs on this product with some exercise and other diet changes (low or no carbs).  Basically this is a cracker, a bread product with low calories and high fiber and is very filling.
2488;Sweeta;My family has been using this sweetner in iced tea forever.  It is difficult to locate in the stores so ordering by Amazon is the easiest and fastest way to get it.
2489;Suprisingly good.;Walden Farms salad dressings are a hit and miss.  Some of them are a bit off, and some of them are really good, so I decided to try 'Asian' and was delighted.
2490;LaFlorentine Panettone;I was concernd that these Panettone might be dry but found they were exceptionally moist, light and just as they should be.  Gave one to a friend that had never tasted a Panettone - she loved it!  A sure hit for that person hard to please.
2491;Pill pockets;These pill pockets are great.  It's so much easier than trying to wrap my dogs pills in meats or cheeses.
2492;Tastes fresh;I've tried a couple of brands of coconut water.  This comes closer to drinking from a fresh tender coconut than the others.
2493;Just as advertised;I really like this coconut water, but I was surprised that per 17oz box it's the same price at Wegman's.  Probably won't be ordering again unless there's some sort of discount.
2494;It sure is - Kitty Crack!;I first learned about this product a year ago, and I've been giving it to my cats ever since. They get it once a day as a treat, and they love it.
2495;I put it in my cereal!;Ok not really but this stuff is great! It's best with steak but works with any meat really, particularly if you're grilling. Fire it on some chicken and put it with some alfredo.
2496;Bought it for kids and wife;They said the salt and vinegar were horrible! Blecht! Couldn't get the awful taste out of their mouth. Now i'm stuck with this box of popchips! lol.
2497;Horrible;I had to pick up a grocery store brand after running out of our regular Innova dog food. I fed this to my 160lb dog for a week and could not believe the amount of waste this brand produced! He was going up to 10 times a day! Unbelievable! This just goes to show how much filler is in this food.
2498;Back to my childhood;I remembered getting Smarties at the little variety store across the street from my school when I was in the fifth grade. When I saw these, I had to get a box and set them out for my friends when they come to visit.
2499;It's supposed to do what?;We sprayed this product as directed on a light to moderate growth of grass, dandelions, and other miscellaneous weeds in a greenbelt along our house.  That was on Sunday, 05 February.
2500;Delicious and Nutritious!;I am thrilled Amazon is now offering this delicious snack! A friend introduced me to it a month or two back, and I was hooked immediately. Not only was it healthy and tasted good, but I also was amazed with the amount in the bag.
2501;Good coffee, slight problems w/grounds;In general, I love Coffee People coffee. My only beef with them in general is that I often get coffee grounds in my brewed coffee, and I don't usually have this happen with other brands of K-cups.
2502;Spicy, sweet and tangy -- flavor perfection!;What an outstanding spice blend!!!  It will allow you to create a most unusual and delicious dish -- a wonderful blend of spicy, sweet and tangy flavors accenting the chicken.  Adding dates, sesame seed, cilantro, honey and lemon to the exotic blend of spices, you will create a dish that is quite unlike anything you've ever eaten.
2503;These are GREAT!;Food SHOULD taste good and these chips live up to their name. But the best part is, they have a lot of healthy ingredients, including high oleic oils that may increase good cholesterol.
2504;Kids Love 'Em!!;The kids love 'em and what could be better than that?  I bought one box at the local grocery and glad to see they are available here.  We tried the strawberry, frosted, and like other reviewers I agree:  not too sweet, right amount of frosting.
2505;The kid likes it!;Mama Grain and Amaranth Ratatouille from Happy Baby have been long-time favorites since my son was about 10 months old. Even now he is a toddler, he still eats Mama Grain on occasion - it's good to take with us if we're eating out and he's being picky about what's available.
2506;tea pot and tea;I have enjoyed the glass teapot, and even the packaging, but the tea flowers did not have hardly any flavor..
2507;Wish They Were in China;I live in China, and I am unable to find anything made by Jack Link's here. I am able to buy different beef jerky products here, but they just don't taste the same.
2508;Can't make it taste good enough for a serious trial;I can't tell you if this works as a diuretic, because it tastes so bad, I can't make myself drink enough of it for a decent trial. Somebody must like it or they wouldn't keep making it, but it's not for me.
2509;Delish!;We love these. They are absolutely delicious and the handy pouch is convenient for sipping on the go.
2510;Not Earths Best!!!!;Peel back your labels! This is NOT Earths Best Formula. It is repackaged and most containers have pieces of other labels from the original brand on it.
2511;Unique flavor, excellent healthy snack;We love Garden of Eatin' chips. Our favorites varieties are Hot Dpicy Blues and Guacamole.
2512;Very unhappy!!!!;I love ordering from Amazon..
2513;Warning: These smell and taste like dog food :(;I am a vegetarian, and I wanted so badly to like this vegan jerky. As soon as I opened the package, the first thing I noticed was that the jerky is very moist, not like real beef jerky at all (which I understand to be dry and chewy).
2514;Amazing Bundt Cakes!;I received a Red Velvet Bundt Cake from FantasiCakes!  It was delivered by UPS and showed up in perfect condition.  It was packed really well to assure that it came that way.
2515;Crazy price hike;Great deal at about $11.  I bought a bag and subscribed for scheduled delivery.
2516;Healthy and  Tasty;I love this KIND bar.  It is healthy with the antioxidants and protein.
2517;Best I have found;Best dried cherries I have found so far. Arrived in good condition.
2518;The Best I've Found So Far;Okay, these are pretty darn tasty.  I have tried several different brands of veggie jerky, and so far, these are my faves.
2519;They actually work!;In September 2009, my vet gave me a few of the fish-flavored chews when I picked my cat up from his teeth cleaning surgery. I wasn't sure about them, but my cat's 12, needs a special canned-food diet, & he needed anesthetized teeth cleaning every year.
2520;Wish it dissolved better in hot water, but the taste is perfect!;I do have to use my stick blender when making broth with this product, but I've been using Vogue Cuisine seasoning bases for a while and I could not love them more as a substitute for bouillon cubes and chicken broth in recipes. I was thrilled to find a source for them on Amazon when our local grocery stopped carrying them.
2521;Slimey prunes;We are a prune loving family. I buy several pounds of organic prunes each month.
2522;Yogi Green Kombucha Herbal Tea;I have a few problems with being constipated, to be blunt.  This tea is magic.
2523;GREAT PRODUCT!;We eat a lot of pistachios and these are the best. Used to buy Wonderful (and other brands) but then found they are not USA, too many are not cracked and they are smallish.
2524;herbal tea;Cooper's all that razzberry teapods can be made and enjoyed without the special gizmo. The tea can get too strong though if you leave it to seep in a cup like an ordinary tea bag.
2525;Moist and chewy granola, 190 calories in 1/2 cup!!!;I've been on the search for a granola that is moist and chewy and doesn't taste and feel like dried pegboard.  This is it!!!!  And check out the ingredient list!  Nothing that you can't spell or that contains more than 5 syllables.
2526;Exactly as described;The chips were wonderful as expected. The cardboard shipping container (box) had us worried since it arrived and was very crushed accordian style.
2527;Not as spicy as I thought it would be but still very good;Taco Bell Chipotle Sauce isn't quite as spicy as I thought it would be but it is still creamy and tasty and a little goes a long way.<br /><br />The taste is almost like a barbeque sauce with a bit of spice to it.
2528;Great Black Cherry Flavor - Highly Recommended;"These David's Signature Beyond Gourmet ""Black Cherry"" jelly beans are very good tasting and somewhat on the sweet side. The black cherry flavor is very natural tasting but because they are fairly sweet my family enjoys these more than I do."
2529;These don't taste bad. They don't taste great, either.;They don't fill you up.<br /><br />My plan was, for lunch, to slowly eat one of these with a large glass of water.
2530;Pasteurized?;This product description does not say whether this product is pasteurized. Alton Brown on Good Eats says that if pomegranate juice is pasteurized you lose a lot of the antioxidant benefits.
2531;coffee lover;This coffee is not for light coffee drinker! This coffee is EXTREMELY bold, strong and smooth. I love this coffee.
2532;Addicting & delicious!;Man, where has this stuff been all my life? I use it on all kinds of foods. I sread it on eggs, quiche, potatoes.
2533;TOTAL HIGHWAY ROBBERY PRICE;THE PRICE LISTED FROM AMAZON.COM FOR THIS PRODUCT IS BEYOND REPROACH.
2534;Bay Laurel and olive tree;I was very happy with the bay laurel plant.  Very healthy.
2535;Try frozen;I just finished my second box of the dark choco cherry cashew. Im over in a hot box so I knew they would arrive somewhat melted, so I threw them in the freezer and they were amazing! If you have kids I dont recommend freezing them but if not you should try esp if they arrive melted they harden up (no mess at all).
2536;My dog is not impressed;I really want to like this product because of the great things Newman's have done and the fact that all the proceeds go to charity. I like the fact that the ingredients are all top quality and organic.
2537;Much too spicy for me;This rating is based on my personal taste - has way too much cayenne pepper for me.  People who like really<br />spicy food would probably love it.
2538;You can call it dal or hummus & it's easy;The biggest pain to making authentic hummus from dried chick peas is removing the chick peas' skins after they've been cooked, after hours of soaking the dried beans, prior to cooking. Bob's Red Mill Chana Dal Beans removes the real work.
2539;I'm a sap for this maple syrup;"<a href=""http://www.amazon."
2540;Great substitute for other cheese puffs;Yum Yum!!! I bought a case of these for a camping trip my daughter was going on with her cross country team..
2541;My dog loves them;Great product.  My dog loves the bones and they come in a ziplock bag inside the box.
2542;Dark Magic Fits My Coffee Craving!;This is an excellent coffee either brewed hot or over ice. I drink a lot of ice coffee and love Dark Magic for it's great taste, and boldness.
2543;Can't Complain...;The kids like cocoa. Perfect when you can't make the kids hot choco.
2544;multiple cats, need stuff in bulk;Thanks for placing bulk supplies on the site.  A house with multiple cats needs quantity.
2545;The perfect potato chips.;I discovered these chips for the first time while vacationing with my wife in New Hampshire last fall.  Wherever I travel, I'm in search of excellent potato chips, and these clearly rank with the best I've ever eaten.
2546;more, more , more;My 7 1/2 year old Sheltie, Max, just loves these treats.  We also have to watch his diet--don't want him to gain weight for those  joints to work harder and these are just perfect because they are very low in fat.
2547;Great;My dogs have loved this product for 22+ Years. Not my main source of nutrition for them but a nice treat.
2548;Love the flavor and the convenience!;To make some tofu burger, all you need is a pack of this mix and a pack of tofu. Just squeeze the tofu to get the liquid as much as possible, and just mix in! It'll be a perfect consistency after kneading a bit, and can make 4 patties out of it (it states it'll make 5 patties but I found the size too small).
2549;Fenugreek Seed Tea;I bought this product because I read on a couple other sites that it can help with head and chest congestion. I also read it is safe to use while breastfeeding.
2550;Inconsistent Taste;I first tasted Annie Chun's seaweed three years ago while in California. It was delicious, especially the Wasabi, so I purchased about ten packs.
2551;will not drink these;The order arrived quickly but boxes were damp as if the juices were leaked. There was a moldy smell in the boxes and it was attached with the individual pouches.
2552;Best dog bone!;My puggle can devour most bones in minutes. These last a long time.
2553;Lots of Tea;"Of the k-cups listed (pictured) I didn't get eight, considering is says ""assortment may vary"" I didn't find this terribly objectionable.  However of the eight replacements, four were English Breakfast teas, two were other teas, and two were other duplicates."
2554;The only way I'll make waffles;Until I found out about this product, I wouldn't bother making pancakes or waffles. When cooking for one person, it's just not worth the cleanup time.
2555;Economy;This is one of the best dog foods on the market. My dog loves it, and is healthy and happy.
2556;Nestle Milk Chocolate Candy Bars;I grew up with this product while living in Cleveland, Ohio.  I always preferred it to Hershey's Milk Chocolate.
2557;Did not go over well with my children.;While my children enjoy the apple crisps from this company, the peach crisps were rejected. Odd taste to them.
2558;OK but prefer the Taco Spicey Ranchero;I like the taco Bell Jalapeno Sauce OK, but I found the Taco Bell Spicey Ranchero, which I previously reviewed, to be more spicey and flavorful than the Taco Jalapeno Sauce.  The Jalapeno Sauce does have a taste of Jalapeno, but there is something about it that falls somewhat short in my opinion.
2559;Great Purchase on the Syrups;I was glad to find an assortment of the basic flavors of Sugar Free Torani.  I'd only tried two of the in the past because of limited availability of the products in my area, so I was able to try new flavors.
2560;Doggy Likes!;My 10 lbs chihuahua/doxie mix is a picky eater.  He isn't motivated by food at all, and it's always a trial and error when it comes to trying out a new treat.
2561;Best flavor, texture and results!;This is the best peanut flour I've tried! It has a smooth, deep, roasted flavor that just kicks everything you put it in.<br />I've used it to make a cooked frosting (really!), and various LC bread/pancake items.
2562;I love this!  PB2 Made a convert out of me!;"I was never a huge peanut butter ""fan"", especially as it is so high in fat.  But I recently had stomach surgery and need higher protein foods."
2563;Good;The Ginger People brand is among the best I have tried. This variety is not very hot/spicy compared to the crystallized ginger they sell.
2564;Nummy Granola Bar;This is a really nummy and nutty bar with chocolate goodness.  The best granola bar that I have had and nowhere near the fat/sugar of a candy bar.
2565;Magical Blooming Tea Flowers Are a Delight for the Senses;My friend took me to a wonderful Thai restaurant for my birthday and the blooming tea flowers were a delightful suprise! Having no idea they even existed, they infused [pun intended] the meal with magic that was reminiscent of the beautiful blooming shell flowers of my childhood about 60 years ago.<br /><br />What fun to be able to offer friends a magical triple delight of seeing the tea flowers bloom, smelling the tea, then tasting the delicious Jasmine tea.
2566;Top of the line;Delicate, sweet and flavorsome ,the Muir Glen products are in a class of their own.Although priced on the high end compared with the supercenters(I suspect because of the shipping weight)these are well worth the cost  for the health benefits alone.
2567;Best crunchy granola bar!;I have been trying to eat better. And I have been going on photo walks.
2568;Decent flavor that goes a long way;This product does the trick for me- provides a reasonable cherry flavor for beverages (soda in my case). On the single bottle (rather than 3-pack) variant of this product some reviewers say the flavor is not very strong.
2569;Toffee Biscottti cookies;I love these cookies with hot tea. They are delicious.
2570;great peanut taste;makes chicken taste so good .  Just coat it and Bake Better than some resturant peanut sauces.
2571;misrepresented in product description;This honey is NOT RAW, nor is it represented as such on the product label, which is impossible to read in full on the web page. By the taste and texture of it, it most definitely has been heated, and is only a pale shadow of what a raw star thistle honey is.
2572;Great fruit.;I can't get enough of lychee! I go through at least one can a day at breakfast, and Roland delivers a bulk product here that satisfies my craving. I really wish they were grown more here in the US - fresh lychee from Florida or California is tremendously expensive.
2573;The greatest dog treats!;I have a very picky puppy when it comes to treats. She loves the purebites chicken treats, she goes crazy for them whenever she hears the bag opening or even crinkling.
2574;Yummy;I found these cookies really moist and yummy. Good size and perfect for a snack break or for breakfast.
2575;HOT STUFF!!!;This stuff is pretty dang hot.  It doesn't have the best flavor, but that is understandable for sauce that comes with a dropper.
2576;benecol chews;I have been using this product for a while now and believe it helps me keep my cholesterol under control.  The taste is very pleasing.
2577;Very close to real thing;I've been veggie for a little over a year and jerky is something that I missed, mostly because I liked the chewy texture and saltiness of beef jerky. This product is very much like the real thing as far as texture and taste.
2578;purebites;These treats are amazing. when I first gave it to my dog he sniffed it for a while, after that she fell in love with the food.
2579;Great for Constipation;Love the product.  It was recommended to me by my nutritionist.
2580;Best Cheese Puffs;I love cheese and things made with cheese, so I've had many cheese puffs.  These have a little blue cheese added which gives them a sharper flavor than just cheddar.
2581;Yum;We're on auto-delivery for this nutritious, delicious cereal -- one of the best we'ved tried.  I'd have stopped there but the system is asking me for more words, so:  you can get it cheaper elsewhere.
2582;This really works!;I honestly never thought in a million years that this stuff would really work well. I've been using shampoos and conditioners from everything from Lazartigue to Kiehls and always had a problem with a dry, itchy scalp and dandruff.
2583;Terrific treat!;"My two crunchy snacks of choice for some time now have been <a href=""http://www.amazon."
2584;This is delicious!!!!;Now, I am going to be honest. I had gotten the powered peanut butter and honestly, I did not care for it that much.
2585;Nothing that can't be fixed.;Perhaps it's because I live in northern Canada (although that shouldn't be an excuse), but it took a few days for the product to be shipped.  Once, however, it was, it arrive on the last day of the projected delivery day.
2586;So many bears...so many;This was a good purchase. Though it may seem excessive to have 5 pounds of gummi bears, I assure you, It is not.
2587;It was the most amazing coffee !!!!;I tried this one and the Organic Blend before I knew that John Weaver was the master roaster at PEETS coffee for 20 over years and left them to start his own label.  This coffee is simply AMAZING.
2588;Nasty Dried Peaches!;Dried peaches ordered from nutricity.com via Amazon.
2589;Long time favorite;I owned a natural foods store for many years, and these cookies were one of our best sellers. Everybody loves them.
2590;My dog Chablis loves these treats!!!!!!;This seller provides swift service.  I have ordered the dog treats twice---the last time, I ordered four pounds so I will have tons on hand.
2591;Taste terrible, way too strong;Unless you like salt vinegar chips as salty as eating actual pinches of salt and drinking actual vinegar, i doubt you will like these chips.  These are the saltiest & sourest chips I have ever had, and the only reason stops me from throwing these away is because I paid for 2 full boxes and dont like to waste food.
2592;Great!;My dog goes crazy when I mention the word Greenies.  He hasn't put on any extra weight since I have been giving them to him.
2593;Delicious!;Taco Bell's Chipotle Sauce has a creamy texture, packed with a tangy taste that's perfect for tacos, chip dip, Chinese fried rice, pizza (yes, pizza) and even sandwiches. It's flavorful and spicy, but not in a hot way.
2594;Yum.;Like that is it organic, don't like that it comes in plastic containers.  Earth's Best was always our first choice, but Gerber Organics comes a close second.
2595;So glad Amazon has it-saves me another trip to Tennessee;"After touring the distillery in Lynchburg, it was hard to find an appropriate thank you gift for ""Nana"" after she watched the kids for a week. After wandering around the Lynchburg General Store (the official store of Jack Daniels Distillery) I happened upon their mustards and BBQ sauces."
2596;Good taste at a great value...;"This is a smooth, easy-going coffee that we love to use with flavored creamers and other ""recipes"" that we come up with.  The value is excellent."
2597;My cat went nuts!;My fiancee brought this home from his moms and my cat went crazy! She inhaled an entire can in seconds and then begged for more. I completely grossed my fiancee out when I tasted it and let me tell you as someone who is an avid cook the Chicken Pot Pie is very good.
2598;Another memory from my youth destroyed by corporate America.;This stuff used to have a nice rich BBQ sauce covering the 7 little babies<br />you see when you pop the top off this can, but now its all watered down and<br />has no flavor at all. Its just red goop, and very little of that.
2599;Ahmad English Tea No.1;I have been buying this tea for a while now from another store, so I already knew how good it is. In fact, I think this is the best tea one can get.
2600;Great taste, but I would recommend bulk packaging;I like experimenting with different drinks, and I found these ready to make ice tea mixes to my taste.  They really have the mango flavor, without a significant aftertaste.
2601;Quality has gone downhill over the years;I have been making pumpkin pies and other treats for years.  And I have noticed how over the years that Libbys Pumpkin has become less and less dense, no doubt to keep the pricing and profit margins at a certain point.
2602;the.best.coffee.ever;This is the best coffee I have ever had ..
2603;This is gluten free??;As the title says you wouldn't know this was gluten free unless you made it yourself. As a wonderful bonus I cook this cornbread in our bread maker on the cake setting.
2604;Could not be more pleased;This product is good as advertised. I've only had it for 2 days and only use it in shakes.
2605;Great price, great value;Save on money. buy this hot chocolate in bulk.
2606;Best price on zukes;Zukes are great training treats because they are small and quickly consumed so you can continue what you're working on.  I've shopped everywhere for them and Amazon is the best price I've found so we order them frequently.
2607;Red sea salt;Used it in a recipe for pulled-pork.  Had never heard of it before and couldn't find it locally.
2608;it is about the container;Sweetened condensed milk is yummy, we all know that.  What makes this product great is the container used.
2609;Great For Mocha Iced Coffee!;I use this along with some starbucks via to make a Mocha iced coffee! if you keep it in the fridge it's almost like fudge, it's thick but not too thick. great over iced cream, dissolves in milk too if you like dark chocolate milk, it tastes sweet but not too sweet and truly has a dark chocolate taste to it.
2610;Easy and festive;I personally just prefer the regular spiced hot cider (no caramel). I like it a lot and when having guests it's easy to just have them on hand.
2611;chewy;Apples and strawberries were crunchy and satisfying.  Pears were chewy and suspect as we were expecting crunchy.
2612;Interesting and enjoyable;Revolution Earl Grey Lavender Tea is a blend of Ceylon, Darjeeling, and Formosa oolong teas scented with French lavender buds in addition to the usual oil of bergamot.<br /><br />This tea comes in a pyramid-shaped bag with fine mesh that allows the leaves to bloom to make two pints of strong tea.
2613;WTF? C&P Used to be their favorite kibble.;Ordinarily my dogs cannot get enough of this flavor of C&P.  When I spend this kind of $$ for kibble, I expect them to eat every last crumb.
2614;Great stuff!!;I wasn't sure what to expect when I first tried the Izze Sparkling drink, but I was pleasantly surprised. The drink is carbonated, but the carbonation is just right, not too strong or too weak.
2615;Don't underestimate this little packet;Easy to travel with. I've used in Europe, I've used in American Wilderness.
2616;A darned good Mother's Day gift;"I bought this product, the ""Art of Appreciation Gift Baskets Decadent Chocolate Truffle Treats"", for my wife for Mother's Day.  My wife has reached the point in her life where she doesn't like me to buy her jewelry very much (""I have more than I can wear now!""), and while flowers are nice, a guy can't just get his girl flowers on every occasion."
2617;Migraine Food!;"Sure they're tasty, but they trigger a migraine in MSG sensitive people.<br />Also, they contain corn, which also contributes to their tastiness I'm sure,<br />but seems silly for a ""Rice"" chip, which is what I thought I was buying to avoid corn."
2618;Better than Milk;I love this stuff, it makes great iced coffee. Mainly I buy it for cereal.
2619;SALT OF THE EARTH - Himalayan Style;Silly me, I didn't even know there was such a thing as pink Himalayan salt.  A friend actually mentioned it to me as we were discussing moving into a vegetarian life style.
2620;Herbs were great, tomatoes a flop;I was so pleased with the herbs I grew in my standard Aerogarden I bought a second one so I could grow both herbs and cherry tomatoes. Wrong! The herbs did fine again, but what they fail to tell you is that the tomatoes require 8 hours of absolute darkness.
2621;A good cup of coffee for the Keurig;"In Louisiana we love a good bold cup of coffee and with the Keurig it's often hard to get the mug size cup with a good hearty flavor. The Jet fuel helps satisfy that longing for the morning ""kick""."
2622;Best Trail Mix;I LOVE this trail mix. I got it a lot cheaper at Sam's, but I hate having to fight the crowds to go get it.
2623;Reasonable alternative to sugary drinks;This is not the ideal or the most nutritious of drinks, but if it stops you from drinking sugary drinks, then it is definitely an alternative to consider.<br /><br />The taste is mostly strawberryish in a Kool Aid kind of way.
2624;pernigotti cocoa very good;I was looking for an above average cocoa powder for baking. I ordered pernigotti cocoa from ChefStop through Amazon.
2625;I can't believe it's not homemade! Thanksgiving Memories!;Had these from store 3 years ago and can't find anymore, but the memory hasn't faded as we still speak about them. They taste homemade, that is if you have a French pastry chef living at home.
2626;Great alternative;Corn noodles are one of our favorite alternatives to regular pasta. One of our daughter's has celiac disease and so the rest of us join her at mealtimes to eat gluten free.
2627;Crisp and Delicious!;This tea is delightful! It's Crisp and delicious.  I love the fact that it is not pre-sweeted and it does not contain lemon.
2628;yummy;well if you like chai,and are tired of paying a lot at Starbucks..
2629;Hindered by the peppercorn;The white chocolate is really delicious. It's not too sweet like most white chocolate.
2630;Yummy!;Love these muffins.  I like that they are made with just water, so they make a very easy addition to dinner.
2631;Very good hot chocolate.;I really like this hot chocolate mix.  I was concerned, when I read some of the reviews, that I would not like it but I like it alot.
2632;Not my kind of flavor;I've only eaten the KIND bar once, and it was definitely not this flavor but I didn't realize it until I opened it up and tasted it.  I love mango.
2633;A Lime flavored spicey Nut;Lime and Chili seemed a strange combination but the Lime Flavor is natural, not sweet, just tart enough to bring out the chili spice to create a great tasting nut treat to snack on.  Almonds are a great, fun snack and having one that has a Lime Tart Flavor is absolutely Fabulous.
2634;Excellant coffee Price is out of line;Excellent coffee, bold with no bitter after taste.<br />Price is way out of line.
2635;Great flavor;I like regular Special K but it's a little bland.  This stuff is great.
2636;I  would purchase this product again;This product is great.  If you are gluten free it is a must have in your house.
2637;Tastes good?  I don't think so;I was told by my doctor to go off of milk for awhile, so I started looking around for some food products that didn't have any milk in them.  I happened to find this brand on Amazon.
2638;funny texture;The gellatin is from beef, not goat, which I think explains the texture of them.  They are chewy, more of a soft candy, and there is some grit to them.
2639;BFF Top Grade Cat Food;Very good quality cat food.  Made at a human food factory with human grade ingredients.
2640;Tastes great and no sulfites;I was skeptical at first ordering this online, but it got to me in perfect condition, and was very fresh testing.  I am very happy to have found a good lemon juice without sulfites.
2641;great with medjool dates!;I love opening up a medjool date and lathering in some cacao bliss..
2642;Wonderful Snack;Cracker Nuts are just Wonderful! I live on Guam right now, & these are produced in the Philippines. I'm moving back stateside soon & have been trying to figure out what I should bring back with me that I know won't be sold in the states.
2643;great high protein treat;Tastes almost too good, like a regular cookie.  Soft, sweet.
2644;Great Thai Ice Tea;I read the instructions on the back but I found it too messy. So I decided to place 6 tablespoons of the tea into my coffee maker and brew it with 4 cups of water and it turned out great.
2645;If you love roses...;This is your tea! It's natural, it's so rosy it will send rose-lovers into a state of ecstasy. Love, love, love it.
2646;Excellent product!;Best dog food out there!  Good ingredients and my dog loves it.  We first started purchasing this dog food at the recommendation of a friend for our miniature schnauzer.
2647;I love these chips!;I first tasted these on a trip to NYC and my wife and I were hooked.  Tough to find them around here and I was thrilled to find them on Amazon.
2648;Read the Ingredient List First;My cat had a severe allergic reaction from this food resulting in deep, crusty, oozing, lesions on his face around his mouth, up to his ears, and down to his neck. On close examination of the ingredients, one unusual additive is sunflower seed oil in this and other Fussie Cat flavors.
2649;#1 Favourite of Skittles;My cat loves Tiki cat, and the flavours in the variety pack are her top favourites. I try to give these to her 1 out of every 4 meals since cats are not supposed to eat a lot of fish.
2650;Great taste and value;Like another reviewer, I can get these at Sam's Club at holiday time, but if I don't stock up I am left buying the outrageously priced little cans at the grocery store the rest of the year. I'm glad I've found another option.
2651;The taste isn't quite right...;I love the product so far - I think it's a great idea, saves money and saves me from carrying heavy bottles up 3 flights of stairs..
2652;reformulated with artificial sweeteners and nasty aftertaste;Their regular and marshmallow now has two artificial sweeteners in it, with the regular sugar and corn syrup.  Now there's a nasty aftertaste.
2653;Kind of Bummed;I just got my order of Belly Flops and was quite disappointed to see that my bag of beans only had 3 flavors of jelly beans, none of which are appealing. It seems as though the worst flavors were chosen and sold for a discount price.
2654;Great food for on the go!;Absolutely love these!  Full of good stuff and easy to toss in your bag for a quick snack.  My only con is that when it is warmer, they are quite sticky and hard to get out of the package.
2655;A++ Service;This is the best drink to have over ice on a hot day..
2656;Works great!;I highly recommend this for anyone having problems with milk supply. It takes about 2 weeks to start working.
2657;Not Loving the taste;Hate to say this but this was a huge yuck factor for me. I used it to help thicken my protein shakes without adding an enormous amount of calories.
2658;Convenience in a tube and no more waste;I have a crock pot recipe that we love, but it calls for 3 tablespoons of tomato paste. I would always end up throwing away the rest of the can of tomato paste.
2659;Lucy's Cinnamon Thins;This is a very flavorful cookie with a nice texture. It is also low in Carb.
2660;Tasty and healthy;These toaster pastries taste, especially when toasted.  I avoid anything with partially hydrogenated vegetable oil, and these fit the bill.
2661;Happy Dogs are here again!;Our dogs were feeling their ages until we began feeding them Happy Hips dog food. Now they feel GREAT! And ordering it from Amazon.
2662;Smoked Sardine Fillets mildly glazed with Maple Syrup -Fabulous!;"<a href=""http://www.amazon."
2663;Heart Racer;"Put your seatbelt on and here we go! Wow, what a great cup of coffee. Real coffee taste, real coffee aroma and a ""kick in the rear"" wake up."
2664;Awesome Taste;I would say this is the best tasting popcorn  have eaten.  It to me is better than movie thearte popcorn.
2665;Melted yet still taste good once separated;This company shipped quickly and packaged item well.  Unfortunately, all of the boxes opened so far, 9 out of 12 have had 1/3 to 1/2 of the chocolates melted in it.
2666;Excellent Product;I usually find these at my local health food store.  It's a great, tasty product, which I think most people would enjoy.
2667;Potent, but not a blend I like;"I am a huge fan of Shirakiku brand shichimi togarashi, but I can't buy it in bags anywhere any more, so I thought I'd try this ""See Smell Taste"" brand.  While this brand does have a lot of flavor and is very fresh, the flavor is overwhelmingly Sichuan pepper, that's pretty much all I can taste with this brand, so I didn't like it at all."
2668;2lb bag rainbow sprinkles;Just as described and pictured.  Rainbow jimmies and the little round sprinkles mixed together.
2669;Wow!;I am always a little unsure about getting coffee online, but this was wonderful.  I look forward every day to my cup (or two or three.
2670;Yogi is the best!!!;"I first tried this after a family member died and I inherited most of her pantry items. I am not a big fan of ""minty"" bedtime teas, but I gave this a try anyway since I had never tried the Yogi brand before."
2671;Hard to find Manhattan Clam Chowder;I live in the southwest where it is near impossible to find Manhattan Clam Chowder. I can't even get stores to order it so this is a great find! Loaded with clams, excellent flavor.
2672;Popcorn lover's dream!;This is the perfect product to get that movie-theater popcorn at home. Everything is in the package all you have to do is open it and put it in the popcorn popper and it makes really great popcorn.
2673;My 3 cats eat it...  guess it's good.;My three cats seem to really like this cat food, although I think they would be happy with any cat food.  Every feeding they act as if I never feed them.
2674;favorite tea;I love this tea.  I have not been able to find it in our local grocery stores anymore.
2675;Great coffee at a great price!;Love this coffee, my wife and I go to New Orleans often and first started drinking Community Coffee while there.  Before finding it on Amazon, we bought it and brought it home.
2676;Hated it!;I tried this product twice and both times it gave me a headache without any added energy. My advice save your money don't even try this product unless you like headaches .
2677;Easy to use;I was giving my pug glucosamine pills, broken in half with his food, so that he won't develop joint problems in the future.  Sometimes he favors one leg.
2678;Lousy waste of money;I wasted my money today on these lousy treats that do nothing and are over priced. I paid 6$ and change for something my cat spit the pill out of and my other cat won't even touch.
2679;Berry flavors, full body and subtle smokiness;"The box says it's ""one of the most sophisticated blends you'll ever enjoy. Borrowing berry flavors from African beans, a full body from Indonesian beans, and a subtle smokiness from a touch of French Roast, this blend represents a spectacular tapestry of flavors carefully woven together."
2680;Good, and just enough to satisfy you.;My family is on the last box.  My oldest daughter ate most of the cookies.
2681;nylabone;I must have ordered a different Nylabone chew than usual..
2682;This is not an ordinary meat treat for pets.;These treats are definitely different.  They are practically weightless, and have an odd texture like a cross between a packing peanut and paperboard, with a dusty exterior.
2683;Petit Beurre Biscuits;Lu Petit Beurre are the best biscuits of their type I have tasted and compare very favorably with the English brands of Petit Beurre. They are crisp and firm and have a great flavor without being too sweet or buttery.
2684;YUMMY;UPDATE_ JULY 2012<br /><br />if you order these in the hot weather months expect to have the suckers mishapen- they harden up again and still unwrap clean- but just incase you didn't know- now you do.<br /><br />LOVE THESE.
2685;Amazing stuff;I love this water and my sons love it, too. They think it the best tasting water they have ever had.
2686;LOVED IT!;I have always loved chai tea but wanted more spice so I always brewed it really strong. This tea is just right and I'm very happy with it.
2687;Habanero Chips.....;When you start one bag..
2688;great training tool;I use these to train my dog.  As others have pointed out, they smell awful.
2689;McCANN'S Steel Cut Irish Oatmeal;This is the best cooked cereal I have ever tried. The nuggets of whole grain are surprisingly delicious.
2690;Great Flour;Great flour for pasta making.  Came as promised in a second bag.
2691;Pomegranate Blueberry Pistachio + Antioxidants;First got turned onto these bars at Starbucks. Our favorite is the blueberry vanilla & cashew but Amazon does not offer this combo for some reason.
2692;Love this Bread!;I love this bread.  Because we live in Canada and Amazon cannot ship this item to Canada, I have to drive to the USA and pick up my order at a postal outlet.
2693;Love Veranda;It's a nice, smooth blend and makes for a great morning cup of joe. I enjoy this every morning while reading the news before going to work.
2694;High quality food but...;I didn't realize this food was ground up into a fine paste (rather than chunks), which my dog doesn't seem to like as much.  It also smells pretty bad.
2695;Great on the run or if you don't have a disposal;I use these b/c I don't have a garbage disposal. I love loose tea but it can be messy to clean up.
2696;My cat love it;My adopted cats will be about 10 years old next year.  I try to give them the best of the best, but they also have medical issues that complicate taste and smell.
2697;Great Variety;I ordered 5 bags and had two of them that were similar, but they still have a lot of variety.  It's amazing how close the shape was to the regular ones.
2698;Best hard candy ever;I happened to fall upon these candies at a little store in Oakland, Oregon and absolutely fell in love with them. The Green Apple and Wild Cherry flavors are by far my favorite.
2699;Almost a 5;I love the can size. I can use one per day rather than covering and refrigerating for the next day.
2700;A long-time favorite;I've been drinking this tea for about a decade now, buying it first at a Russian specialty store in Washington Heights, NYC.  It's similar to Earl Grey in that it's a Bergamot tea, but it has a distinct flavor of its own.
2701;Amazing;I grew up in Cincinnati, OH and have always loved these chips.  I live in Pittsburgh now, and they are not available here.
2702;Sugar Free Bars;I love these bars, especially the cream pnb and the crunch pnb.  I can't eat sugar, and these contain none, so it works well for me.
2703;Not for household consumption;Lavazza Super Crema in this configuration made terrible esspresso, terrible french press, terrible moka pot and the worst (outside of Folgers) drip coffee I've ever paid for.  At $30 per bag on average I thought I'd get a deal with the great reputation and taste of Lavazza that I'd experienced in restaurants and coffee shops.
2704;unbeLIEVably GREAT pasta -- YEAH!!!;This healthier, multigrain pasta has totally transformed my usually whole-wheat-hating husband.  He adores it, preferring it now over his old white pasta, which he'll no longer buy as a substitute even if this isn't available.
2705;CARAMEL DRIZZLE by FOLGERS - YUMMY!;This coffee is wonderful!  Everyone who had a cup enjoyed the flavor.  It was more expensive than other brands, but it is well worth the price.
2706;This chai is sweetened with sucralose (Nutrisweet), which is toxic.;I googled Sucralose and found plenty of research to indicate toxicity.<br /><br />I wish Oregon Chai would make a chai which has no sweetener
2707;Not something I would purchase again;This maybe fine in a smoothie as suggested by another reviewer, I have yet to try that. But as for me, I will not be buying it again.
2708;Tasty Cereal;I live in Po-dunk Wy where there aren't too many gluten free cereals, and this happens to be one of them. Good choice actually, it has a very good flavor and doesn't get soggy, its a bit unnerving buying this as an adult, but it works for me.
2709;Superb Black Tea Blend (Caffeinated);*****<br />Numi Tea's Morning Rise Breakfast Blend Black Tea is a premium Numi tea, both certified organic and kosher. The ingredients are fair trade certified organic Keemun black tea, fair trade certified organic Darjeeling black tea, fair trade certified organic Ceylon black tea, anfair trade certified organic Assam black tea.
2710;ordering the wrong coffee - no image available;I went into K-cups to order K-cups.  This product didn't have an image and I didn't read the product carefully - after all I went into K-cups - why would there be another product in K-cups or why wasn't there an image.
2711;Not good;I ordered the 10 oz crab cakes.  Usually you expect a shell or so, but not in EVERY bite.
2712;Doesn't taste like grass - Hoooray!!!;I bought this because of the other reviews on Amazon and have been very pleased.  Most green teas taste like grass to me.
2713;No identifying packaging;I received a small plastic baggie of crushed, half-melted chocolate rocks. At least I assume they are -- there is no identifying labelling or nutritional information on the packaging at all.
2714;Awesome Taste;Great snack item when you have a sugar craving.  Great to mix with honey or PB or just both of them.
2715;Tasty, Filling, Healthy;I tried all 3 flavors of amazing meal. I didn't like the vanilla chai (unless a big squeeze of chocolate syrup was added).
2716;Tastes like dessert;For licorice lovers only.  Intense licorice flavor and is naturally sweet, so needs no sugar or honey.
2717;good coffee;Purchased this coffee for several months.  Strong enough (I like strong coffee and it is difficult to find it in decaf) and not bitter like many others.
2718;Yummy as in the Name;These candies are very sweet and tasty my friends and co-workers are raiding my stash.  And i will buy these candies again probably not in the variety but in another package.
2719;Excellent;A friend brought me a box for our 3 English Setters and now we're all hooked. I haven't tasted one yet, but they smell wonderful and our dogs love them more than any other treat except chicken sticks, and it's an even tie with those.
2720;BE AWARE;BE AWARE that you only receive 1 jar of sauce, not 4.  The picture of 4 jars is very misleading.
2721;fairly good drink;I tried this one and the kiwi flavor also. This one was a little weak on the tast, but not to where it was undesirable.
2722;Love It! (Well my cats do);I have been purchasing Blue Buffalo indoor cat food for some time now and my cats absolutely love it. I first started them off on Wellness hard food but for some reason it gave one of my cats diarrhea.
2723;Super yummy!;We have a floor standing popcorn machine and tried a few different products before getting this one.  We stopped looking when we got this!  It's the bomb!  We love it and buy it by the case.
2724;A family favorite!;I am a repeat buyer of this particular product, and this last shipment was as good as the previous.  We love this over chicken, as a bruschetta topping, or simply over pasta.
2725;K-Kaps a great inexpensive little item;I have been using these caps constantly for the past 2 weeks and haven't experienced any problems with water leakage, poor fit, etc. The trick I found was to push the cap into the K-Cup so that the top rim of the Kap is even with the top rim of the K-Cup.
2726;Dr Oz recommended!;Dr. Oz recommended fenugreek tea for your digestive track,(not this brand specifically).
2727;Excellent Quality - Best Fruit Club Available;Over the years we have tried fruit clubs from several different vendors.  Golden State is the best value for the money, hands down.
2728;You gotta try these...;Peanuts. These nuts are my favorite nut ever.
2729;INCREDIBLE FLAVOR;I love this salt on popcorn,  and veggies. A few things to know, when you first receive it don't be put off by the intensity of the smell, even with the jar closed you can smell it,.
2730;Deeelicious!!!!;I LOVE licorice and this is the BEST I have found without red dye #5 and blue dye #3.<br /><br />The vines are shorter than with licorice found at Wal-Mart.
2731;Delish!;These were absolutely delicious.  They came very nicely packaged, with a thick and smooth exterior plastic packaging.
2732;Fun and Cool snack;This is a really cool product. For the first part you arn't paying a arm and a leg at the museums.
2733;Okay;I have two dogs.  One dog ate all of it, but he even eats durian fruit.
2734;Holy yum!;I am in awe of this peanut butter. It is seriously delicious.
2735;Melt in Your Mouth Delicious!;"""Bounty"" bars consist of a soft, almost molten center of sweet coconut coated in an outer layer of milk chocolate. You can easily buy them ""over the counter"" here in Australia."
2736;On The Go Oatmeal;I was thrilled to be able to get the Oatmeal To Go Bars in Oatmeal Raisin flavor because I can't buy them in my area.  I can get other flavors but my preference is the Oatmeal Raisin.
2737;Go Country, Go Gravy!;I grew up on a farm where the tradition was gravy at least one meal a day, and in the mornings: hot homemade biscuits with lots of gravy on them. Now, I can make my own gravy, but, why bother when there's Southeastern Mills Old Fashioned Gravy Mix, With Sausage Flavor in easy to open packets I can order from Amazon and have it delivered to my door by my postal carrier! This is my favorite from Southeastern Mills.
2738;My dog choked on the Edible Bone;Warning to other dog owners: the edible Nylabones are extremely dangerous for dogs with a big & greedy appetite.  My dog swallowed it whole within 30 seconds of giving it to her and choked on it.
2739;Safe and Tasty;Our little grandson loves his Gerber Sweet Potato Puffs. Sprinkle some on the table before him and he'll immediately start grabbing for them and putting them in his mouth.
2740;Great rewards for clicker training;"<span class=""tiny""> Length:: 1:42 Mins<br /><br /></span>I have been clicker training Bella, a toy Yorkshire Terrier, for about 3 years.  Now that she has a baby sister (Bleu, a miniature Blue Heeler) I started to look for a new type of treat to help reinforce the training."
2741;Great HARD Pretzels;My family loves these pretzels and the $24 dollar price from Amazon warehouse is the cheapest way to get them.<br />Things to expect:<br />- Only about 1/2 the pretzels are unbroken in any box but the taste is unaffected.
2742;Best chicken marinade ever!!!;We absolutely love the flavor of Weber's White Wine & Herb marinade.  The flavors are so delicious, we always get many compliments from friends and family.
2743;Daily Breakfast Coffee;This coffee is bold enough to get one started in the morning.  Two cups is robust enough to kick start your system and the taste is outstanding.
2744;My dog loves them;Great product.  My dog loves the bones and they come in a ziplock bag inside the box.
2745;Great alternative to traditional popsicles/ice cream treats!;I was looking for something more natural than traditional frozen treats for my kids to enjoy during the summer, and found Smooze on Amazon and had to try it.  Overall, they are pretty fantastic.
2746;Second to None;No Fear is a superior taste, and clean energy. I've been hooked on it since 2006.
2747;Popchips Sweet Potatoe;Love the taste.  They are low in calories and better than other chips.
2748;Gluten Free Pantry Decadent Chocolate Cake Mix;This is an excellent product, just as described. Soooo delicious and moist.
2749;Feed my two dogs only Wellness brand. Consistently on top ten canned dog food lists;Had my big noble boy dog, who had been with me for ten years, die of Cancer recently. He was a animal shelter rescue (As all my pets have been, and are.
2750;Love This Stuff...;I order 2 of these at a time and get the free shipping. Coconut Oil is really good for your health and well being.
2751;A delicious cocoa mix;We made batches of hot chocolate for the people walking down our street looking at the neighborhood Christmas lights. Everyone loved it.
2752;The most delicious.;This is definitely the best packaged tuna product on the market.  The flavor is superior.
2753;Good Bulgogi Sauce;I have lived in and visited Korea off and on for the last 20 years.<br /><br />I have been cooking Korean food (over 100 recipes) during that time.
2754;So Good, I eat it straight from the Jar!;I have ordered several jars of Cacao Bliss. I have yet to try an Arisana product that i did not like.
2755;Excellent French Roast;Fresh and aromatic with full-bodied French Roast character. Works well both as an espresso and as a brewed coffee.
2756;Great Tea;This is very good Japanese Green Tea.  It is unsweetened and is very refreshing served cold.
2757;A good substitute for wheat pasta.;For all those on a wheat-free/gluten-free diet.This pasta has a texture, not unlike wheat pasta.
2758;Buenisimo;I love la slamandra dulce de leche and it is super hard to find here in the states. It is the only brand that I will buy so tip  of the hat for carrying the product and speedy service.
2759;As good as it says on the box;"I am on a diet and needed something suited to substitute the daily ""sweets"" I yearn for on an everyday basis.  Whenever I am in a mood to munch on a snack, I take one of these gums one of my favorites especially considering I have not been able to find it in any local supermarket or convenience store, and it satisfies my taste buds."
2760;Good Stuff but...;We rececived our 50 flavor jelly bellies this week and boy do they taste good. The reason for this has to be because they use natural ingredients to create the flavors.
2761;Hot Cocoa for a long time;Swiss Miss Hot Cocoa  (diet) is a staple in our house and now we have plenty of it  with our every month plan.  We love it,  Can invite the whole neighborhood in for a cup of cocoa.
2762;Happy whiskers and two paws way up!;*Note to Amazon.com,<br /><br />Pretty please put this Liver on Subscribe and Save! You have the beef & liver and the beef available for S&S but not the Liver yet.
2763;great taste;great taste, but too expensive. I mix the coconut water with my protein shakes in the mourning, good stuff.
2764;Go Caribou!;OK, so I'm a high school English teacher and a total Caribou addict.  There is not one in my city, but whenever I travel to Minneapolis, I hit a Caribou at least three times a day.
2765;Love it or Hate it;It seems by all of the 1 star reviews, this is a Love it or Hate it soup.  I happen to love this soup.
2766;Great Bar;I never eat bars but I do a lot of weight loss programs with hypnosis for clients so I bought a bar in every flavor to taste assuming I would not like it. A friend does marketing for a protein bar and had me taste it and it was inedible!! To my surprise, I thought they were delicious and now recommend it to my clients.
2767;May be healthy but they taste awful.;I love peaches and I am willing to pay higher prices for healthy snacks.  These had the higher price but they did not taste like peaches at all.
2768;Excellent puppy food;I bought this dog food because it receives Dog Food Advisor's highest rating. My dog enjoys it--she can be finicky.
2769;Nice Tea;If you like English Breakfast tea there is absolutely nothing wrong with this blend. It is aromatic and flavorful.
2770;Coffee tastes good, not great;The coffee is not quite as strong as I had hoped, but it is pretty good. Sometimes the pod gets stuck in the puncture pin and is hard to get off, but I knew that they might not be 100% compatible.
2771;Great for giving to the kids but better to keep for yourself!;These suckers are yumalicious! We bought 10 pounds of them to pass out on Halloween. We already knew we liked them, sweet and sour fuit yum yum, so we were pleased to pass them out on Halloween.
2772;Product of USA, China and Europe;I like to know where my food is coming from.  Who knows where these are from, since they barely tell you.
2773;I agree with P. Lucas;These things are NOTHING like Oreos.You think wow Oreos.
2774;Better Delivery;We only waited one week for 2 cases.<br />The cans were not in the best shape, though.
2775;Not too Coco-nutty and not too mango-ey;This is the most delicious and refreshing coconut water I have tasted so far. I love drinking it after I work out because it has as much potassium as a bananna.
2776;Sensation: liquid fruit cocktail, better than other aloe chunk drinks;The flavor was fine, like bright crisp apple juice with hint of green tea, sweet but not too sweet.  However, I didn't like the sensation of little soft bits of sweet stuff in my drink.
2777;Coleus Plants;This is a beautiful and sturdy plant that is very easy to grow.  The problem I had with it the first time around was the frost that hit California during Winter.
2778;Excellent Shirataki Option;I've tried many brands, types, and shapes of Shirataki noodles. This is actually up there with some of my favorites.
2779;These have proven TOXIN!;Please be aware that these bars have ALFALFA that has a proven Toxin (L-canavanine: this is an analog of an amino-acid that 'tricks' your body into forming dysfunctional DNA!). When studied in monkeys (they will not dare study this in people, even though there have been many case reports), ALFALFA is a toxin that INDUCES LUPUS!!! Beware! Why do these natural companies put bad ingredients in their products!?  Dr.
2780;Much love for One Love Coffee;This product has a surprise taste and I truly wonder why nobody has thought of this before.  It's the best of both coffee and tea in one infusion.
2781;Disappointing;This tea lacks the distinctive Scottish breakfast tea malt flavor. It is not bad, but no better than much less expensive teas.
2782;Good Coffee Treat - Recommended;"These Green Mountain ""Caramel Vanilla Cream"" K-Cups make good tasting coffee, with noticeable but not overpowering caramel and vanilla flavors. These make a nice alternative to to our regular coffee (<a href=""http://www."
2783;Very pepperminty and long lasting flavor;This is a super minty gum and the hint of ginseng flavor makes it a little more interesting than the average peppermint gum. I like that it's sugar free and has Xylitol added, which helps reduce cavities.
2784;Just what I needed;I've loved these gummi bears since I was a kid! I used to buy 3lb bags at my local Target, but they stopped carrying them. I'm so happy to be able to get them in this quantity.
2785;They LOVE it!;I purchased the variety pack at first to see which flavor my cat likes or dislikes.  Out of the 4 flavors (Venison, Beef, Duck, and Chicken & Turkey) this flavor (Duck) was by far their favorite!  As soon as I put it down it's almost gone.
2786;An abomination unto the lord. . .;It is appalling to me that anyone would produce this product and sell it as food. What's more appalling is that people eat it and not only support the misguided notion that this is something that could be considered food, but even go so far as to say that they ENJOY eating it, AND DO SO ON A REGULAR BASIS.
2787;dogs love em, so does the post office....;If you really want to give your dog a treat, get some of these.<br />If my dogs had opposing thumbs I could get them to help me paint if I promised they could have a couple of these afterwards.
2788;CHANGE OF PACE;It seemed like our dogs were getting tired of the same old thing for dinner, so I did some research and found this Wellness brand dog food. What I liked about it was the lack of by-products and cereals.
2789;Fantastic!;This is EXTREMELY better than Wilton!!!  Buy this and never use that nasty stuff again.  This is actually edible, unlike products and is very easy to work with.
2790;OMG this stuff is so good!;If you like Asian food, and you like it HOT, this is just the ticket for you.<br />Also good in curries and cajun dishes.
2791;too instant tasting;I did not like this coffee. At the beginning I thought I was ordering kcups.
2792;Stash has always delivered in quality tea.;We have purchased several different black teas from Stash and have yet to be dissapointed in their products.  Several of their black teas are such favorites with our family and friends that we placed them on an automatic reorder.
2793;Horsetail Grass Tea;Too early to know.  I was recommended that this product helps out the joints.
2794;sticky toffee pudding;I have had sticky toffee puddings in both Britain and the United States. This particular brand makes without a doubt the WORST I have ever had.
2795;Not the same;A couple of year ago I bought Fiesta Seasoning Uncle Chris' Gourmet Steak seasoning.  It was great.
2796;Wild flowers;Purchased these for a drainage ditch on the edge of our lawn.  They are sprouting fine.
2797;Great candy alternative;Great tasting fruit snack. As others have commented, it is somewhat on the sweet side, but it is still better than corn syrup and hydrogenated oil filled candy bars.
2798;high-potency taste at good value;Saccharin wouldn't be my first choice sweetener based on taste alone, hence the 1 less star, but value-for-strength in taste, this product beats all other non-calorie sweeteners I've tried. Sucralose tastes better in my opinion (less bitter), but is way more expensive, and typically only packets are sold, not tablets.
2799;Great flavor!;First tried this on a cruise and liked out so much that we looked it up online when we got home. Great product, good price, fast shipping.
2800;Very Yummy;I haven't eaten any, but if I was a dog, I bet I would love them.  My dog goes crazy for this little treats.
2801;Good Tea;We use this tea in our office and it's very popular.  Makes a nice cup of tea.
2802;Cheaper with shipping, but not as good as the other brand;I decided to try this brand because it was cheaper as a bulk amount with shipping than Por Kwan. Also, I wanted to at least try it and see how it compared.
2803;Delicious, but one is not enough;Being diabetic, I am always looking for snacks that have low carbohydrates.  Generally for diabetes they recommend 15-30 carbs per snack.
2804;Our cats no longer will touch any of it.;We are involved with cat rescue, and prefer to give canned, no-grain food.  Between ours and the ones we're fostering until we find them homes, we have 43 cats.
2805;Robost and Sweet! Odd Yet Delicious Combination;I knew I was in for a taste pleasure roller coaster and I was not disappointed when I was just brewing.<br /><br />My tastebuds began to water.
2806;Suggested by Dr. Oz;This tea was suggested by Dr. Oz on his show about how to sleep better.
2807;Only for the youngest of puppy teething;I got this for my Pomeranian puppy when I first brought him home (8 weeks 1.7 lbs).
2808;Porterhouse Seasoning;I really like this product for one of my favorite fish recipes and can no longer find it in the local stores.  I was very pleased to find it on line.
2809;Dog doesn't like them;My maltipoo is pretty picky with food and treats and she absolutely hates these treats. I've tried offering them to her and she won't eat it.
2810;Disappointed and downright angry;"I ordered popcorn on September 7 and delivery continues to be postponed.  The company will not allow me to cancel, claiming the order is ""being prepared for delivery."
2811;Excellent Cocoa powder;I bought 3 packages. Just made chocolate Ice Cream tonight using this Cocoa powder.
2812;One and Only;I highly recommend it.<br /><br />I didn't really drink tea, until about six months ago.
2813;Cat fod;It is hard to reviuew catfood since my cat does not talk.  But she eats it so it must be good.
2814;Delicious but not that strong;I'm on a quest for the boldest k-cup coffee..
2815;Great idea, such a pain to open and close;The reviews on this are so true. Great idea, but such a pain to pop the clear lid off from the side, even once I figured it out.
2816;back to nature oatmeal cookies;Back to nature cookies are great cookies to buy ..
2817;Like Green Water;I tried this because I can't seem to find the Gloria Jean Serenity Tea which I liked very much.  The Celestial Seasonings was very very bland.
2818;Tea;What do I really know about tea?<br /><br />I'm sure there are some experts out there, but I'm your average, run of the mill shlub. Normally I drink my tea iced, but over the last few weeks with b'fast, I've been having hot tea in the morning.
2819;satisfied;Big League Chew Sour Apple 12 Pack Box  I was happy with the service I recieved..
2820;The Hotness;I have to say, these were not as hot as I thought they would be. I crushed them up and put them on everything as if they were plain red pepper flakes.
2821;Great food for cats;My two cats love Science Diet. Only problem is I wish they would have a picture of the food on the outside of the bag.
2822;Good product and shipped fast;Super saver shipping had these to me in 3 days.  Good product too, they taste great and were very fresh.
2823;great add on for Tassimo;If you have a Tassimo, I recommend this.  It looks great and is convenient.
2824;It tastes great!!!;I just used this product for the first time, I think it tastes great..
2825;AMAZING!;Yeah, this gopher trap is pretty amazing!<br /><br />I have a terrible gopher infestation and I had been using the wire Macabee style traps for about two months. I had been using the Macabee traps exactly as instructed but the success rate was very low with them.
2826;BEEFEATER PACK OF 12;THIS IS NOT A PACK OF 12 BUT OF 3. I AM VERY UNHAPPY.
2827;Euclyptus chips;We love these chips. They were a childhood favorite and then we were not able to find them for a very long while.
2828;awesome;I got my hot sauce just in time for christmas and i got free samples along with it which is great for i am always interested in trying new things. the hot sauce itself is exactly as i remember it hot!!!!! i got it as a gag gift for my dad who is obsessed with hot stuff.
2829;Great taste, but not worth the $$;I love most of Crystal Light's flavors, and the new Green Teas are among them.  They taste different from many of the powdered mixes out there - those usually have funny aftertastes, while the Crystal Light versions have a nice hint of fruit and lack the chemical flavor.
2830;Some of the best sodas.;My guess is that the other reviewer has only had sodas filled with chemicals, so when one that isn't comes around it tastes strange to them. Really though, I'm a big fan of natural brewed sodas like this.
2831;Best for the money;This is the best chocolate
2832;Flavorful Change;"If you're looking for a flavorful change from boring bitter coffee this is perfect. Full of smooth body rich flavor from the first sip, this finishes with a great coffee taste without a bitter or ""too strong"" ending."
2833;Remember to soak;Some people said these were fishy.  I took a chance after reading just remember to soak for 15 minutes.
2834;Much better price than in the stores;Its difficult to find these decaf Via on sale.  My wife likes them so I ordered the box of 50 at significant savings.
2835;the best yet;As for the merchant: Fast and  efficient, and accurate.  No hassle.
2836;Delicious, crunchy, low calorie, low fat;These crackers are absolutely delicious. Head over to Sesmark's website to get an idea.
2837;Love this stuff!;Great product, received in a timely fashion.  Not to heavy, doesn't sit on the skins surface.
2838;The perfect European-style spread.;Hero black current is one of the stars of my morning routine. The current pieces in the spread are not too thick, but not too skimpy - a bit reminiscent of lingonberry.
2839;Grove Square Hot Chocolate;This Hot chocolate tasted very good!  The whole family liked it!!!  It is a nice change to make Hot Chocolate instead of coffee inthe Keurig coffee maker.  We wold purchase this again.
2840;Best Popcorn Ever;I bought this popcorn as a gift for some dear friends. The have commented back several times that it's the best popcorn they have ever had.
2841;Good and Healthy Too;My dog loves this food. I feel good giving it to him knowing that meat is always the first ingredient and it is packed with things he needs (and no corn!).
2842;Tender Pop Hulless Popcorn Kernels 2 Lbs;This product is good, but a bit pricey. It is as advertised though! I personally would not pay that much again.
2843;Green Salsa Verde;Good product made with natural ingredients. Not my favorite flavor, I prefer a red salsa - tomato base and a little more spice.
2844;GREAT COFFEE;ESPECIALLY AS WE GET OLDER, THE LINING OF OUR STOMACH GETS MORE SENSITIVE TO HARSH CHEMICALS AND SUBSTANCES.  LOW ACID COFFEE IS A COMMON SENSE SUBSTITUTE THAT LOSES NO AROMA OR TASTE IN THE PROCESS.
2845;Yummy.......and good for you (well, better than some other stuff);Trying to break the frito habit, I tried veggie chips.  Really yummy and no greasy aftertaste.
2846;Excellent!  The only one I will use.;I have tried others (some of which I have bought in Chinatown) but this is the ONLY spicy garlic sauce I will use.  It is absolutely wonderful and I use it in and on everything.
2847;quality control snafu;Received a 12 can case of these tomatoes yesterday. Several cans were dented.
2848;Pill Pockets are brilliant - I wish I had invented them;We have 2 dogs that take pills twice a day every day. And now they take them with no fuss at all - they actually come over when they hear their pill boxes.
2849;Wasa Crispbread, Multi Grain, 9.7-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 12);The ONLY way for me to buy them anymore!  They worked out to be 2.00 or so<br />a package.
2850;Twizzlers -- time to retire;Although I love gourmet black licorice -- salty, chewy, sweet, hard, you name it -- I confess I also go for strawberry Twizzlers. You know you are basically eating plastic when you eat a Twizzler, but they have their appeal.
2851;Discovering Sardines? Try these!;Mild flavor. Excellent quality.
2852;Falls short of a dark chocolate experience.;Looks like they didn't really taste test this product.  Nothing in the realm of dark chocolate springs to mind when drinking it.
2853;Helped me get her weight down;These chew sticks keep my dog's teeth pretty clean between cleanings.  That's what they're supposed to do.
2854;OK but wrong shape;I had assumed these would be shaped like rods to enable a baby to easily hold them - they are in fact shaped like regular cookies, two inches in diameter, and our grandson is still unable to grasp them.  Their content seems to be fine, but until his fine-motor skills improve they won't be very helpful.
2855;Pot roast nirvana;Excellent prep product for pot roast, beef stew, etc.<br />I like it better than bullion cubes.
2856;A pretty good deal;This is less a review of Yogourmet's freeze dried starter and more of a clarification of the value.  I mean, how much is there to say about a starter? It either works or it doesn't.
2857;Sbux Pikes Place K-cups;This is my husbands favorite coffee for the Keurig. Finally after MONTHS of testing.
2858;HOT COFFEE;WHILE BARISTA ITALIAN ROAST COFFEE IS A BIT PRICIER THAN MOST OF THE KEURIG'S STYLE COFFEES, IT HAS A GREAT RICH FLAVOR AND IS WORTH IT.<br /><br />BY ACCIDENT, I RAN A SECOND CUP OF WATER THROUGH THE KEURIG ON A PREVIOUSLY USED K-CUP.
2859;This Chocolate Is Good For You;Too many Americans know of chocolate only from the bars appearing in most food stores. Those bars are of inferior quality, so I determined to spend a little extra to see if I could tell the difference.
2860;Beautiful fragrance, Wonderful flavor;I really love this tea!  The fragrance is strong and beautiful. The tea itself is a flavorful medium bodied tea.
2861;Smooth;Love, love the Natucket Blend in the morning, afternoon, actually anytime.  Just wish it came in larger packs, as I feel like I need to limit.
2862;Not for Sensitive Skin - Read Ingredients First;I love the Alba products because they contain lots of natural ingredients and are a great value for the price, plus I've always had good resutls with them.  I use the sea kelp products and really like them but decided to try something different for the summer, so I ordered the Jasmine moisturizer and the hibiscus facial toner.
2863;My dogs LOVE these !;Willy, my 14 pound poodle and Gracie my 15 pound Carin terrier both love these everlasting treat balls. We purchased them each their own medium size ball.
2864;Terrible new version of what was a good product;"It is always a huge disappointment when a product that you have relied on for years destroys its merits in search of a new image. Cytomax has ruined a good product with the ""remake"" it has imposed on its product line."
2865;Horrible Supply Chain and order picking;Ordered this for a party as a favor and they sent regular olive oil instead of infused. Got with cusstomer service who rushed an order again.
2866;Right product, on time delivery;Quite possibly the best brownie mix money can buy.  I was a little hesitant about buying groceries on amazon, but have to say I am very happy with the outcome.
2867;Daily Indulgence;I absolutely love this tea.  I have it every evening after supper.
2868;I received the Chinese version - update;Made the effort to locate the Euro version of Maggi, which this product description specifically calls out.  When it arrived, it was the China version with the yellow cap.
2869;High Quality Food;My two cats love this food!  I normally buy the chicken and the beef/chicken formulas and have been using it ~ 2 yrs now.  High quality ingredients with no corn or preservatives are a priority for me since my cats previously had issues with allergies and dander.
2870;Makes a wonderful and different sort of dish.;This is actually quite a nice blend of spices for your bead, squash and corn chili.  I must admit that mine is better, but having a few packages of this stuff around does save time and does, in the long run, save money.
2871;Extra Virgin Olive Oil;"<a href=""http://www.amazon."
2872;Green mountain is the best;Love the half caff k cups. I like the auto delivery plan.
2873;Best spicy mustard, unbeatable price;I go through a lot of spicy mustard. I use it on sandwiches, sausages, and pretty much anything else.
2874;My pup loves it!;Like all the other Zuke products that I buy, this one is excellent quality. My pup loves it.
2875;Lots of great flavors here;This was my first experience with chutney, and I can only hope the rest I try are as good as this one. I was told that a large chain organic grocer (TFM) that makes a pork and brie sandwich used this mango chutney.
2876;Doggy Likes!;My 10 lbs chihuahua/doxie mix is a picky eater.  He isn't motivated by food at all, and it's always a trial and error when it comes to trying out a new treat.
2877;One of my favorite teas;We really enjoy using our Keurig to make tea and Bigelow packages some excellent teas in the K-cup format.  The Pomegranate Green Tea is one of my favorites.
2878;Not as it was described;I cook with French gray sea salt all the time.  I bought this particular salt because of the description as 'gray French Sea Salt'  It neither is gray nor does it feel like Gray French Sea Salt, which is moist.
2879;Lemony ...;Very good lemony flavor.  Amazing how good this tea is without having to be seeped for several minutes.
2880;Nice tasting mild coffee;Usually, I'm a fan of a very deep, dark roasted coffee, with a full-bodied, smooth flavor. This coffee is a very deep flavored mild bodied coffee.
2881;Still a cinnamon tea, but not as overpowering as in Stash's Organic Chai Black & Green Tea;This is a very pleasant green tea. The cinnamon is fairly dominant but counterbalanced quite well by the green tea flavor, even though Stash did use cinnamon oil.
2882;Best Chips in the U.S.;I have lived in many parts of the Untied States and have found Wachusett BBQ chips to be the best tasting chip I have ever had. I am so happy that I can purchase these chips online.
2883;Taste Great and Sugar Free;These are great! All of their flavors have great real fruit flavor, they're moist and it's tough to eat just one.<br /><br />Such an awesome alternative to the traditional sugar included cereal bars.
2884;Best & Simpliest Salad seasoning;This salad seasoning is so simple but extremely tasty.  It enhances the salad as it's not too over-powering.
2885;Love the taste!!!;This is my favorite Nissin Chow Mein. Someone said that it was too spicy, but you do not have to add the whole packet of spices.
2886;Dog doesn't like them;My maltipoo is pretty picky with food and treats and she absolutely hates these treats. I've tried offering them to her and she won't eat it.
2887;FAVORITE HOT COCOA!;"This is the absolute best hot cocoa for the Keurig Brewers. All of the other Hot Cocoa's that we have tried we had to ""doctor"" to make them taste good."
2888;Found Fiber;Great way to up daily fiber intake.  Taste is great, and I've always been a Mini Wheat fan.
2889;Addictive;I have four cats.  One cat is totally addicted to this treats - she is ridiculous about it.
2890;New formula;My dogs have been on Canidae for the past several years and even the picky dog who has lost over half her teeth loved it.  However, I recently bought a new bag of Canidae.
2891;Inedible & gross...;Salty and rank with an inedible flavor and a mushy, slimy texture. I couldn't even finish the first can and I had 23 more to do.
2892;sent it back, it was horrible.;I usually buy a different brand of full leaf tea. I tried this Mighty Leaf for a change and couldn't get past the funky taste.
2893;Top notch service - Super product;I first contacted this company by email prior to placing an order and was astounded to receive a full and friendly reply within minutes. I still had one question which I had forgotten to ask so sent another email.
2894;Pods are not K-cups;I thought I was ordering K-cups since I found this listing in an Amazon e-mail to me about K-cups. The mistake was unfortunate and Amazon made it right by issuing an immediate refund.
2895;Good quality;This purchased was well package, arrived undamaged and in a timely manner. The product was the best solid white albacore tuna I have ever had.
2896;My favorite tea!;When you add cream to this tea as far as I'm concerned it beats any kind or flavor of coffee you can ever find. It makes an excellent after dinner drink or anytime of the day drink and is much more soothing with less caffeine than coffee.
2897;These are incredible!;"Found these at a ""close-out"" type store a few months ago, and as we often do, like to take a chance on weird snacks. Since I have trouble eating regular popcorn due to the hulls getting stuck in my teeth, I thought this might be a good way to get my popcorn fix."
2898;Love the idea, can't stand the smell!;My dog and I both love Zuke's.  The mini naturals are great for training because they are small but super flavorful.
2899;Didn't realize it was for African Amer hair.;I purchased this not realizing it's intended audience is for African American hair types, I have straight white girl hair.  There were no directions and it didn't wash out easily
2900;Great Coffee at a Very Reasonable Price;A very good coffee -The dark roast makes a very bold, strong cup of coffee without being bitter.  I actually mix the dark and regular roast beans 1:1 to get the flavor I want.
2901;Best green tea I have found;I have tried many different green teas, different brands, various flavors.  This is the best tasting green tea I have found.
2902;Amazon Addictive Treats;These Bequet Celtic Sea Salt Caramels are so good, you can't eat just one! It is a perfect dessert - satisfying but not overly sweet. I had eaten something similar in Europe but was unable to find them here.
2903;My dog loves these;These are well priced and it is a bonus when your dog absolutely loves the treat.<br />They last a while too.
2904;Light and delicious;These are little airy and delicious nuggets of goodness..
2905;Tasty, healthy, good price.;I love almonds in general, and this particular brand is quite good.  They taste great, with just the right amount of salt and oil (for me, anyway).
2906;palacinta or hungarian pancakes;I have been looking everywhere for a prune filling for my palacinta and finally found Solo prune/plum filling at Amazon!<br />It's the best prune filling yet. It is very moist and fresh in the can and the right<br />consistancy and sweetness.
2907;Great nutritional profile, tastes good with orange tea;These are made with mostly air and egg white and have a fantastic nutritional profile for bodybuilders and people losing weight or maintaining a weight loss.  I've lost 160 lbs through diet and exercise and like the reviewer who had surgery, I don't want to eat the amount of sugar found in normal meringues.
2908;Good Cereal;Erewhon crispy brown rice cereal is good.<br />I think it tastes just like Rice Krispy cereal.
2909;Healthy Candy Bar!;Of all the KIND bars (and I've had them all) this one will hit the spot if you're craving the taste and texture of caramel and nuts. What's nice is that the fat content is relatively low for something that really can qualify as a comfort snack, while the nuts and other unprocessed goodies will give you sustained energy and the important OMGA-3.
2910;ginger;whew..
2911;Good price and good value....;I was very please with the accuracy in the description.Prompt mailing.
2912;Great xBold Coffee, Horrible Price;$27 for 18 Kcups?!? Really? Go to Target or the grocery store and spend $9 (or buy three for the $27 and get 54 cups). It is really good if you want really bold coffee.
2913;Great Way to Start the Day;We are both over 60, my husband and I.  He loves a smart healthy breakfast before he hits the golf links four days a week.
2914;Nice and smooth.;I've tried numerous K-Cups before, and am more of a medium roast drinker.  This coffee has been very consistent (bought it numerous times), and has a smooth flavor.
2915;they are a little bit too delicious for me!;i had to order another 2 42 ounce bags today. the others i purchased at amazon did not last very long unfortunately.
2916;Best for my dog, K-9 first responders use this;I researched for the healthiest, least filler type food.  I live in the Washington, DC area where there are lots of police K-9 dog owners.
2917;My absolute favorite tea - and it is all natural;Delicious! My favorite tea, and I am a connoisseur who spends plenty at tea boutique Teavana, but this is the BEST! The ingredients on my packaging do state there are natural flavors, not artificial. My Trader Joe's stopped carrying this because they said it was too expensive, but at $2.
2918;sweet!;sweet for me: best sugar around. sweet for the farmer: i buy fairtrade whenever i can.
2919;Good!!;This is such good stuff, and it's quite healthy. It contains plenty of trace nutrients as well which are vital to our everyday functions, such as eukronium and phosphoric acid.
2920;Not bad for powdered milk!;First of all, let me say that I consider myself a milk connoisseur.  I can easily tell the difference between skim, 2%, and whole milk.
2921;WOW...Magic noodes are indeed MAGIC!;I reluctantly bought these noodles after ready many reviews..
2922;K-Cups not properly sealed - coffee all over inside of box;I was surprised when I opened the box and found that some of the K-Cups were not properly sealed.  Coffee was spilled all through the inside of the box and some of the K-Cups were obviously unusable.
2923;Good value;This is a good product. Our dogs love it.
2924;Unremarkable;First, let me say that I prefer extra-bold K-Cup coffees and only occasionally drink a medium blend, and never decaf. I bought three Wolfgang Puck coffees several months ago: Rodeo Drive Blend
2925;Are you serious?;$73 for a tin of Earl Grey, even if it's Ahmad (my favorite)? I buy excellent loose Ahmad tea for around $8.00, so pray tell me what justifies this price? (And I've smelled - not drunk - rare Chinese tea that was going for $1000/100 grams).
2926;Light, fruity and absolutely delicious;My husband and I bought this tea to give away as favors at our wedding. We purchased the inital stock through Teavana and found it to be very expensive (almost $10 an ounce!) However, we searched Amazon and found the Rishi brand for nearly half the cost! I love that the tea arrives sealed in tins for freshness.
2927;tasty Maybe beneficial;My midwife recommended this product, and I drank it throughout my second and third trimesters. My labor was slow, but I experienced nothing you might really call pain (pressure and some discomfort) all the way to 9 centimeters.
2928;YUMMY!!!;These bars are so good!!!  They really do taste like coconut cream pie and are so good for you!  I love that they taste so good and my kids love them..
2929;Yummy and vegan;I'm not sure whether I appreciate the organic peanut butter or the vegan chocolate more, but it is a great combination.  After buying Dark Chocolate Dreams I'm starting to realize that almost anything that I use peanut butter for tastes better with chocolate too.
2930;Thumbs down;"I felt that this was an intersteing product but I was led to believe from previous reviews that the packaging was ""great"" and there was ""so much candy"". I felt that this WAS NOT the case."
2931;Great blend;Good brew - very low acid. Great service and price.
2932;love love love these cakes;Cant get enough of these delicious cakes!  Arrive very fresh and very fast.Reminds me of being back on the island.
2933;I LOVE the Black Cherry and the Black!;Yummy, chewy, filled with flavor in every bite.  I've also had the Green Apple and while good, not quite as satisfying.
2934;Cacao bits;It's good if you want no sugar at all.<br /><br />They don't melt and are bitter if you use too much.
2935;Wonderful Tea.;The tea helped me tremendously with getting a more restful sleep.  I do however, think you should take it when you know you have more time to sleep in.
2936;Real ingredients not listed;The real ingredients is not listed by amazon. After buying the product, I found that it contains Tuna oil (source of DHA).
2937;Excellent Product;This product is very good smells very nice like Professional Groomers use. ITem came quickly.
2938;Really good Decaf;Later in the day when watching my caffeine intake, this coffee hits the spot.  All the cups I have made have been delicious.
2939;Great product, great value!;This is a great all natural product for that on the go person who needs protein in a hurry and a nice energy boost.  Larger drink than most of the comparable drinks on the market for the same money.
2940;Gone quickly;I can't give an objective review of these.  I bought them for my kids and they vanished quickly.
2941;Our Dog loves them - but watch out please read;Great treat for our Airedale who chomps them down..
2942;Very disappointed;"Looked forward to this ""special rare"" tea as I've enjoyed the regular TH Assam in the past, but this one is completely tasteless. Like drinking hot water with milk & sugar."
2943;Rusted Cans;We have purchased Westbrae Organic Cut Green Beans in the past and they are very good. We, recently, purchased two cases from Amazon for over $50.
2944;good;Item shipped fast. Taste delicious.
2945;The BEST Dog Treat Ever;My Mini Poodle won't eat any dog treats. I have wasted hundreds of dollars.
2946;Great chilis;I will order again from this company when I need more.  Everything was as stated.
2947;Great Idea for Dispensing Dog Treats;Really like the idea of a roller-ball to give treats, especially as rewards when training (skateboard, leash walking and close commands).  The dispenser is similar to a roll-on deodorant design.
2948;GREAT FRENCH ROAST - smooth and tastier;This french roast has a more easy delicious french roast flavor and thankfully it lacks that burnt black as heck flavor that some french roast can have that is over powering. I like this and I love lots of dark roast coffees and this one is great.
2949;Best ever;"This kcup gets some odd reviews but I must say it is by far the best ""quickie"" I have had. I either make my own latte at home the old fasshioned way or I throw in one of these in the brewer when I am in a hurry."
2950;WONDERFUL!;This is the best tea I have ever had.  It is richer and more full bodied then say a cup of lipton.
2951;Different!;Beautiful pearlescent colors-festive for Easter and springtime..
2952;Water with Lime Essence;
2953;Best tasting rose hips tea;The rose hips combine with the hibiscus to create one of the best-tasting teas out there. I could drink this tea every day.
2954;Simple Preparation of Tasty Dish;In 20 minutes, in a pot with a lid on a conventional stove, this tasty<br />rice/noodle/vegetable dish can be prepared simply by following directions<br />on the package.  Complement to chicken or good by itself.
2955;COFFEE!;Jet Fuel. And that it is.
2956;Allday Energy;Pretty good product.  The taste isn't the best but it's definitely not the worse either.
2957;NO CUSTOMER SERVICE AT ALL!!!! IGNORE MY CANCEL REQUEST!!;IDIOT. I TOLD YOU TWICE I WANT TO CANCEL THE ORDER.
2958;Refreshing Fruit Beverage;My husband and I love Izze sparkling juices, especially the sparkling Blackberry. It is refreshing anytime, especially on a hot day.
2959;pretty bland;I did not like these crackers. The cheddar flavor was barely there and there was a weird aftertaste.
2960;Bold Great Taste!;This is a favorite in the office and in my house. We burn through this coffee.
2961;Far from the best Hazlenut coffee I've tried;"I noticed a ""different"" aroma when the box arrived.  Hazlenut is my favorite flavor but I felt this flavor was not as good as other Hazlenut blends."
2962;Best brownies EVER!!;I'm a huge fan of anything Ghirardelli! But I refuse to pay $4+ per box at the regular supermarket!! So glad I found these on Amazon. These are hands-down the best brownies I've ever had.
2963;Yum;These are better than the Special K things. These actually taste like potato (because they are potato).
2964;Great meal-on-the-go!;Hunger--at least in my experience--makes me fairly useless. Sometimes I just can't stop to eat, but don't like the feeling of low blood sugar.
2965;way too salty;I know others like salt more than I do but I am not on a salt free diet or anything like that.  I love sausage but this was way too salty for my taste.
2966;I think this coffe has changed recently;We used to drink this all the time. It was a great coffee.
2967;A Decent Diet Cool Whip...It is not marshmellow dip...;I have tried two the Walden diet food products and so far.  I have tried the chocolate dip<br />and the marshmellow dip.
2968;Too strong at full strength;Unfortunately, I made the mistake of emptying the contents into a coffee cup without coming here first to see if it needed watered down more.  The taste was way too strong using a 1 packet to 1 cup ratio for me.
2969;Hands down the BEST tea I've ever had!;"Pros:<br />1- Tastes great hot or cold<br />2- Universally enjoyed (kids, adults, non-green tea drinkers)<br />3- Mild and smooth<br />4- Good sweet with cream (like Chai)or plain<br /><br />Cons:<br />1- can get bitter if you leave the teabag in too long<br />2- It didn't magically melt 50 lbs of fat off my body<br /><br />We use this at home for ""water"" - we make batches using five tea bags in 2 quarts of water - in our microwave for 7 minutes and let it steep for another 15-20 minutes.  Then we pour it into a gallon jug, and add water to make one gallon of ""iced"" tea that we keep in the refrigerator."
2970;Splendid product, exceeded my expectations;Grove Square hot chocolate is very tasty.  I was searching for The Swiss Miss brand and the search pulled up this one.
2971;too expensive;These poptarts are delicious, but these are way to expensive.  After purchasing these, my daughter found the exact same thing at Food 4 Less for $8.
2972;Jamaica me crazy coffee;Very Good.  This is our favorite K-cup by far.
2973;Very Tasty & Nutritious Pasta;I buy this pasta by the case now since it is so convenient at Amazon.  Better than waiting for sales at my local supermarket.
2974;Where has this been all my life!;I have no negative comments about this product. It far exceeded my expectations and there is no better price either at any other site.
2975;Oh wow!;I've gone to bloody mary heaven. No more mediocre drinks.
2976;Good, but not crunchy enough;"These almonds are good, but I prefer my almonds crunchy and pack after pack of these had ""soft/stale"" almonds.  I prefer the sea salt oven roasted ones much better--they are excellent <a href=""http://www."
2977;Too much salt;I can smell the sesame but the sesame taste is not strong enough. There is too much salt which covered the natural taste of seaweed.
2978;Short lived;Lamb chews seem a bit more oily than other types of chews and they wouldn't last long with an aggressive chewer. My dog liked them but they don't last long.
2979;Interesting Noodle Replacement;Bought these as a no carb alternative to noodles.  They are a great replacement when you are really craving noodles.
2980;"6"" odor free bully sticks";My dogs love them ! Just know they come in different thickness also . I bought small/med not knowing and they went quick .
2981;Coffee....coffee, coffee, coffee;Great tasting coffee.  Hard to find Decaf Chocolate Flavored whole beans and this is the 2nd order of what I am sure will be a continuing purchase.
2982;Ribena Fans!;Our family loves Ribena, a British favorite.  Ribena is a delicious black currant concentrate.
2983;Did not know they had changed the formula;The new formula is horrible.  Gave me bad, BAD stomach issues the entire day after taking it.
2984;I Want To Swim In It... But Only Metaphorically;I've taken to leaving soda out of my normal diet. I am in no way a health-food guy, but by simply cutting out soda I find that I am<br />actually shaving hundreds of calories a day.
2985;Yummy Ginger Cookies;Mi-Del Ginger Snaps are far better in texture and flavor than any I have ever purchased. I have eaten many varieties of ginger snaps in my 85 years of life, and appreciate this as an exceptionally good product.
2986;Ultra Pearls--the easiness of this litter!;I consider this litter easy because it lasts about 2 weeks for two of my cats. I only have to rake it during those two weeks, then I clean the entire box with detergent, get out the new bag of litter, and I'm done!  The other important part of this litter is that I can flush the poop in the toliet.
2987;Magical Ganoderma!!;I had a baby 4 months ago and always tired sleepy and cranky!! Been drinking this tea for one week and my back pain and headache is gone!!! I have more energy and never tired anymore. When I was younger I've always heard of ganoderma but never had a chance to try it.
2988;Lipton chai tea;Excellent chai tea at an excellent price.  I have not seen this at any of my neighborhood supermarkets, glad I can buy it on Amazon.
2989;Great product;I have always liked snickers,<br />and to have it in a dark chocolate is a big plus..
2990;GOOD SALMON;Simply good salmon, I use the 2 ounce package to add to my spicy noodles with one slice of cheese and I crunch up some seaweed into the bowl with the rest of the mixture, and I tell you, it is delicious and it satisfies me all day, you've got to try it.  I'm about to order some more now.
2991;Best Chocolate EVER!!!;I frist tried this chocolate as a gift, finished the 1kg (2 lb) in 2 days. Went back to the person and asked for more.
2992;yummy;My son's favorite flavor by far.  These are a great snack for walks, waiting for dinner, and out at a restaurant.
2993;The Best Italian Seasoning;This seasoning blend used to be carried in our local store, and then suddenly we couldn't find it ANYWHERE.  I'm so happy to be able to order it!  It's so much more than your regular, grocery-store mix of oregano, parsley, and other greenery.
2994;Nice to get a Gerber variety pack;I appreciated this product b/c it was one of the only variety packs of Gerber baby foods available.  It wasn't tons of choice (apple banana strawberry, applesauce, banana), but most of the time you can get 18 count of a variety pack from Gerber.
2995;Love this syrup;I subscribe to this product and always end up needing a shipment before the schedule I set. I use it to make iced mocha's which I drink all year long.
2996;Lori In Loveland;"These are the closest thing to the old Campfire marshmallows from the 50s that came in a wax paper lined divided box. They were incredible! These are the next best thing!! The taste is wonderful and they aren't just squishy air! The jet puffed marshmallows just don't compare to these! Two drawbacks: I'm addicted and they aren't cheap!<a href=""http://www."
2997;A Tropical Dream;This matcha kind of snuck up on me. At first, I wasn't sure if it was very coconut-y, and I was just sipping away.
2998;The best tea;It's the same great tea you can buy in tin cans, but in bulk package. I buy these bags to refill the tin cans.
2999;Great Decaf K-Cup;We have a Keurig coffee brewer and are always on the look out for strong but not bitter coffee.  The Emeril Jazzed Up Decaf fits the bill.
3000;A lovely Oolong without the tea shop price.;I enjoy loose leaf teas..
3001;"""Tres intense"" K-cup blend stronger than the usual fare";Dark Magic is for coffee drinkers searching for something bolder than the breakfast blends and flavored coffees ubiquitous on supermarket shelves. Whether it will satisfy depends on what you normally buy at coffee shops.
3002;"Not authentic, should be called ""Green Tea Blend""";I have tried numerous teas from Celestial Seasonings and by and large I've enjoyed them all.  Not this one.
3003;Chia Seeds as a Health Supplement;I've purchased Chia Seeds twice on Amazon and I am completely satisfied with the product, as well as the quick shipment. The benefits of Chia Seeds are very positive.
3004;My cats will only eat blue salmon;I feed all my animals (2 dogs& 2 cats) blue buffalo and they absolutely love it. My cats are so picky though they will only eat the salmon flavor, when I bring it home they surround the bag and start rubbing it.
3005;The only sushi wrap I use and trust!;With the seaweed sushi nori, you have to be careful with, especially the ones from China.  A lot of them have added chemicals, or are manufactured in questionable ways.
3006;Only tried one flavor so far, but it is amazing.;I just happened to see this item at the store when I was looking for Chunky soup, and decided to try it.  IT IS AWESOME!  It bursts with flavor and texture.
3007;Good Dog Food;I am very pleased with this dog food. My sheltie has a good coat and good movements with Harmony Farms.
3008;Amazing Dog Food for Amazing Dogs!;I have been searching for the best food to feed my two small dogs:  One is a rescue Maltese/Havanese mix, 7 pounds, one and a half years old
3009;Great stuff Great Service;This is the best Maple Syrup ever..
3010;DELICIOUS, but HARD to FIND;This price is no deal!<br /><br />These Brownies are absolutely delicious..
3011;Yuck!;The first roll of bags was fine, but so far every bag on the second roll has been defective ..
3012;might makes a nice furniture polish;I tried this product because it has a lot of things I like and routinely use in it: shea, argan, almond oil, and I am always looking for natural, plant-based products.  It might well make your hair shiny, because it doesn't come out (I have washed my hair twice now.
3013;Delicious, delicious, delicious!;The apple flavor is great for those who like the taste of Martinelli's Sparkling Apple Cider. What's great about IZZE is their lack of added sugar.
3014;Delish;I love this coffee. I like a strong coffee and this is just right for me.
3015;Baby Loved It!;My daughter loved this because it was chunkier than the Earth's Best stage 3 foods.  The only thing is that while Earth's Best is cheaper through Amazon Mom, this is actually cheaper through Fresh Direct, so we get our through them.
3016;great syrup - huge opening so pour slowly!;This syrup is very delicious - my husband loves it.  It is a thinner syrup and the opening is very large so you have to be very careful when pouring it.
3017;Turkey flavor;Cats are liking this flavor. Cans arrived dented so 4 stars instead of 5.
3018;jttodd;"Makes a great cup of sugar free-fat free 25 calorie hot cocoa!  It's not quite as ""rich"" a product as some of  the gourmet cocoas, but for those of us on restricted diets, it's a really good product. I like the canister because it's convenient and pretty much spill proof."
3019;The taste doesn't do it for me....;I still think that Vine food reviews should include more than one small sample, because you only get a gutcheck reaction and not all products are viable to that method.  This one is not, I did a lot of juicing the month of January and used real ginger root.
3020;Five star skin disorders!;I love this pasta, sumptuous and filling, the whole family barks with joy when I prepare it.  Despite the debiliating rash that it gives me when I eat it, I nonetheless give it a five star rating.
3021;Food as medicine;We ordered this on our Doctor's recommendation and take a tablespoon every day as a supplement. It's supposed to have several omega acids.
3022;Wonderful!;This is by far one of the best things I have bought since my baby was born.  It is kind of like my pump, in that it was an initial investment that has paid for itself.
3023;Okay pasta;I know we are in the minority on this one!  We have not tried a large variety of gluten free pasta brands so I do not have a huge reference point.  Our first pasta brand was Sam's Mills corn pasta and it is still our favorite.
3024;Who are these gevalians and why are their cups so small?;Pros: When Gevalia says Dark Chocolate, they mean it<br />Cons: Since when did 6oz become a cup?<br /><br />I have always preferred South American coffee to other regions.  A lot of commercial brands have been selling junk from the area but South America's better beans have a smooth taste with very little bitterness.
3025;Dark Magic - Green Mt. K Cups;This is a fantastic, full-flavored, coffee for those who like bold or dark coffees.  Initially I was reluctant, cause of the name,to buy it, thinking it might be flavored or something, but I was in for a surprise.
3026;Great for training.;My dog loves these and so do I : ).  No yucky texture or greasy feel such as with hot dog pieces or cheese pieces and no grossness in your pocket or treat bag.
3027;Blows other vegetable stocks away;The manufacturer describes this better than I can. I've been using their products for years with fantastic results.
3028;Great Product!;I have several friends and family members with food allergies (gluten, dairy) which effect their ability to eat delicious desserts.  When I found this syrup I jumped on the chance to get them some.
3029;Delicious and safe!;This is a fantastic find for our dairy- and soy-allergic child.  We make it with rice milk and it comes out just fine like regular pancakes, even though cooking other things with rice milk can sometimes be challenging.
3030;Makes Ande's Mints look like gourmet chocolate;These things are simply horrible.  They make Ande's Mints look like gourmet chocolate (and I love Ande's).
3031;The real thing!;I loaded up on these while in England recently and brought them back. When I run out, I will be refreshing my stock from Amazon! They are DEFINITELY the same as the 1970's Marathon bar.
3032;very good combination of seeds;for not having the flavors like the others, these are full of flavor. great purchase and will continue to order.
3033;REAL BREAD!!!;It has been 11 months since I began a gluten free diet and this is the first bread I've eaten which tastes good. It is moist and holds together well even when sliced warm out of the bread maker.
3034;Amazing Body or Massage Oil/Lotion and Lube!!!;This oil is so amazing!<br />1. It smells delicious.
3035;This stuff is fantastic!;I started using this product after a cycling buddy told me about it at the gym.  It helps great with muscle recovery after a hard workout.
3036;You have to be kidding;I see this is now 30 bucks for 2 bags, shipped.  What a joke.
3037;Good coffee, good price;I switched to decaf coffee since I'm expecting. The problem I found though is that the selections at my local stores leaves something to be desired if you're a flavored coffee drinker like myself.
3038;Puppy has diarrhea after eating HS canned puppy food;I had a German Shepherd puppy who had frequent diarrhea. Giardia and fecal tests at the Vet's always come up negative.
3039;Below expectations;This is not the best manuka honey you can buy. My jar arrived with a flimsy lid (I should have returned it right then, but I wanted to give it a try).
3040;Bamboo Shocker!!!;"I was shocked! I was looking for a basic bamboo tea box, and I ran across this box from one of my personal favorites, ""Two Leaves and a Bud"", so I gave it a shot. Upon delivery, I was pleasantly surprised to notice the build quality & the size of this box."
3041;Good!;This Chai Tea is just the right amount of sweetness and great evening drink. I love my keurig and the chai tea is one of my top choices for a hot drink.
3042;How Coconut Water Should Taste;This is exactly how coconut water SHOULD taste, and how ZICO USED TO TASTE before they ruined their product by adding sweeteners/modifying the formula.  The only coconut water that comes close to this one is the ZICO in the tetra pak, which I believe are no longer being produced.
3043;Someting apart from the description!;"Product Description says:<br /> ""It can be substituted for domestic long grained rices for an aromatic touch and special flavor"
3044;Love this flavor!;This is my favorite flavor of coffee for my Keurig.  I like coffee that is a lighter brew, and this is perfect.
3045;Kettle potato chips:  Fully loaded baked potato;I have never met a Kettle brand chip I did not like. These chips have a great loaded potato flavor, which are flavorful.
3046;Ferret travel aide;Very handy to take along for short visits, it won't spill, and you can even add the Bi-odor..
3047;Great!;Incredible savings. Great carbonation.
3048;Just what I (and my dogs) needed;"My two border collies can eat through 10-inch ""rawhide rolls"" in one evening (that's one bone per dog). That gets expensive! These 24-inch bones with knotted ends are a better deal."
3049;Very affordable and shipping is quick.;I have used pill pockets in the past, and continue to use them. It makes it so easy to administer especially if you have a hard time giving medication to your pet.
3050;Yummy!;I love this soup! I keep it in my trunk, in my desk at work, and in my cabinet at home. Anytime I don't feel like cooking I just pop one in the microwave.
3051;takes to long to get;Wonderful coffee but takes to long to get to my home. When I ordered it, they said it was in stock and ready to ship.
3052;there is no better waffle mix;I purchased goldens malted waffle mix appox. 6 months ago after trying the waffles in a hotel while traveling,it was great.
3053;easy but pricy;I decorate cakes and this is a great icing if you don't like making it from scratch. It is expensive and it is a little heavy but it is reliable.
3054;not good;My friend and I all bought this products. It tastes not very good.
3055;NO Disappointments Here;I wanted a powdered green drink mix made from a variety of grasses to get the unique benefits of each.  This one fit the bill, tastes great, & mixes easily with water or juice.
3056;Very Rich;I like a deep, rich, robust cup of coffee.  This one fit the bill.
3057;salty salty salty;The first pan was pretty oily, in fact I think the oil weighed more than the kernels. In the second pan I used only half the oil that came with it, it popped the same as the first pan and would have tasted good except for the extreme amount of salt.
3058;This cereal isn't sweet;I never smoked,and have all my taste buds intact. This cereal is less sweet then corn flakes or wheaties by a long shot.
3059;My cats love this Venison & Fish Ziwipeak;I've researched the ingredients and I think this is a high quality, clean product. But it's better for the cats if you add water to it, as even a vet on their website mentions.
3060;The best meat snack;I ran into these at a convenience store when I lived in Delaware, and thought they were the best meat snack I had ever had. Unfortunately, the store only ever got one case of them.
3061;The Best from Argentina!;These are just the best alfajores around. I've tried many brands, but Havanna alfajores are the ultimate in terms of taste and quality.
3062;Tasty beverage!;Sprite is my favorite soft drink. It is very refreshing and goes well with just about any kind of food.
3063;Best with unsalted butter;This is easy, tastes great, and anyone else will think you did a lot of prep. And I cook a lot of Indian from scratch.
3064;Great soup noodles!;I've been experimenting with various homemade soup and chili recipes in my crockpot this fall and winter, and was looking for a hearty noodle for chicken noodle soup.  I thought I'd give these a try, and WOW.
3065;Not bad for kid food...;Product arrived quickly and was just about as quickly consumed by my kids.<br />Although they will eat it cold I think it tastes better warmed up.
3066;Don't know about the cakes, but the customer service sucks;I ordered a cake-of-the-month for my dad and stepmom on the opposite coast on December 15. As of January 5, they still did not receive the card noticing them of the gift.
3067;Nestle's Fat Free for Me;I start each day with a cup of hot chocolate.  I worried that this product was discontinued because I couldn't find it for some time.
3068;Protein-packed, vegan BUT fairly high sodium context;After the rise in price, I've become dissatisfied with this cereal. Very high sodium content.
3069;Epic waste of my time and money!;I have two trees that I am trying to keep the squirrels out of. After heavy treatment with this spray, it did not even phase them.
3070;Magical;A slightly aggressive approach gives way to a fullness that is unmatched by the other so-called extra bold varieties. The finish is crisp, clean, and ultimately satisfying.
3071;totally addictive;I've never tasted a better hard candy. I love the combination of sweet and hot flavors.
3072;Vegan Natural Kosher Gluten-Free Choice;Vegan. Natural.
3073;Absolutely Perfect - Just don't heat at too high a temperature;I bought Fireworks Wisconsin white birch popcorn 64oz seeking the perfect popcorn for my Whirleypop popper, but I wrecked the batches simply by cooking them too hot. Now I've discovered on my own how to do it RIGHT.
3074;It IS the best;Short of spending $100 a pound, this is the best tea I've ever found.  Great on its own, and can stand up to milk or cream.
3075;Very pleased;The package arrive earlier than expected. The candy was well-packed, no broken sticks, and they all seem fresh.
3076;My review;Of the Sodastream syrups, this is my favorite.  Unlike the other flavors, which are very often poor remakes of classic brands, the orange flavor is unique.
3077;Excellent value;The chips are delicious, the price was much better than the grocery store, and the order arrived within two days. It's a great way to shop.
3078;not for everyone...;definitely does NOT taste like berries. it tastes like seaweed, which i used to snack on so i'm okay with it.
3079;Healthy Orange rawhide treat;I brought from this company many, many times, love the items, love the service, price all are great! I like giving my dog natural and healthy treats,she loves all of them and the donuts last a very long time, she eats the fruit inside first but it still has the flavor in the rawhide part which she will chew on forever. I do wish they made the spirulina flavor in a donut shape ( I don't like the knotted bones, ends fall off), But all in all, I will continue to buy from this company.
3080;just like a good candy bar;Love, love choc,cherry cashew Kind bar. I will eat this in place of my regular candy treats.
3081;This is a big rip off;I ordered this product thinking it would be something worth 10 USD.  It failed, unfortunately upon receipt over half of the product was nothing more than broken hearts.
3082;Great tasting coffee;I have a Cuisinart single serve coffee maker and after much experimentation I've found the perfect ratio:  2 pods per 12oz cup.  I have the Senseo Sumatra Blend delivered monthly via Amazon subscription service, and I am completely happy with this coffee.
3083;Fantastic;"Closest ""red"" Mexican rice since a dinner in Mexico.  I add two heaping tbsps."
3084;Yummy;I've been drinking these for a while now and all I can say is yummy! If your looking for a low calorie alternative to cokes this is it. A 12 oz bottle has only 130 calories.
3085;Not bad;I liked this shampoo quite a bit, although please note this review is only after one use. I am not able to agree with the build left behind after once use, but did not experience that so far.
3086;Received order completly thawed;Though the steaks look nice I received them completely thawed. Other online meat companies ship totally frozen so it was a shock to receive thawed meat.
3087;smiles;Smiles..
3088;I actually tasted the product;I just discovered these tomatoes on Amazon.<br /><br />Unlike the previous reviewer, I have actually tasted these tomatoes .
3089;Sweet and crunchy.;Lives up to it's name.  It tastes sweeter than 120 calories and 1 gram of fat (zero saturated fat).
3090;best ever;This bbq sauce is my favorite!! It's very different from traditional BBQ sauce. It's sweet and tangy, but not spicy like some BBQ sauce can be.
3091;Great little cookies;"These cookies taste like Nabisco's Ginger snaps, only with oatmeal and cinnamon.  They have a ""snap"" consistency to them, meaning they do bend when you bite them, but then *snap* off, so they are both chewy and crispy at the same time."
3092;Neither Healthy Nor Delicious;I don't understand all the 5 star reviews here. I am a very health conscious eater, and I usually like meat alternatives.
3093;The BEST!!!!;Tried the almonds today for the first time.  I'm ordering a case right now.
3094;Like them separate, not together;I purposely get aloe vera products for first aid and for cosmetics (lotion especially). I drink at least two mugs of green tea a day.
3095;Don't care for taste;I heard Maldon was supposed to have a wonderful taste. After using it for a while, my husband and I don't care for the tast so much.
3096;Awful;Good price but the coffee is horrible.  It tastes both sour and bitter.
3097;Woodhouse Chocolates Are the Best In the Nation;When I lived about 45 minutes southeast of St. Helena, I would be sure to drive there to Woodhouse Chocolates, at least once per month, and indulge in the best, hand-made chocolates, made on site, that I have ever had.
3098;Mmmm...;Mmmm!  It is unhealthy and very tasty!  I recommend to eat all 5+ lb of candy all at once! om nom nom nom..
3099;Not tastey;I fed this product to my cat and my roommate's cat.  I was experimenting with food since the cats are almost 1, and I wanted to introduce different kinds of adult food so they'd get used to them.
3100;Disappointing;I love Earl Grey. I love Zhena's Earl Green.
3101;Cure for Cottonmouth;This product is absolutely delicious. I purchased a case and received it in 2 days thanks to amazon prime.
3102;Great!;The product was great and arrived on time but if you order this product think it through. I ordered them in late may and the arrived in early June.
3103;Great Living Plant for Small Environment;Brussel's DT0117ALW Hawaiian Umbrella Tree in Water Pot Bonsai:  I received it as a gift from my daughter.  It was easy to set up.
3104;Brew it cold!;Okay, here's the deal.  I make salad dressing from scratch.
3105;Wow!  Better than movie popcorn at home!;We ordered Great Northern Popcorn, 8 oz packs from Discount Tommy to use in our school's concession stand.  Talk about amazing popcorn!  Each and every batch tastes exactly the same and our customers LOVE it!  At every event, we have people talking about how our popcorn tastes better than anywhere else.
3106;REALLY GOOD!;My teenage daughter and all of her friends keep eating these. They are really tasty and the chili lime is my personal favorite.
3107;Barren Creek Beef Jerky;Package came with the Sweet BBQ jerky and also a free sample of Barren Creek's top shelf jerky.  That's a customer service + for me.
3108;shockingly good;Can you believe a no-sugar, no-fat product that still has enough flavor to be satisfying?  Truly I was shocked..
3109;High quality, flavorful tea.;Two Leaves and a Bud Organic Earl Grey tea is simply delicious.  Each box comes with one hundred mesh bags of whole tea, not the dust and debris you'll find in cheaper brands.
3110;My son loves this Mac & Cheese;My son is now 14 months old. The first 2 times I tried to feed him the Butternut Squash and Mac & Cheese he wouldn't have anything to do with it.
3111;Just a great product;I'm diabetic and have tried many sugar substitutes and I like stevia the best, plus it puts some fiber in your diet.  Before trying Stevia I had mostly used sucralose (Splenda) and drinks and foods sweetened with sucralose but found them to be overly sweet for my taste.
3112;This is not gourmet coffee, but...;This is not gourmet coffee.  No single cup coffee maker is.
3113;My dog loves these!;"My little Doxie just loves these, and I have to say that they really do seem to help control ""doggie breath"". So it's a win-win."
3114;Tasty;I ordered the hot mix by mistake because I didn't read carefully enough. It didn't matter this mix is great and not burn your face off hot, which I hate.
3115;Most tasty protein bar I have ever had;This is the most tasty protein bar I have ever had. I introduced to people at work and some of them just get hooked.
3116;Sweet DEAL!;These are great to have!  I toss one in my daughter's lunch..
3117;Wakes me Up Without Making Me Jittery and Tastes Good Too;Stash Green Chai tea is very tasty, especially when it's mixed with some milk and honey.  Even better, it has the perfect amount of caffeine for me--just enough to wake me up without making me sweaty and jittery like coffee does.
3118;Convenience at low cost;I subscribed to these - one case every three months. That comes out to about $5 a month for the convenience of having my favorite chips handy whenever I want.
3119;Very fresh and tasty;I bought Big Hunks when I came across them in retail stores, which wasn't very often.  When I did find them, they were usually kind of stale from sitting there for a while.
3120;I love that bread, but it arrived moist;I bought some Maetemacher Bread before without problem. This one is very good, but the bread is a bit moist, and the edges crumble.
3121;Kitty Crack;My cats have become addicted to this stuff and will not eat any other treats now that they have tried these. They are also very finicky eaters.
3122;Join the Chub Club;"You know how in movies and on TV, when a person is murdered and thrown into the river, they come out all bloated and water logged? The Jack Link's Lil Chub"" is essentially a Slim Jim that was murdered and thrown into the river. Wouldn't you know it after a few hours it came out bloated, soft, and a little rounder than it should be."
3123;THE BEST EVER;These are the best gummie bears I have evvvveeerr had. We sell them where I work so I had to get my hands on some.
3124;Raw Sugar;Good tasting but has a texture more like Brown Sugar than Raw Sugar.Still a good product.
3125;We love this cereal for our baby;We love this cereal and the fact that it has probiotics.  I am not a big fan of the DHA from external sources such as algae, because it is not the same as the DHA found in breast milk.
3126;Starbucks VIA Italian Roast;I like the Italian roast but love the Colombian roast, for it's satisfying flavor.<br />Please stock the Hazelnut Blend ,if available.
3127;The Best for the money;I have been using this product, as well as the duck breast, for well over a year. There is no comparison to Tail Waggers from [.
3128;Idahoan Hashbrown Potatoes;If you want a fast way to provide superb tasting potatoes to your guests or yourself Idahoan products are definitely the way to go. Great taste and you would never know they came out a package they taste that good.
3129;Fantastic for Pear Nut Bread;I find these pears to be a high quality dried fruit. I love to substitute them for dried appricots in making nut breads.
3130;Can You Say Itch Free, Fluffy Puppy Part II?;"Please see ""Can You Say Itch Free, Fluffy Puppy"" review at BIO-GROOM Natural Oatmeal Soothing Dog Shampoo (32 oz.)  for Part I."
3131;fast acting wake up call;Great product , I've been an avid fun of hydroxycut hardcore from muscle tech for many years now. I have been also exposed to ephedrine for quite some time.
3132;Perhaps the World's Best Chocolate;"All Rapunzel Dark Chocolates are sweetened with their ""Rapadura"" Whole Unrefined Cane Sugar, unlike virtually all organic chocolate brands which use refined ""Raw Sugar""  This full flavored and carmel-like sugar is the reduced whole syrup of the cane juice with its full content of mineral-rich molasses. Whole sugar imparts a deeper flavor to the chocolate that may take a little getting used to, but when done its superiority becomes absolutely apparent."
3133;my dogs lost interest quickly.;my dogs lost interest in chewing in a short period of time.  now they just lay around on the floor untouched.
3134;Our dog loves Greenies;"Our old dog has dental problems and arthritis.  She LOVES her Greenies and reminds us that she ""deserves"" one a day."
3135;Better than Mountain Dew;I had been wanting to try Water Joe Forever and once Amazon got it.  I jumped on it and finally tried it and I really liked it.
3136;Oil is good, bottle is not;I like the oil a lot. And do everything with it.
3137;Wow. These are BAD!;I can't believe I am the only person to find these crackers inedible! They are like compressed cakes of cardboard in both texture and they taste like..
3138;Great Stuff!;I have been having problems with my bladder. Interstital Cystitis is a chronic condition and also effects the colon.
3139;BEWARE!!!;"I air-pop my corn at home, sprinkle salt and eat them in a ""healthy"" way without butter.<br /><br />When I sprinkle this on ""dry"" freshly popped corn, the powder is so fine that the powder either goes into my nose (when I breath out while eating, which we usually do as humans, try holding your breath while chewing something it's not natural) making me cringe, or into my throat (air vent) making me cough/choke."
3140;Great Product, Hands Down!;As a sports referee for Basketball and Lacrosse, I do a lot of running, stopping, changing directions in an instance. This takes a toll on bones, muscles and joints.
3141;Delicious, but not filling;I thought the Quaker Banana Nut Bread cereal bar was delicious--it tasted just like banana bread! It was incredibly soft and had a variety of ingredients (not just cake and bananas). It certainly tasted as good as some of the less healthy options, but it was only 140 calories! Unfortunately, it didn't really satisfy my hunger so the calories weren't worth it.
3142;Very handy for travel;These are great for the diaper bag and air travel.  There is a limit to how much ready made formula you can bring through security these solved that problem (mix after security check).
3143;Great Deal;Ordered on Sunday and arrived on Monday. WOW.
3144;Oh, so very very very VERY good;I LOVE these cookies.  Most cookies are too sweet for me -- not these.
3145;Not that impressed and neither were my dogs;We live in a rural/suburban town where there are large open spaces.  We have over a mile of open space behind our home that includes many trees and a creek and is a perfect habitat for coyotes, skunks, rabbits, snakes, etc.
3146;The best so far.;This coffee is the best K cup we have tried.  It is big and bold and we love it.
3147;why Only 4 Stars?;This was pretty cut and dry as far as installing this device however the reason I gave only 4 stars was because the write up says it comes with a mounting stake and it DID NOT.  Other than that good product for an excellent price.
3148;Great Stuff;I love this stuff.  I use it in a pilaf, or soup and I've even tossed it in Beef tacos to cut down the fat and boost the nutritional value.
3149;chompchompchomp;great product, great price, great service
3150;Worst protein bar ever tasted!;Other reviewers here that gave this bar a good review must have been paid off by thinkthin.  Theses are the worst tasting protein bars I've ever tasted in my life.
3151;Not hassle free!;Buyer beware.  Read  COMPLETELY  when and what you are getting and how much it is.
3152;Chloe loves them!;Our Boston Terrier loves these bones - we give them to her as a treat or to keep her busy when we have company.  For a 16 lbs.
3153;crunchy giraffes;All of the Snackimals varieties are a treat -- crunchy, satisfying, and fun to eat.  I like the Wheat-Free variety best, but vanilla is a close second.
3154;Hard to Understand;The instructions on this package were atrocious.  They didn't make sense, and I couldn't figure out how much water to use.
3155;YUMMY TREAT THAT CAN`T BE BEAT !!!;THIS THE YUMMIEST OF ALL OF THE BROWN RICE MARSHMALLOW TREATS THAT GLENNY`S OFFERS. ALL OF THE FAMILY MEMBERS I GAVE IT TO ABSOLUTELY LOVED IT.
3156;Yuck!;I have had Honeybush tea bought in South Africa. This stuff is horrid with no flavor.
3157;J. Wilbur Hickory Smoke BBQ Sauce;"I use BBQ Sauce very sparingly, that said, the little that I apply to my finished BBQ product as a final ""glaze"" must be outstanding.  In my opinion, this sauce has a great consistency, not too watery where it sticks quite nicely to the meat."
3158;Very good coffee;This coffee is very good.  Wonderful aroma, mild but full flavor.
3159;Not your typical store-bought;As other reviewers have said, this flavor tends to be slightly more crumbly than other Nana's No Gluten varieties, but certainly not enough so to phase me.  It is also exactly as spicy as most of us know and love about any ginger baked good.
3160;love vita coco but don't like this flavor at all;Love vita coco. Always prefer it to zico.
3161;$18 for a six pack of Snapple, REALLY??;That's right I thought that price was for a Case, not six.<br />This is beyond Greed, it's Insane.
3162;Bad Batch?;We have bought these from a variety of sources over the past 2 years.  This bag came and the chicken meatballs seemed to be an odd texture with pink centers and a lot harder than any of the others - we ended up tossing most of the bag.
3163;San Francisco Bay Coffee One Cup for Keurig  K-cup Brewers, French Roast, 36 count;I received this order already on time. I was late in writing my review.
3164;Good taste and only 5 calories;Tried this tea because it was in an isle (not on a shelf) in the grocery store.<br />After trying the tea was sold on the taste and being only 5 calories I was again sold.
3165;Best Mints!;These mintsnhave a perfect mx of not too strong, but not too weak. I always keep them with me and they are great for freshening  your breath.
3166;My mother loved them;Said they were among the best chocolates she's ever had.<br />So that is good enough for me.
3167;Love this rice;This is the best stuff for working people.  The rice is good for you, plentiful, fast and easy to make (microwave).
3168;For Your Child or Your Dog!;"We originally bought this for Sadie, our 75-pound golden retreiver.  For a few months, she showed some interest in the cute, small, squeaking toy, gingerly taking it in her mouth like as it were her her little puppy (insert collective ""awwwww"" here)."
3169;Three cats said Neooooooow;I sure liked the ingredients, the description and even the smell of these treats. But my three cats weren't even intrigued enough to taste them, so regretfully they have given these treats one star.
3170;Yummy!;"Natural passion fruit and yummy aloe vera taste.  There is no ""tea"" taste but it tastes more like a juice drink."
3171;Love it;I wasn't sure what this salmon would be like.  I saw it recommended on a site listing portable paleo-friendly food, so I gave it a try.
3172;The very best oatmeal!;I am not a fan of oatmeal. At least not the cooked variety of processed oats.
3173;Outstanding Dark Brown Sugar;This is the way dark brown sugar is supposed to taste.  Many, Many years ago the stores used to carry dark brown sugar like this.
3174;Ludicrous Price for Amazon;The price for these k-cups on Amazon is ludicrous.  They are actually cheaper in a department store paying sales tax.
3175;No Caffeine Boost;"Brewed my first cup this morning and was not impressed.  You can taste the blueberry, wine and chocolate characteristics, but this light roast coffee does not offer a ""first cup in the morning"" big caffeine boost."
3176;Love garlic crisps;My family really enjoys this product.  Flavor means fewer crisps satisfy, so my order lasted longer than some snack purchases.
3177;Very good organic Sunbutter;Per the manufacturer, the product is organic and only made from Sunflower seeds.  It tastes very natural and fresh.
3178;terribly sour;This flavor was just awful. my daughter refuses to eat it as it's so sour and tastes just plain gross.
3179;??????;"""ordered 2 products from this co. they stated they had one product and the other was out of stock i asked for the refund for the product that was out of stock because they stated that they did not know when they would get it in so i asked for a refund they have yet to give me i have been emailing them for days now almost a week with no response as to what they are going to do worst ever."
3180;Delicious and great price;These almonds are very tasty.  I eat them alone and sometimes mix them with plain Greek yogurt for a delicious and healthy treat.
3181;Strange Dog Treat;This is the strangest thing I've ever seen.  Imagine your roll on deodorant container  being filled with some bacon flavored  gravy and then allowing your dog to lick from it for his daily treat!  Are you kidding me?  This idea is gross and unsanitary and how do you get a dog to understand the concept that they are only supposed to take a few licks and that's their treat.
3182;Very Good;I didn't know what to expect when I purchased these Energy Gel packs.  I intended to use one while walking a golf course for 4-5 hours for an added spurt of energy.
3183;Convenient, but lacking in taste;I give it 3 stars for the convenience of having everything proportioned in a single packet, but I didn't care for the flavor of this popcorn.  It did not have a buttery taste and was overly salty.
3184;Rating the tomatoes. Not the price!;I buy these by the case when meijers has them in their 10 for $10 sale. Usually a couple of cases.
3185;McCann's Irish Oatmeal in instant packets;McCANN'S Instant Irish Oatmeal, Maple & Brown Sugar, 10-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)<br /><br />This is, by far, the best-tasting instant oatmeal available with a firmer texture (not as mushy) than others. The flavors are clean and not too sweet.
3186;Truly concentrated juice;This juice is actually concentrated as advertised. Of all the juice concentrates of any flavor i have tried, this one is the most concentrated, and i expected the others to be as concentrated but they were all thin.
3187;awesome pretzels!;Although it is my daughter that has Celiac Disease, I try everything she eats.  These pretzels taste great, if not better than 'regular' ones.
3188;Finally a no calorie sweetner I can use!!!;I don't know what it is but I have never been able to handle no calorie sweeteners. I've tried them all.
3189;DO NOT waste your money;If something sounds too good to be true, it is. These Miracle Noodles (should be called Nasty Noodles) are exactly that.
3190;What a PITA!;This bonsai came very well packed I must say. However, almost immediately the leaves turned yellow and all started to fall off.
3191;Happy Dogs!;Great product and shipping! Hopefully these aren't made in China as I will no longer buy this product if it is. There are plenty of US and local made products to choose from that are safe.
3192;Cheetos for you cat!;"I normally hand-feed treats like this to the Persian king in this house, however, since these are a bit smaller, he just eats them from my hand.  That said, they're NOT in my hand very long!  He just thinks these things are the ""bees knees"" and cannot get enough of them! He about ate the entire package the first time too."
3193;Dogs love Dingo's;I buy Dingo treats for several reasons. One, dogs love them, two they don't leave stains and three the price is reasonable.
3194;Good, and just enough to satisfy you.;My family is on the last box.  My oldest daughter ate most of the cookies.
3195;excellent and delicious;this rice is so good. it's better than I could ever cook, even in a rice maker.
3196;It was very weak and barely drinkable in my opinion;This was my first time with Lavazza. The coffee was weak, light, flavor was OK but not what I was expecting from an Italian coffee.
3197;Not a huge fan;These are all right.  I probably liked chips ahoy! cookies more as a child than I do now.
3198;Endless possibilities;I used these bouncy balls for a senior prank at my school. I had the balls suspended in a bucket above the celling and with a pull of a string the bouncy balls fell down and through a ridged celling tile onto the tile flooring.
3199;Yummy and 'healthy';I love peanut butter so..
3200;ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS;As a former chef-owner of a restaurant in my younger years, I was  surprised and delighted at the exceptionally good taste and texture of the Bookbinder's White Clam sauce wihtout doctoring.  It is a great product for easy convenience.
3201;nestle, hot cocoa;I was very happy with this product.  You couldn't be the price.
3202;Good for what it is;I love tea and wanted to give loose leaf a try. However, loose leaf tea can be pretty expensive and I'm picky with tea.
3203;WOW is right!;sublime. a more perfect oatmeal cookie, i cannot imagine.
3204;Love it;I'm a chamomile tea fan--I drink it every night--and these tea K-cups are super delicious and convenient. I re-use the same K-cup for several tea cups' worth, though the resulting tea gets significantly weaker with each re-use.
3205;Problems with labeling;Health Valley cream of mushroom soup is listed as gluten-free on Amazon, but I contacted the source ([..
3206;A Delicious Snack;These bars were so good.  There were big pieces of macadamia nut in them and the mango taste was intense.
3207;I like it;"Yeah, I agree it is kind of powdery but there is still more lemon ""grass"" than powder.  I have a feeling that you're just going to get powder as the strands of grass break and get moved around in the bag."
3208;Consider something else;I recently bought the Nespresso Totem for my Nespresso capsules.  I did not buy it through Amazon, but was compelled to leave a review.
3209;Tooo much packaging;Good tea, but huge waste of paper.  The amount of tea in each individual sachet is small and the paper envelope is large.
3210;Found them!;My husband has been looking for this product in the store and it is nowhere to be found. He is a happy camper.
3211;great mustards;I must admit i've long been a fan of Sierra Nevada's beers and their mustards are every bit as good.  I've enjoyed many mustards through the years but these are hands down the best.
3212;Best Store-Bought Cookie Available;If you've had these cookies already - no one needs to sell them to you. I would just recommend that you keep them in the freezer.
3213;Great coffee;I love the Senseo coffee pods. cheaper than the Bosch pods we have at work and better taste too.
3214;Anxious kitty - major improvement;I adopted a third cat a few months ago.  I had 2 females so decided a male would be the best addition and I had fallen in love with Bam Bam at the adoption center.
3215;Tasteless;I can tell you from experience that it is not hard to make healthy, low calorie, low sodium soup that tastes good.<br /><br />Calories for this soup are OK, and it has a few carrot pieces in it for a little extra nutrition.
3216;soggy and stale!;This is the first and last time I will be ordering food from Amazon. My 4 year old is addicted to Mini Nilla Wafers.
3217;Simply Organic Minced Onions;I really love the fact that I can get organic minced onions that are tasty.  I would definitely recommend this product.
3218;baseball chocolates;They came, they were in a pinata, they were eaten.  Kids loved them.
3219;great popcorn;My children love this popcorn. Very flavorful.
3220;Great little snack for hubby and me;My husband and I enjoy a crunchy snack every now and then, and want it to be not only good tasting, but nutritious as well. I ordered a box of each flavor Snackimals, and we have not been disappointed.
3221;Vegan food served in Buddhist monasteries;The food label Companion sells a line of vegan foods made of wheat gluten and tofu, many with vegetables like mushrooms, carrots, string beans, bamboo shoots, baby corns etc., seasoned with soy and/or chili sauce.
3222;bbq chips through amazon;Chips were fresh and securely packaged. It was not cost effective to pay retail and have to wait for delivery.
3223;Break out the Beano/Peanut Bar w/Protein Powder Aftertaste;On the plus side they do fill you up & are packed with protein, filling & gluten free. On the downside - unless your idea of tasty is protein powder, I'd choose a handful of nuts versus this bar.
3224;So Yummy!;I received this amazing Soft Baked Oatmeal Cookie in my Influenster Mom VoxBox. I'm normally not a fan of oatmeal raisin cookies since I don't like raisins, but this was delicious! The cookie was thick and tasted homemade with a nice oatmeal flavor.
3225;Other reviewers are correct: Creamy Tomato Parmesan is great soup!;Campbells Creamy Tomato Parmesan soup at hand is very tasty and convenient! I notice when I have a stuffy head, or especially a sore throat, that it is really soothing. I swear it made my throat better, and I really FELT better after I sipped it down.
3226;Great fun, once you've cooked your rice;This kit is GREAT - all you need to learn how to make sushi (although I did find some good clips on youtube on how to make the rolls) - the rice takes ages to make, you have to wash it three times, cook it, then let it cool (fan it perhaps), then add the rice vinegar or whatever you have to add to it - and it is TOTALLY yummy - and all the other items are great. We used shrimp, avocado, and cream cheese for our first rolls and they were restaurant quality taste due to the good ingredients (although the rolls themselves needed a little extra help to look perfect, but what can you expect, first time round) -  this is a really great kit.
3227;Very good quality just too expensive;I tried the EkoJava packets a while back when they were on sale for $10. The 4 star review is actually due to the cost of EkoJava more than anything else.
3228;Perfection...;This particular k-cup has become my favorite and I've had just about all of them from every k-cup maker.  I still enjoy many others, but this one is perfection.
3229;Uh-oh;Okay, the bottom line for this food is that my cat, Buster, wouldn't eat it.  He LOVES canned cat food usually, but is 13 1/2 years old and rather finicky now.
3230;Grade B maple syrup rocks!;Coombs Family Farms grade B maple syrup is our favorite maple syrup. It has a more intense maple flavor than grade A, in our opinion.
3231;Exquisite vegan chocolate;I first read about Lulu's in a tasting review on a website about non-dairy eating. I currently can't have dairy, soy, or nuts, so my chocolate options are very limited--and I am a chocoholic.
3232;Hard To Find;My wife's favorite tea, she lives on this stuff! Very difficult to find even though we live a stones throw from Baltimore. Wish we could find it in the old red and green box with not every bag individually wrapped.
3233;Planters;Planters products are the best.  These were the best cashews and I sent them as a gift.
3234;Puppy likes it!;I feed this to my puppy along with the dry formula to get her to eat more. She now is licking the bowl clean!<br /><br />She does seem to have large bowel movements with this, but it is getting her eating and I know I can trust the ingredients.
3235;YUM;I tried these in Colorado and came home to find out they only sell them on the west coast. Amazon didn't sell the ones I wanted.
3236;Toasted Tea;This is a tea for folks who love coffee.  The roasting of the leaves  brings out a chicory/coffee flavor without the acid or buzz of java.
3237;delicious fresh exotic flavor, unique and versatile;Bergamot is reminiscent of orange or lemon extract, but with it's own particular personality.  It is a delicious substitute for lemon flavoring in teas and cookies.
3238;Delicious;Just received this coffee and had to try a cup right away. It smells wonderful when it is brewing and tastes delicious, too.
3239;A Real Treat;My australian sheppard and italian greyhound love these flossies!  I put them in a large zip-loc bag and when I pick up the bag, they go nuts!  Of course, they have to sit and shake before getting one and they are very willing to do so.  I always keep this treat on hand.
3240;Delicious, Almost tastes Homemade;This bar tastes so good. I will definitely purchase.
3241;Not up to standard;I'm well into my sixth decade of life, and tuna has always been a favorite food.  By now I've found Chicken of the Sea to be my favorite brand with larger, lighter, firmer chunks.
3242;Tastes like Pure Alcohol;I feel bad writing a bad review, but I feel cheated and I don't believe other people should buy this product based on my experience with it. Maybe other products of theirs are good, but this one is exceptionally bad, especially since it is supposed to be gourmet.
3243;Baby Likes It;My infant son loves most of this food.  It is easy to get cases shipped and not fumble with individual jars in the store.
3244;Answering the Decaf Question;This coffee is very tasty. I too noticed the decaf text on the bag when it arrived.
3245;Senseo Coffee;I have been using Senseo Coffee for over 7 years and I love the fresh taste. I highly recommend buying Senseo Coffee pods.
3246;Delicious;David's are the best tasting sunflower seeds in the world.  The combination of the roasted taste and just the right amount of salt makes David's the best, hands down.
3247;One Word - FANTASTIC!;This is a great all around baking mix to have on hand.  We love the cookies, cakes, and pancakes you can make with this mix.
3248;pretty blue sugar;This was an addition to my sprinkles for Christmas cookies.  It was fun to use.
3249;These things are sooooo addictive;These things are great. I have tried most of the flavors and each one is great.
3250;Excellent Oats;We have been using the Quaker oats for over 10 years as a breakfast source, for making oatmeal raisin cookie, and for making granola. These are undoubtedly the best oats.
3251;NEVER MET A CARAMEL I DIDN'T LIKE;Yep, that's quite true - I've never met a carmel I didn't like (they have to be chewy, not hard).  Now, that I've admitted my bias I'll also say that Kraft caramels are my favorites.
3252;It Doesn't Grow!;I wouldn't buy this product again if it was 'free'..
3253;Amazingly light & Delicately sweet;The first time had these cookies was when I visited NYC.  One box of these cost me around $7, so when I found these on amazon.
3254;coffee  drinker  for  65 years  now.;"I loved  the coffee, I am so glad "" Folgers""  now have the k-cup  coffees.<br /> their great."
3255;FANTASTIC!;Organic green tea, with absolutely fantastic aroma is hard to find. This is a great example of a great tea.
3256;First but not last time to buy this one!!;I LOVED THIS COFFEE. I just got my order a few days ago and I normally drink just one cup of coffee in the morning.
3257;Good Flavor!;I started buying Lipton Noodles & Sauce years ago, and find it to be a very reliable, tasty product.  When Lipton first started making Noodles & Sauce, the product I purchased then was Tomato Basil Noodles (made with shells)
3258;9 lives flaked tuna in sauce;Worst cat food I have ever purchased. Cat refused to eat it.
3259;OMG!!!  Prevents stretch marks during pregnancy!  REALLY!;Okay..
3260;not too bad!;"If you like ""Prince"" Pasta this is a good substitute.."
3261;These are my pick!;These kippers have a wonderful flavor and texture.  They are smokey with just enough salt.
3262;Earth's Best Organic Infant Formula, Love it!!;Great formula, I think it's worth it to get organic formula, I really like this brand. Have never had any problems with it with baby.
3263;Great low carb no sugar snack;I bought these b/c I am on phase 3 of HCG and they are great.  They are a little salty though.
3264;HB;Excellent for dental health - cats go crazy for it. Price is best I've found, but still pricey.
3265;Jules Destrooper Almond Thins review;These snacks are so delicious! Sadly during the shipping there was minimal cracking of the small crackers. Although it isn't an issue to me because my family and I just eat them plain
3266;Hot stuff!;My husband is Indian and likes his food very spicy.  Even he can only use 1-2 drops PER MEAL of this stuff.
3267;The BEST!!!!!!!!!;The jelly beans are absolutely fantastic. I was set people up and ask if they want so, well of course they do.
3268;great for keeping family fingers out of the cookie jar;I love these 6 packs. I have three kids and I can easily make a snack bag for school with 2 each.
3269;GOOD SPICE, HOWEVER NAME IS GARLIC & PEPPER BUT HAS MORE SPICE'S IN IT!;Hi, I love this spice, however it is called and sold as garlic pepper! The true mix of ingredients of this mix also includes 1)Sea Salt 2)red bell pepper 3)Green bell pepper 4) Garlic 5) Black pepper ..
3270;coffee lover;This coffee to me did not live up to it's name. I was expecting a lot stronger coffee.
3271;Great Healthy Snack;These cereal bars are great.  The ones with strawberry and blueberry are the best.
3272;My favorite Coffee;"This is my favorite coffee.  I like a strongly flavored brew and this fills the bill and the ""smokey flavor"" is an enhancement I like."
3273;Good Product, but cheaper at Pet Store;I use the Natural Balance Dog Food Rolls low level training treats for my dogs. They seem to like them really well and it doesn't cause the same stomach upset as some of the other treats out there.
3274;Higgins & Burke vs. Twinings;"Earl Grey is not one of my favorite flavors of tea but I really liked this Higgins & Burke version. For point of reference, my favorite black tea is  <a href=""http://www."
3275;Awesome!!;Locally I can not find this variation of penrose products. So when I found them on here I had to get them.
3276;Exactly like Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory Caramel Apples;I ordered this caramel, and in the beginning I made a huge mistake and gave it a 3 rating because even though I thought I was doing everything right-I wasn't. I have learned so much from practicing with my caramel apple maker.
3277;Too much decaf;Over half of my order was decaf coffee. If you don't want decaf coffee I wouldn't reccommend ordering.
3278;Spicy World Madagascar Vanilla Beans;I have been making wonderful homemade vanilla with a recipe that I found on line using vanilla beans purchased from Williams Sonoma. I decided to try Spicy World Vanilla Beans rather than the much more expensive vanilla beans from Williams Sonoma.
3279;Terrific Treats;Our little dog has a very sensitive stomach.  This is the only treat that does not bother him.
3280;Barley Edible - Crunch on Sugar;What more can I say. Barley Edible - Crunch on Sugar.
3281;Mango Macadamia bars are gross;I normally like Kind bars, but the mango flavored ones are way too sweet. I don't even know how to describe the overpowering flavor.
3282;honey tastes great...;The honey tastes great, but unless you really love the taste, the flavor might get a little boring. Other than that, Stinger has the highest calorie count of all other gels out there and it's relatively inexpensive.
3283;Love the Flavor of this tea!;I bought this tea and both my best friend and I love the taste of it.<br />Best Tulsi flavor tea that I have had.
3284;Paul's prunes;Paul Newman gave many gifts to the world.  Lying on his deathbed with images of his life flickering before his fading vision.
3285;Yum, Yum, Yum!;I am really enjoying this herbal coffee. I'm LDS, so I don't normally drink coffee, but I always enjoyed the smell of it.
3286;Can't find Peter Pan Peanut Butter in Southern California Stores!;I've seen studies where Peter Pan Peanut Butter won the taste tests..
3287;Edamame dry roasted;I love the Edamame..
3288;Sediment in every cup;The taste was ok, but every cup ended up having sediment at the bottom of the cup.  I will not be buying this brand again.
3289;Guilt-Free but not that great;I loved the idea of this snack. As others mentioned, enough crunch and volume that it is hard to finish a bag.
3290;A dog's review;These were a little bigger then my owner expected them to be, each treat can be broken in half.<br />I really enjoyed the taste, and spent a good five minutes snuffling the ground after being given the treat to make sure I had not missed any crumbs.
3291;Clear Scalp, Clear Head;I ordered both the Clear Scalp Shampoo and the Conditioner for Damage and Color Repair since I regularly color my dark hair and like to use products that help sustain the color. I typically buy sulfate-free since those seem to work best, and was a little bit surprised that this formula contained sulfates.
3292;Nice snacking;I placed an order with Amazon and was orginally sent the wrong flavored product-I received the banana cinnamon<br />snacks.  I let Amazon know and without any hesitation they sent me the purple pack without any charge.
3293;Wellness Dog Food - - Excellent choice;My dogs had bad skin problems (itchy, flaky, reddness).  Vet wanted to put them on steroids.
3294;Good stuff.;This is the same quality stuff you can get from the gift shops when you travel to Canada or New England. Not all pieces were in their spots, but the candy was soft and fresh.
3295;A great mid-morning or mid-afternoon snack;"This ""cookie bar"" reminds me of a thin strudel. It is soft, but somewhat crisp, with a flaky consistency."
3296;Easy to Recycle Grounds;"The best thing about these cups is that I can just peel off the lid and invert the ""net"" filter to recycle my grounds as plant fertilizer.  With traditional K-cups, I have to scrape the sides to get all the coffee ground out--what a pain."
3297;My Dog Loves The Beef 1oz Beef Steaks;I have a border collie and my husband started to give our dog a jacks beef steak every night as a treat. Now I buy boxes of 24 all the time and the vet says they are better to give then a raw hide or some of the treats in the stores .
3298;great taste, cute shape;I grew up on shredded wheat and loved it. I love this product just as much, maybe more.
3299;Wow where has coconut oil been all my life - just Google the health benefits and be amazed!;This is my first experience with coconut oil. I heard about it and read up online and was amazed at the health benefits.
3300;tasty french vanilla!;have enjoyed drinking this flavor of Van Houtte coffees..
3301;dog loved this! yummy bully;My 40 pound hound loves this product. Also this is an American product.
3302;Delicious!;I don't have a very sophisticated palate when it comes to chocolate, so I might be kind of easy to impress, but I really liked the Scharffen Berger Milk Chocolate Bars.  The chocolate melts nicely in the mouth and does have a hint of caramel in its flavor.
3303;PUNCTURED PACKET;"ONE PACKET HAD A PUNCTURE HOLE IN IT AND ONE PACKET HAD BEEN CUT OPEN<a href=""http://www.amazon."
3304;9 grams  fat in 2 Tablespoons...and lots of sugar. This is mostly palm oil and seasonings.;Ah, it's the old rule that things that taste good are rarely good for you..
3305;Excellent, Very Tasty. Love it!;Tasty. Very restaurant-like.
3306;Everything is Rose-y;This is my first experience with antioxidant-rich white tea.  Also, I like the fair trade and organic labels.
3307;Good stuff, just get it locally to save money;I've always had better luck with Red Star than any other yeast for machine bread baking.  And buying a two pound package is a lot cheaper than the store bought 4 oz.
3308;Awesome tea bursting with flavor;Sometimes more is NOT better.  In this instance, however, double the bergamot IS FAR superior to regular Earl Grey tea.
3309;Buy It;This is the best muesli I have ever tried.  I would buy it if it wasn't healthy.
3310;Our favorite brownies;I tend to doctor the recipe a bit, either adding sunflower butter as part of the fat, or using almond milk and almond extract, adding pecans, or what have you, but we use this in lieu of cake for some birthdays. It makes great cupcakes (I just made some tonight.
3311;K-cup holder;I got what I paid for. It was exactly what I wanted.
3312;Great chocolate flavor in convenient packaging;I'm a frequent purchaser of milk in asceptic packages.  I find the packaging to be incredibly convenient for our family of two, to avoid waste due to spoilage.
3313;and a half stars - Not as good as I hoped but teenagers loved them!;"I've always liked Chips Ahoy! cookies and was excited to try these ""gooey"" ones!!  What could be better with chocolate chip cookies than more chocolate?  Unfortunately, for me, they just fell flat.  The chocolate ""gooey"" part was not very soft or, well, gooey and there wasn't much flavor to it, in my opinion."
3314;Counter top gardening;Bought used only problem it was poorly packed with all 3 grow lights broke.  Up and running now with little sprouts.
3315;Vegan Organic Raw Choice;Vegan. Organic.
3316;Meal Replacement Bars;My husband is on a Doctor supervised medical meal replacement diet.  I'm doing it with him with over the counter products.
3317;Great coffee;I use 1 box of 50 kcups per month on amazons autoship and I love it. Good coffee for good price.
3318;Messy and apparently undelicious;My cat is not a huge fan. Sure, she'll lap up the gravy, but leaves the little meat-like bits as dry as a bone.
3319;Delicious;I love Sprite Zero it literally tastes just like regular Sprite but minus the calories.<br />What more needs to be said?<br />Yummy.
3320;Louisiane style coffee;Myy wife and I always bought Louizianne coffee for years.  Lately the rice sky-highed where we bought it.
3321;The Best Macaroni and Cheese ever!!;I absolutely love this mac and cheese it is different from any other 'squeeze cheese' style of mac and cheese i've had as the cheese is white. The cheese is soooo good.
3322;Outstanding;Outstanding product.  The flavor really hits the spot.
3323;Delicious! Brilliant product concept;LOVE this iced tea -- so refreshing! I think this is a brilliant concept for a product because it's convenient and easy to use. I can't believe this is so hard to find in stores but I'm thrilled it's on Amazon.
3324;Easy and Tasty;Easy to make without a bread maker and very tasty.  It's good with everything, but we especially like it for breakfast toasted with butter and honey.
3325;A New Favorite;Zevia is like an answer to prayers. I've been using stevia in drinks for quite a few years but avoid most sodas due to their high sugar content or artificial sweeteners.
3326;Tasty;I used this mix to make a 9x13 cake in a glass pan using grapeseed oil, spring water, and free range eggs.  I thought the cake had a nice flavor to it but it was not what I was expecting.
3327;crystal light;I have this mailed to my mother on a regular basis.  Sometime this is the only way to get her to drink water.
3328;delicious;It is great thin and tasty brown rice. Just follow the recipe on the packet and it cooks perfect.
3329;Delicious tea, full, but refined taste-good cold or hot;I really enjoy peppermint tea. It is often hard to find quality tea bags with this flavor.
3330;This stuff rocks!;My kids love this stuff!  A little goes a long way.  Very tasty.
3331;Excellent water!;I thought Fiji would be as good as it gets for clean, hydrating water. I was wrong! I tried this water on a whim, bought a whole case.
3332;Uncle Sam's Products rule;Our 40 pound dog just loves these Chicken Drummets. The price here on Amazon is also quite reasonable.
3333;Inconsistent in product quality;This is my fist batch from amazon of the salmon and chicken formula. Purchase 3 cases from another pet food store and our cat loved it.
3334;Wonderful solution for the dairy restricted love one in your life.;My eight year old daughter is allergic to dairy and Cherrybrook Original Pancake Mix is the answer to our frustration.  I've tried many homemade recipes for pancakes without egg/milk with little success.
3335;That's a spicy!;If you've tried the conventional Kettle crinkle chip verson Salt and Peper, you CAN'T compare these to those!  These are easily some of the most spicy chips you will ever eat, but oompletely enjoyable.  You finish the bag and the indside is just coated with spices.
3336;Better than Kick A$$ Dark;I've been taste-testing a few different coffees on Amazon: this one, Kicking Horse's Kick A$$ Dark, and several of Raven's Brews.  This one has the best flavor so far for my taste: strong, rich, smoky, and low acid.
3337;Ooey gooey goodness!;Nothing will ever beat the taste of a fresh warm homemade cookie. Chips Ahoy Chewy Gooey Chocofudge will help you satisfy your sweet tooth even if it isn't homemade.
3338;Picky cat loves it!;We have an 11-year-old cat that has been eating Purina salmon and tuna for most of his life.  He has always thrown up food at least 3 times a week and I thought it was just something we had to put up with.
3339;The real stuff;This is the real German potato dumpling. I enjoyed it very much.
3340;Good tea;"This is very good tea, in a nice ""split"" teabag.<br />What more can I say?  Jasmine green tea, sweetened with a little stevia, is a wonderful drink."
3341;Dont Recommend;I started on the hcg diet recently and thought miracle noodles would be my favorite thing. I can eat pasta by itself and really like ramen noodles as well.
3342;yummy;I prefer mild to medium coffee and I've tried so many different k-cups but I'll stay with this one the other reviews were right on , smooth and not any bitterness. Just a great cup of joe.
3343;Good quality coffee;Coffee tastes great on the small mug setting(7.25 oz), anything beyond that is too weak for me - unless you use 2 K-cups & brew each one on the 5.
3344;Tuna. Just like it says.;If you like Tuna, then you love these. Pre-Made (mixed) with mayo.
3345;Not For Me, thank you!;"First, being the age that I am, I certainly do remember my father making ginger ""tea"" and putting lemon in it with sugar (actually, he used molasses) and drinking it warm. As a child I thought this simply weird and dreadful!<br /><br />Later, with maturity, etc."
3346;what a buy!;the flavor is great. it's not packed with too much water.
3347;Excellent product but needed newer style of nutrients;This is the second one that I bought.  One as a gift for a friend and one as a gift for my wife.
3348;A good-tasting gimmick;"Marketers know that if they slap ""pure"" and ""natural"" on anything, there's a segment of consumer that's automatically going to snarf them up.  Well, at least the people behind these bars seem to be doing it without cynicism."
3349;best little snack ever;sometimes you just want something to nibble on..
3350;WONDERFUL!!;I absolutely love this stuff!!!  It would be wonderful on just about anything - grilled chicken, hamburger patties, steak, burritos.  It has an amazing taste, not hot at all.
3351;a stinky teat my Bella loves;they are tiny and stinky but my Bella just loves them. she will do anything for them, sit, lay jump play dead and she is only ten weeks old.
3352;Raspberry yes, chocolaty No;I was always a big fan Of Gloria Jeans Raspberry chocolate beans as they made a wonderful cup of coffee and the house smelled so good just from having the beans around.  When I saw the Van Houtte Chocolate Raspberry I ordered it hopping to have the same great flavor and aroma.
3353;Great service.  Good, solid beef jerky;This beef jerky is good and solid.  I use the word solid because it is not moist.
3354;I NEED these in United Kingdom (UK);i need these to be available in the UK!<br />End..
3355;Product of China!?;If I had known this was from China, I never would have ordered it.  I know it's difficult to avoid products made in China but I will not knowingly buy food from China.
3356;Just like HOME;I just love this strong blend of teas, PG Tips was given to me as a gift and I have searched for it until I had the good sense and good luck to find it on Amazon.com.
3357;Good Stuff!;I find this to be an excellent product for anyone who likes tasty rice.  It can be used like any other white rice and has a delightful aroma.
3358;Great dog treats;These treats are reasonably priced, high quality, and great for training. The ones on the bottom can be crumbly but it's handy that they're easy to break up.
3359;not the same thing;These are NOT the pearls. These are the hard sharp chunks that neither my maine coon kitty or I enjoy stepping on.
3360;was ok;I guess I was looking for a more tomato based type of chowder. The taste was fine just not what I was hoping for.
3361;Best pretzels, except my husband won't stop eating them...;I love these pretzel except I have to hide them from my husband. They're light tasting and almost a hint of butter tasting.
3362;Too much aftertaste;We eat mostly gluten free as one of my kids has a sensitivity to it. While I try to bake all the goods myself, these looked like a good thing to carry as a snack when we travel.
3363;After Seven Days...;This review is for the Clear Scalp & Hair Beauty Strong Lengths Nourishing Shampoo & Conditioner, written after using these products for seven days.<br /><br />I should start by saying that I consider this an inexpensive product.
3364;Freeze-Dried Veggies;The taste and flavor was very good, however they were burned black and did not look very nice. I suspect they sold them on Amazon since we could not inspect them before buying them.
3365;More than just a cooking oil!;I love this product! I use it on my hair, face, and body. I love the smell.
3366;Better than Panera's Tomato Soup!!;This is the BEST tomato soup!!  It has small chunks of tomato in which give it such a homemade flair to it.  The taste is pure tomato and has a very smooth, velvety feel to it.
3367;Meh;Not that good, and it does have a very very strong taste. I think this would be my last resort coffee.
3368;Good coffee substitute with reservations...;I am on a lower carb eating routine and wanted to cut out some caffeine as well.  I bought a bag of light roast Teeccino as it was available locally to be sure I like it.
3369;hated them;I understand many people love these things, but I bought the sea salt and vinegar popchips and I hated them. I LOVE regular  potato chips lay's and other brands.
3370;MovieBuff-VA;I use fructose for anything that calls for sugar.  I use it in baking and for everyday items.
3371;dog food;My Boxer likes this brand a lot, especially the Duck flavor. She is a finicky eater and it took a while to find a food she really likes.
3372;Nice Blend;This is a very good blend if you like your coffee strong and dark.  It has a very nice flavor that's a bit earthy and smooth.
3373;Great Coffee;This is a great coffee if you like it a little on the strong side, but smooth.  I was surprised that it came in a plastic bag as opposed to a sealed box, but none-the-less, it was good.
3374;A blessing;These little wonders make it a pleasure to give required medication to your dog. They work and work well.
3375;Sinfully delicious without the guilt;You would never know that these are fat free brownies based on the taste and texture. The best part is that the mix can be used to make single portions, perfect for people like me who like a yummy baked good as an occasional treat but don't want the temptation of an entire pan of brownies.
3376;Just OK;First time trying these and I dont think I would buy them again for the price. Having said that I am going to try other hulled seeds to see if they taste better.
3377;Very pleased, but bought it in store;The flavor is very good. Works great for baking and frying.
3378;Sooo Good;I really love these bars.  I prefer them more than name brand candy bars and they are good for you!  They came quickly and I had no problems with signs of melting in transit as I had with other nutrition bars.
3379;Word up;It's simply very good instant coffee if you have a need. Really tastes like fresh brewed coffee.
3380;My Favorite Gum;This is my very favorite chewing gum but is no longer available in any retail outlets that I can find. Amazon is the only place I can find it.
3381;Buy it - you will like it !;My wife has been eating this cereal every day for over a year.  She loves it and is becoming more healthy in the process.
3382;Most Excellent Organic yellow corn chips. Great with homemade salsa.;We love these organic corn chips. They have an excellent crunch big chips great for dipping.
3383;Soft Tasty Oatmeal Cookie;"The <a href=""http://www.amazon."
3384;Enormous pricing, should be illegal.;This store should be dumped by Amazon, what a price they have for this product $10.00 a pound, in stores it is less than a 1/4 of this price, are they going to make it in front of you? Please double check other sources before you order from this supplier.
3385;"lost one bag of my ""jack link's"" beef jerky";"I am a regular subscriber of this ""Jack Link's"" beef jerky terriyaki. This morning, I opened the new box from Amazon and found that there are only 9 bags in the box while it supposed to be 10."
3386;Try Supreme Stevia Instead...;Before trying Truvia, I purchased the Supreme Stevia in the loose powder form and I loved it! So I purchased Truvia to use at work for my coffee and tea
3387;First review for a product worth it;I typically do not find enough time to write a review about a product on Amazon but I thought Jaipur Avenue definitely deserved it. After moving to Seattle, I realized I didn't have a lot of options for instant chai powder - something I used to get fairly easily in Chicago.
3388;Not As Balanced As Other Bold Flavors, But Not Bad;"I went out on a limb trying Blue Diamond Almonds Bold - Wasabi & Soy flavor.  I had never had wasabi before, but I have like many of the other ""Bold"" flavors Blue Diamond makes (Jalapeno Smokehouse and Habanero BBQ) so I decided to give them a try."
3389;Bno calorie sweetner;splenda is not only foe coffee or tea.<br />any cake,bread, muffin,pancake recipe you can use splenda in place of sugar.
3390;Very good oatmeal!;I love this oatmeal for several reasons.  They include:<br /><br />1.
3391;What's with the salt?;"When I received this item it was labeled ""Sea Salt."" In  fact, the Sea Salt version of these chips is also described as ""lightly salted,"" so you might think the two were one and the same."
3392;DOG LOVES THESE;I tried Greenies on my dog about 8 years ago and he won't eat them.  So I tried dental rawhide chews which he chewed just fine.
3393;My Favorite Bar of All;I saw this amazing combination in a healthy bar at Starbucks.  I am a mango fanatic so ANYTHING with mangoes rule!  I was not disappointed!  Mangoes, Macadamia nuts and coconut in 1 bar?  Heaven!  I turned on several of my co-workers to these and plus they have folate and calcuim, which were not in the bars prior.
3394;Exactly what I was looking for!;This Chai hits the spot perfectly and for a great cost combined with the simplicity of only needing to add water.  Yes, I will admit it is not as smooth as a Starbucks Chai Latte if you just make it like I do with nothing but hot water and no frother, etc.
3395;My dog loves these Zukes!;I got these treats because we needed chewy treats that our soft-coated wheaten terrier puppy could eat quickly during training. We had a lot of the cookie type treats earlier but it took too long for him to break apart the dry treats and lick up the crumbs.
3396;Brownies :-);This is twelve boxes of brownie mix. After sub & save, it is less than what I would pay at the store.
3397;Joining Everyone Else - This Stuff Is Great!;I just made my first batch of Butter Chicken Curry. It's terrific!<br /><br />It's extremely easy to prepare - just mix the paste with 1 cup water, 3 Tbs butter, 1 lb chicken pieces, and simmer for 20 minutes with a 5 minute high burner finish.
3398;Nutrition label incorrect on website;"I have been using this product for almost 2 years now and when I received my tub with the new label, I noticed that it has 120 calories. The ""old"" label listed 90 calories."
3399;Great coffee.;This is my everyday coffee now.  The roast is dark, just how I like it.
3400;FIVE STAR SOUP*****;WE HAD ORDERED THE VARIETY PACK OF THE SOUTHWEST SOUPS ALSO FROM THIS COMPANY AND THIS ONE WAS OUR FAVORITE. THEY WERE ALL GREAT, BUT THIS ONE WAS TOPS.
3401;Easy to make and enjoy;I have been enjoying my coffee maker and pods for years.  The Senso dark roast is one of the best flavor of pods I have tried.
3402;A Great Specimen in Need of Carefull Pruning;The Kingsville Boxwood is considered by many to be the granddaddy of deciduous bonsai. This one arrived securely without one single peanut, a welcome first for Brussel's.
3403;Great product, just a little pricey compared to other baby food;If you want/need convenience, this item is fabulous!  We always rate the organic baby food pouches high and our only concern is the price.  We find the pouches great for taking to restaurants, in the car, on picnics, to the zoo, etc.
3404;Yummy to the tummy;We used to have drive down to the specialty pet food store for this product.  So glad we discovered Amazon.
3405;Great tasting coffee;
3406;I'm addicted!;I always have a pocketful of these with me at work.  I'm hooked!  I used to be a smoker and being able to pop a fireball in my mouth drastically cuts down on cravings at work.
3407;better than a company;I paid lots of money to have a service place these in my home. Unless you want to spray poison, it's the best way to get these moths.
3408;i'm spoiled now;Hard to go back to standard salt after discovering the wonder that is fleur de sel. It makes everything taste better.
3409;Would give 5 stars if there were less parts!;Great bottle!  I feel much safer using a glass bottle over plastic anyday.  My baby appears to like these bottles over the smaller plastic bottles I was using before.
3410;no more stale chips;i like nachos. i don't like stale chips.
3411;Great function and looks great too!;This case holds a lot and can still fold up well. Great function and looks nice too.
3412;Daughter-in-law and I LOVE these!;My daughter-in-law, Tyra, and I were recently at Lincoln City on the Oregon Coast, and were checking out of a store when I spied the Tillamook Pepperoni sticks.  I bought a couple for both of us and we couldn't stop talking about how good they were!  I decided then and there that I would search out the container with these tasty pepperoni sticks.
3413;Very good taste, only slightly sweet. One point deducted for all the crumbs.;This brand of graham crackers is decidedly less sweet than the other types that I have had over the years. I like this less sweet flavor and can see it being paired with toppings that might not go well with sweeter crackers.
3414;Love everything about it but the pine dust;Have been using feline pine with our three cats for nearly five years. The only thing I don't like about it is the pine dust that your left with once the pellets get wet and break down.
3415;Great Licorice;This Lucky Country Licorice is some of the best we've tried. It's rich tasting, soft and not too sweet.
3416;"May be the ""Ultimate"" Treat";I can't believe the excitement that these bring to my two dogs day, My brother's dog and a friend's dog. Every one of them goes nuts.
3417;Short on pesto, long on onion.;I thought this would be an interesting take on pesto sauce which is a favorite in our house. There were some green bits in the sauce but so few that I'm not sure why it is called pesto sauce.
3418;strong;Not waterproof and very strong! We use it for walks in the woods.  Has high concentrate of deet, and thats a little concerning.
3419;Healthy and Good Tasting;This oil is very healthy with vitamins A, B, D and E.It's high in Omega-3.
3420;Great!;Great!And drink coffee in the store, and the price is very affordable.I would like my future will continue to buy.
3421;Great candy;These are great.  It's weird, but if I'm hungry in the afternoon and not near any food, I suck on one of these and my hunger pains are gone for a couple of hours, plus they taste great.
3422;A *true* protein bar, does NOT contain hydrogenated oils!;My wife and I love these Power Crunch bars!  They have a great protein content and are low carb, which is great for our current exercise and diet routine.  Contrary to what's listed above, it does *not* contain hydrogenated *anything.
3423;Barbeque perfection;The barbeque flavor of these chips is really perfect! Just spicy enough, a hint of sweetness, just a little smokey. The chips themselves are extra crunchy and just thick enough to be substantial, but not hard.
3424;Delicious!;My husband is addicted to chai tea lattes, and paying $5.00 a day at the coffee shop is not an option.
3425;Kinda chalky, Go with Happy Melts;I was super excited to see these at Safeway for only $3. I have seen them at other places for as much as $4.
3426;Great!;Tings are awesome.  They taste like cheese doodles with no gluten and no dairy.
3427;Excellent training treats;These treats are small and are perfect for training treats. Plus, my dog absolutely loves them.
3428;Good;I did like these cookies but I didn't love them. They don't have a weird aftertaste or crumbly texture, but the flavor just wasn't perfect for me.
3429;Good Granola;Really good granola.<br /><br />Because I prefer my granola in chunks, I wish  it would stay that way a bit longer in the bag.
3430;Not the best;I love Cherimoyas. The flavor, the taste, what's not to like.
3431;Great Snack for Kids (& Moms) on the go!;I tried Little Duck Mango & Strawberry and was very happy with the clean, bright taste of the chunks.  My 2yo gobbled up the cup I gave her and asked for more.
3432;The coffee that speaks back;This is a bold coffee that, unlike the strong coffee served at some major coffee shops, is not overburned to create that taste.  It is consistant and the K-cups make the who process definitely worth it.
3433;Great Value;For those of you who like the taste and convenience of Starbucks VIA, this is a great deal.  I've replaced a trip to Starbucks with a cup of VIA in the morning.
3434;Delicious!;Great for salads or pasta. And so convenient! I don't need to go to the store to pick it up.
3435;TOO MANY GRAINS!;As soon as the ingredients were mostly GRAINS I read no more.  The first 1-4 should be PROTEIN, not grains.
3436;Weak cider flavor, strong artificial sweetener flavor;I guess you get what you pay for..
3437;Great Relaxer;We have used Natural Calm for some time now, drinking it hot each night.  Finding the item on Amazon makes it easier and less expensive to enjoy.
3438;Great,healthy, tasty treats dogs love!;My dogs love these. They are not grain free, but they have no wheat, corn or soy and no artificial preservatives.
3439;Good Purchase!;I was surprised how small these slim jim sticks were but that worked out okay.  They are not the healthiest snack so eating it in small doses is good!  They are easy to store in the dispensable box and I won't run out any time soon, making my son a very happy boy.
3440;Sorry---Awful Taste;I couldn't believe this was from Emeril.<br /><br />His products have always been so good.
3441;a magical little dollop of pure flavor;I've been buying this in little 1.6 oz packages for a long time now, so I was delighted to find this larger size available here.
3442;Quality dog food;I like this a lot for my 12 y/o cardigan welsh corgi.  She needed a little more protein in her diet and I've added this to the Solid Gold Holistiquez and it's working well.
3443;coffee;I was expecting it to have a stronger flavour, but still is delicious. when i want it to be stronger, i just set the cup size smaller so the flavour is more intense.
3444;Um... I love a less popular, older candybar?;I had a tradition, when I went to my hardware store - buying a Whatchamacallit from the only store in town that carried them. They stopped.
3445;Super Chocolatey;This sipping chocolate is super rich and chocolately.  I actually have to add more milk in it than the instructions indicate because it's actually too rich if I don't.
3446;Not Impressed;I bought this online, willing to try a new matcha. I'm not impressed with the quality for the price.
3447;Exactly what I wanted.;I have been trying to drink more tea with stevia in it in order to cut down on diet sodas with other sweeteners in them. After hearing the advantages of cinnamon as a appetite suppressant and how it controls the blood sugar, I have also been adding more cinnamon to my diet.
3448;Good flavor but...;"The overall flavor is pretty good (esp. for being vegetarian) and the texture was fine but, the one I tried, ""original wild"" was just TOO (spicy) hot! I don't mind a little heat but this was rediculous."
3449;Light Roast. Mild Blend. Smooth Flavor. Not Acidic. Not Full Bodied.;This Donut House Blend is a light roast coffee. It is not bitter & has a mild flavor.
3450;Yummy but not my fav.;I got the pineapple, mango and choco. My family liked the latter 2 the most.
3451;These are OK;"I love Pamela's products but these cookies are little too ""coffeey"" for my taste.  My husband doesn't care too much for them either."
3452;A nice coffee treat for only 100 calories!;I'm a big coffee drinker, but with the amount of calories found in most ready-to-drink coffee/ espresso drinks, I often shy away from them. However, I was pleasantly surprised to find the illy issimo Coffee Drink.
3453;my mother's favorite cookie;I have yet to try this product personally, because it is not currently available at our supermarket. But my mother,  soon will be 94, mildly diabetic and a long-time customer for sugar-free products, says they are the best! For some reason our store carries the other Murray varieties, but not this one any more, maybe because there are so many kinds.
3454;Wild Mountain Blueberry K-cup;Love, Love, Love it! This taste like a blueberry candy, if you like blueberry you will love this k-cup.  It is a sweet brew, and great with alittle cream.
3455;Expensive but Excellent, The Only Food My Boxer Has Loved;Pros: Endless list i.e.
3456;BROADWAY DRIED FRUIT ROUND BASKET-MEDIUM;I BOUGHT THIS FOR MY MOM. I RRECENTLY ASKED HER IF SHE LIKED IT? AT FIRST SHE HESITATED BUT EVENTUALLY SAID THAT 3/4 TH OF THE FRUITS WERE VERY DRY AND TOUGH.
3457;My Puppies love them.;I have tried this bones before from local stores that charge 3 and 4 times as much for them.  That is even after you add in shipping.
3458;Misleading Picture On Package;Based on the ranting and raving of a traveling acquaintance I thought I'd try these COMPLEATS meals ..
3459;YUMMY;I absolutely love these cookies.  I don't like things that are overly sweet and if I<br />eat cookies, they have to be crisp - no chewy cookies for me.
3460;A yummy treat for the office;Our office staff love this strong bold coffee.  It is a 2 in the afternoon favorite.
3461;Very tasty;Not exactly perfect for extreme low-carb dieting, but still good enough compared to your average sugar-infused muffin mix. Flavor is pretty good, though the muffins are lacking something to round them off, but they are moist and have a good texture.
3462;worst feeling ever!;"I decided to try 5 hour energy after it was recommended to me by my Dad. I have been drinking ""Go Girls"" for a while and I loved them."
3463;Ugh so not what I was expecting >.&lt;
3464;Good stuff;Easy to make and great to add to any tea or juice.  I like this brand in the regular boba better.
3465;i don't like this flavors;Bought these for the office and they were gone before I knew it. The pops are good as always but I do not like the new flavors.
3466;Nice twist to regular shortbread;Yes, this is yet another great item from Walkers.  Just wish they weren't so expensive.
3467;Dried chicken strips made in China;Due to all the publicity surrounding the questionable quality of dried chicken strips from China, I have thrown out this order (it is not worth the money to return it).  I will not be reordering them.
3468;No comparison;I bought this at Costco originally because it was on sale. I don't like that steel cut oats normally take like 20 minutes to cook.
3469;Pamela's Gluten Free Baking Mix;This is simply the best gluten free baking mix, and Amazon's amazing pricing makes it affordable.  A few very enthusiastic thumbs-up.
3470;Dog loves them, but I hate the smell;I have a 70 pound lab mix, and he goes nuts for these treats. He'll devour one in less than 5 minutes, but it's awesome to see him so happy.
3471;Love this Bread;I have made 3 loafs of this already.  But this time beside raisins I also added Dried Cranberrys.
3472;Almond Biscotti;The Pan Ducale Bastoncini Almond Biscotti are less than 1/2 the size of a regular or normal biscotti.  However, they are very tasty and of good quality.
3473;Heavenly;Words escape me when I bite into one of these scrumptious chocolates.  First of all, they are large - easily 2 bites worth.
3474;Not better than liquid milk;Here is a comparison of liquid,organic milk and organic valley organic nonfat dry milk powder. 16 servings of liquid milk costs $5.
3475;Super Awesome;You have to get this if you bake! This makes the BEST pie crust and biscuits ever. We also switched from  butter to coconut oil for frying eggs and it requires a lot less to get the job done.
3476;What Great Flavor!;Can I just say..
3477;Nice set;This was a lovely gift hamper. It is small and sweet and can be given to anyone.
3478;Great taste and size;O.N.
3479;Similar to NOS or Orangina in flavor.;There isn't a lot to say about an energy drink.  This particular No Fear drinks follows the well charted waters of other similar 16oz energy drinks in composition and expected level of effectiveness.
3480;"WHO KNEW? - It actually is ""Good til the last drop""";My husband is the coffee drinker, I just love the aroma!  He loves this coffee and I purchased this big box of it to save money and I sure did.  It won't be the last box I buy from Amazon.
3481;LOVE these!;I ordered these because I was looking for a healthier version of regular graham crackers since my toddler loves them and I didn't like constantly giving him something that I knew was full of high-fructose corn syrup and without any real nutritional value. He loves these crackers! And, I have to say that I think they taste MUCH better than regular graham crackers as well! I will actually take and eat these as a snack myself.
3482;A delicious 'tonic-like' tea;I was introduced to this tea at a local restaurant and went absolutely crazy about it. Its unique flavor and healthifying blend of green and black teas and yerba mate, along with a light touch of ginger, is a wonderful thirst quencher.
3483;Fantastic chocolates;We tried (and retried very may times :) these chocolates in Belgium, and they are fantastic. I do like Neuhaus chocolates better, but these are also way up there.
3484;great for visitors;If you're like me, you like what you like, and often keep going back to the same tea again and again.  Whether you want to change things up a bit, without committing to buying an entire box or you want to provide a variety of choices for friends, this will take care of you.
3485;healthy treat;This bar is the perfect snack for late afternoon or whenever you feel lethargic or hungry, especially when you know you are eating something good for your body. I guess they are a bit expensive, but for a product that has added antioxidants, and is gluten free, i guess that's about right.
3486;Great Formula for my picky baby!;My daughter was exclusively breastfed until she was 6 months. We tried weaning her earlier, but she refused other formulas we tried.
3487;Misrepresentation;The problem is not with the candy. Amazon pictures a christmas box but instead you get the regular white box.
3488;Best Dog Food Ever!!;This is the best dog food you could ever feed your dog.  I have a 12 year old German Shorthair Pointer and she's been eating Tast of the Wild for about a year now, and her coat is beautiful, shiny healthy,  she acts like a 2 year old, full of energy and spunk.
3489;Christmas gift;This product arrived quick, and I plan on giving this as a Cristmas gift. It was the exact type (ground, medium) that I ordered and a great price as well.
3490;buy local, and also avoid financing an Occupation;I found this only average for making falafels. But then I read about  the company, OSEM, based in Israel--and decided that our American products, FANTASTIC and CASBEH, both of actually better quality, will get my future business.
3491;At least it wasn't expensive.;"With <a href=""http://www.amazon."
3492;Good caviar at a great price;I enjoy so much the caviar I get from the salad bar when I go to the Chart House Restaurant in Redondo Beach, Ca, that I asked what the name and brand of the caviar they used. I found it on Amazon.
3493;Only fragments, no whole leaf;I purchased 4 boxes of these from Costco. Uncle Lee's tea is part of a well known tea company in China, Ten Fu, which was founded by the founder of the renowned Ten Ren tea company in Taiwan.
3494;For when I'm going decaf;I like the flavor of this tea.  It is not subtle in any way.
3495;Caution: Habit Forming!;These are healthy, delicious, crunchy fruit snacks. All the flavors are fabulous, don't miss the Cherry Berry!<br />Amazon is the best place to buy them (I've shopped around) can't beat the price not to mention free freight over $25.
3496;BEST. GUM. EVER.;This is the absolute best gum flavor ever.  It really tastes like Key Lime Pie and the flavor lasts a long time.
3497;Another great product from Kleins' Naturals;These are apricot fruit leather-type snacks, in round form
3498;A GREAT TASTING REFRESHING GUM;I have used this product for about two years now and it is among the best bargains if you are a gum chewer. The best price that I found is at Walmart where they have an even larger size dispenser and refill bags which are even more economical so that you do not have to buy another dispenser barrel every time.
3499;My preferred mountain Blue Blend.;"I've been alternating between this and the <a href=""http://www.amazon."
3500;fanasticly delicious!;These Zingers are far better than any twinkie or cup cake. They are so delicious they are addictive and i ate a whole box of them in one day.
3501;Well it's okay, but...;Based on the positive reviews, I was excited about this product. UPS deemed the first shipment undeliverable, so I just received my reorder today.
3502;Wow..all this and truffles too!;We used this as a sauce for homemade pizza!  Wow is the only thing I can say about this product.  The truffle essence was delicate and married perfectly with the artichoke.
3503;Impressive Decaf;I managed to taste this before purchasing and I have to say, in taste and character, it is easily equal to its non-decaffeinated counterparts. It makes a hearty cup with no bitter aftertaste.
3504;Elvis the non-hound dog approves...and so do we!;"Like everything else these days, even dog treats are going green, high-tech, and health-conscious!  Just look at the product description for these chew treats!  We have a 2-yo golden/Labrador retriever mix, the best dog we've ever had, and while the unusual makeup of these goodies gave him brief pause to consider, he was chowing down heartily before too long.  And the best news is, as a breath mint they affirmatively do the job!  No more doggie breath!  And it's a pleasant coincidence that Zoe (a Greek word for ""life"") is a family name shared by my mom and HER mom, so that's a nice touch that you don't care about but I wanted to mention to pad out this review."
3505;This tea made me single;My ex is trying to sue this tea for alienation of affection.  I the day I received my first box, I dumped my significant other and never looked back.
3506;Just Average...;It's summertime and I have dry hair and scalp resulting in an itchy head.  This product has not made it any better but it's not any worse either.
3507;Wonderful seasoning salt - give it a try.;I use this porcini salt in many savory dishes - cooked entrees and salads. Delicious.
3508;Great price for stale coffee.;The quantity and quality were as advertised, but the age of the pack of coffee was old. The beans were dry as a bone.
3509;Delivers what was promises;Wolfgang Puck's Chef's Reserve Colombian (Dark Roast) is basically what they said it will be. Dark roast, but not too strong.
3510;Six dollars and thirty-tree cents...;Is what EACH box of these costs if you buy them here.  $6.
3511;yummy and healthy;My preschooler LOVES these fruit snacks!  They are organic and have no added sugar.  I have tasted these myself, and they are really good.
3512;Not so Tender...and Very Dry;I purchased this as an option for my cat since he only eats chicken. This is a much drier and diced product (no juice) as compared to the other Whiskas products in a pouch.
3513;For those on a GFCF diet, these are great;These cookies are great for kids on the GFCF diet. My daughter loved them.
3514;Very mild...;I love this tea and will be purchasing it again. But I do not brew it alone.
3515;The worst 'tea' I have ever tried.;I used quotes around the word tea because I doubt that the bags contain tea.  I wouldn't be surprised if the bags contained ground up sticks instead of tea.
3516;SEA SALE;Appreciate the availability of this product, cost and quality, has made this purchase, a reason for shopping Amazon.com.
3517;Chicken chips and tenderloins are better;My dogs loved the beef and chicken rolls in the snack mix, but really didn't like the dried pig skin or whatever it was that seemed to make up the bulk of the snacks.  There was a lot of flavoring and seasoning added that is really not needed for real meat products.
3518;A perfect treat!;We were given a partial bag of these treats by a friend who no longer needed them. Our Boston Terrier loved them! Upon researching the product, and finding them to be a good product as well as a good bargain, we purchased 2 cases of them.
3519;The Taste of Home;I am a native New Orleanean, far from home. Italian Olive Salad, New Orleans style, is an essential ingredient in many recipes, from muffaletta to pasta.
3520;Flea Trap Paper;I received the flea traps five and the waxed paper would not peal off so I could use them two per trap 12 total. You have to peel off top wax paper to reveal the sticky trap no luck.
3521;Swanson Blackstrap Molasses capsules;My wife has had an anemia problem for years. One of these capsules per day appears to have taken care of the problem.
3522;nice twist on the original;I love plain cheerios but sometimes a little cheerio diversity is called for.  The banana nut flavor is not overly sweet and there is a distinctive banana taste, almost a slightly burnt banana taste.
3523;PB2;I like the powdered PB2
3524;HORRIBLE I CANT BELIEVE THIS!;Terrible! I cannot believe this, I received this item and EVERY SINGLE BAG WAS OPENED BUT 4!!!! I'm stationed in Afghanistan and this was gonna be a snack for my team while going out on missions. I was so embarrassed when the bags were opened and spilt out all in the box, gross! And the box is filled with grease stains.
3525;Feeding it in my boarding kennel....excellent investment;Although I do not buy Canidae through Amazon, I wanted to rave about it's quality.  I am a dealer and own and operate a pet boarding facility.
3526;Very good, fine flavor, strong pick me up effect;This variety of tea has a stronger pick me up effect than the Oruro<br />and the Caranavi varieties that I previously got from the same seller.<br />This tea presents a finer grind and less fiber stems are present.
3527;Bummer, taste like Coca Cola;This is 'my' opinion of this product.  I'm going off of what 'my' taste buds is telling me.
3528;Best Popcorn Ever;I purchased this popcorn to use in my popcorn machine. It pops easily.
3529;Great popcorn at a great price;As a lover of popcorn, over the course of my half century on this planet, I've pretty much run the gamut on the variety of ways to eat this delight -- over the stove, the air popper and then by nuking it. All were fads that faded over time.
3530;Very Good;I am the primary cook in our home and have developed a taste for Thai food during my business travels.  No local restaurants fill this niche so I researched some recipes and found a few that looked good - but they required fish sauce (among other hard to find ingredients).
3531;My Furry Babies Love It.;Well like always delivery just in time. My furry babies love it I highly recomend Fancy feast and again Thank you, Amazon for such great deals.
3532;bad customer service;I ordered these for work and they came all in a box, no problem.<br />There was a problem with some of them being broken and leaking all over.
3533;Love these strawberries;Excellent flavor. Great on cereal or just for a crunchy snack without the grease,fat & calories of chips.
3534;Velveeta Cheesy Skillets - Chicken and Broccoli;This dinner kit is quick and easy. It makes five one cup servings with 390 calories per serving.
3535;Good Coffee, Just too Weak for me.;I like the Big Cup of Coffee for the Morning as well.<br />But I like the Darker Roasts generally.
3536;cats loved it;i opened the can and thought..
3537;A shout-out to those of us who want to maintain a healthy weight!;Due partially to the use of Splenda, Murrays makes the best-tasting sugar free cookies out there.  But don't forget they still have carbs! Chocolate chip is my personal favorite.
3538;My Favorite;I love this in the morning.  Gives you some get up and go without caffeine, although it does taste good when added to coffee.
3539;Nonn's Biscotti, Limone;Nonni's Biscotti, Limone, 8-Count Boxes (Pack of 12)<br /><br />In my opinion, ths is the best biscotti on the market today.  I usually eat at least two each morning with coffee - delicious!!  I also really like the original biscuit without the lemon flavoring.
3540;PEOPLE DROPS;People Drops are terrific! Nothing artificial and natural sweeteners. No side effects at all and they taste great.
3541;My doggies liked it;Liked Zuke's Hip Action Natural Dog Treats, roasted chicken. My dogs liked this and considered it as a treat.
3542;Newman's Own Organic Liver for dogs.;I am not happy with the Organic Liver for dogs.  It is too mushy and should be mixed with dry food.
3543;Thank you Brugger's!;This is the sauce that gives me the unbelieveable craving for a Thai Chicken bagel sandwich with peanut sauce.  Just thinking and talking about it makes my mouth water!!  I have to thank a wonderful employee at one of my local Brugger's for putting to rest the mystery of the peanut sauce they use as it is one of the best I have ever had--and trust me I have tried a few, as well made some to try to replicate this very one.
3544;Filling and Tastes Great;This is one of the best if not the best Kellogg's Cereal in a Cup Assortment. Stay away from the Family Assorment.
3545;They Seem to Like It;Any review of this product, necessarily, must be based upon observation of the four footed furry feline friends (barring any truly dedicated and odd reviewers). We have two cats that deign to call us their owners, at least at feeding time and when the litter box needs cleaning.
3546;Excellent service;A very easy process with good communication and the product exactly as advertised.  I particularly appreciate the packing - very secure.
3547;Love Ginger;If you enjoy a spicy hot taste, these are the best.  I used to buy them, but they are now very hard to find, so I ordered direct.
3548;Great taste and price, but marinade could be better;These olives are marinated. The price I paid was pretty good.
3549;Best Manuka Honey;This is by far the best manuka honey that I have used. We have been using it on a very bad rattlesnake bite on our dog, the vet said if she survived she would probably lose her leg or have to have skin grafts, it has been 32 days and it is close to healed and so far don't see any scarring and all hair is growing back.
3550;delicious and no added sugar!;I would highly recommend these in place of fruit rolls ups or other gummy fruit snacks that are full of sugar. These are all fruit, no added sugar and have a strong, excellent, fruity-tarty taste.
3551;Welcome to addiction;Once you try, you are hooked.  While your supply lasts you will find this to be an enjoyable addition to and diversion from the blandness that is life.
3552;Not as great as I'd hoped;I was told that once I tried this chocolate syrup I would never settle for anything else. Eh.
3553;Pretty much perfect;I LOVE Strawberry!<br /><br />The Strawberry coating is packed with flavour, but because each biscuit is thin, it makes you want to grab another!<br />The Biscuit texture is perfect, and has a hint of sweetness.<br />They'd probably go great with Ice Cream.
3554;Great Taste Great Texture;I absolutely HATE raspberry licorice but this taste more like a raspberry gummy bear. It is fantastic.
3555;Good French Fries;Bought it twice already. Awesome and tasty fries.
3556;Super Fresh High Quality;Very reasonable price for an awesome product. Super Fresh and aromatic, high quality item.
3557;Oh, YUMM!!!;"<a href=""http://www.amazon."
3558;Full of Flavor and Aromatic;This tea surprised me. I tend to like strong flavored teas like Irish breakfast tea, but this light white tea is full of flavor and refreshing without being overpowering.
3559;Sweet - Yes - Great!;This is a great escape from the carbonated bottled Sangrias. They are sweet for sure, but no complaints.
3560;Bleargh! Way too sweet;"The label says ""Go Lean,"" but it should say ""Go Diabetic"" instead. According to the nutritional information, one cup of cereal has 15g of sugar, which is almost 1/4 of the total package! I had one of these for breakfast and it gave me a headache because of the excessive amount of sugar."
3561;Half the team approves - HIGHLY APPROVES;It started with a look.  Them asleep in their beds, me dropping a treat on the floor near them.
3562;Superior Coffee;The timliness and packaging were very well done.  The coffee itself is one of my favorites as I have a taste for Kona however, it seems a bit overpriced considering it's a Kona blend as opposed to a 100% Kona.
3563;Good food, wrong product!!!;I ordered this for my 7 month old who LOVES this food. I ordered the 4.
3564;Weird texture, tastes good;"These are crunchy as they claim, but it's more of any ""airy"" texture. It's hard to explain."
3565;Yuk!;This stuff is disgusting! If I could give this 0 stars, I would. I can't even give this stuff away.
3566;Not safe for kittens!;I don't want anyone to think this is an unfair review of the product, it's more of a warning from my own personal experience so others don't make a mistake.<br /><br />When I got my new kitten from the humane society they sent him home with a goodie bag that happened to include these treats.
3567;Don't buy it here from Vitacost;Oh HOW DARE YOU MAIL ME CHOCOLATE THAT HAS MELTED??!!<br />When I opened the chocolate bar, I could clearly see the cocoa powder separated from the cocoa butter. It is a disaster!!!<br />If I had ordered this and let you Vitacost mail it to my friend, YOU ARE GONNA MESS UP BIG TIME!!!<br /><br />This chocolate bar is the best from chocolove, highly recommended.
3568;Hubby's new favorite !!!;Hubby loves this K cup flavor!  Sometimes difficult to find..
3569;The freshest, fights edema!;This is the first camomile tea that actually maintains the most of the medicinal properties of camomile!! So far it is the best out of five different brands we got to try in USA including various organic, so called farmaceutic quality, etc..
3570;Brothers All Natural Fruit Crisps;I gave some of these fruit crisps to a Vacation Bible School.  With many children, and some food sensitivies, we found that these were no sugar, no preservatives, nothing but pure fruit, these were safe for all the children and were a good healthy snack for everyone.
3571;Great coffee and great service;This is the best coffee I've erver had. Each cup is like fresh groung fresh bean coffee.
3572;Sage Tea - helping with hot flashes;When I bought the first box I had a cup of tea every night and thought the hot flashes subsided a bit, so I bought another box.  The second box, not so much.
3573;My favorite decaf ...;"OK, so I'm under Dr.'s orders to cut down on caffeine, so I've been looking for a good decaf that would match my favorite ""high octane"" coffee."
3574;EZ-FREEZE STAYFIT TM CEREAL ON THE GO;THIS IS THE PERFECT CONTAINER TO USE FOR CEREAL.  IT IS EASY TO USE AND PERFECT TO CARRY TO WORK OR SCHOOL.
3575;Powerful stuff;The strong, spicy aroma (clove and cinnamon dominate) makes this flavor my favorite of the black tea offerings.  Could easily pass for potpourri with it's wonderful bouquet.
3576;Real Cookie Flavor;Unlike many store-bought gluten free baked goods, which have industrial appearances and oily textures, these look and taste like actual cookies.  They have a rich cocoa flavor, with real chocolate chips that crunch pleasantly between the teeth, and a soft but not squishy texture reminiscent of Mom's home-baked brownies.
3577;sticks, is a decent description;Inedible.  I purchased this to hand out for Halloween.
3578;Greenies...a lifesaver!;These are a must if your pet needs medication.  This price seemed a little high, but they are worth it.
3579;Does not meet expectations;Not what Jacob's used to be!<br />This in OK coffee, nothing special.<br />The roast is very mild and mellow, if not somewhat bitter.
3580;I had to say something about it...;"A friend of mine gave me a small bag of this quality corn for my birthday and it is AMAZING! He knew I am a avid fan of popcorn and am always searching for something new. He did mention the hulls and said ""So long as you chew it and NOT try to inhale it, it would be good"" and good it was."
3581;Tastes great, keep you full!;Found them on sale here for roughly $10.50 for box of 12, so it was a better deal than $4.
3582;Great Aroma;
3583;Love it, but I wish $20 got you more...;I ordered this with the intent to add it to smoothies and as a boost to my juicing regimen - so I'll say that the flavor wasn't necessarily a concern with me. I've been drinking odd and awful tasting concoctions in the name of health since I was a child.
3584;Best Taco seasoning out there;I love this taco seasoning. It is the closest I've been able to get to the taco meat taste of restaurant tacos.
3585;Endorsed by coffee snob;My husband is a coffee snob and usually pooh-poohs Star Bucks.  However, he actually liked this coffee.
3586;sugar free Dubble Bubble review;This product was commonly available in stores but I have not seen it lately.  It's an excellent gum and since it is sugar free, it works to partially clean my teeth too.
3587;bold coffee, great price;My wife wanted to try this because she didn't like the donut shop coffee.  I was also surpriced to find out that this is a great cup of coffee in  the morning and then I use my donut shop for the rest of the day.
3588;Another Product Ruined by Improvement;"I was dismayed to find the ""King Size"" Snickers bars are now two small pieces with an anemic layer of chocolate, and half the flavor of the former King Size Snickers bar.  Always bought the king size"
3589;ideal brown sugar substitute;I am diabetic and have certain recipes calling for brown sugar - so far I have used Ideal in my morning oatmeal and plan on using it  measurements are equal basically. I don't want to resort to using Splenda brown sugar blend because it has some sugar in it.
3590;Best Ever!;This is the best pasta salad I've ever eaten!  I don't like the kinds with mayonnaise and the majority of the mixes call for mayo. Caeser for some reason is hard to find in the stores.
3591;Hard to find and a great price;Sooo happy to have found some ground walnuts. I have a wonderful recipe for a walnut cake that uses only ground walnuts, no flours at all.
3592;AMAZING Chips;I live in and am originally from NJ where Grippos aren't available, I was first introduced to them while living in OH for a few years, and I must say, Grippos bbq potato chips are THE BEST chips I have ever tasted. I like Lays, and all of the other popular chips, but they have nothing on these.
3593;I reviewed this for the smaller package before.;my review there was:<br /><br />This is a very delicious tea and it is offered at a great price for the quality and amount.<br /><br />currently:<br />I have since ordered several of these larger packages, as it is our house tea of choice.
3594;fudge drizzled popcorn;love, love, love it. Very fresh taste of chocolate on every kernal & extremly crunchy.
3595;Delish!;I'm probably one of those weirdos who can tolerate a LOT of heat, so, this review is coming from someone who loves her hot stuff.<br /><br />Anyhoo, this is definitely HOT but not anything near scorching hot where you can't appreciate the flavor of the pepper itself.
3596;brazilian Santos coffee beans;We have been getting Dark Brazilian Santos coffee at our house for several months, maybe a year.  We like that coffee a lot.
3597;Incredible Taste;I've tried many different types of raw honey, and this dandelion honey is incredible. It has a bright yellow appearance and smells and tastes like dandelions, yet it's very sweet and delectable.
3598;Tastes good, zero calories, nice kick of energy.;The popularity of liquid concentrates, to add to water or seltzer, has been a god-send. It allows you to decide how intense a flavor to enjoy and puts that control in the consumer -- a wonderful thing when most beverages are cloyingly sweet or artificial tasting.
3599;GREAT SALT!;Very rich pink color to the salt.  Don't buy over priced salt at the gourmet food stores, the color is faint and they mix in sea salt to save money.
3600;So... rich..;Oh, dear lord..
3601;Great Snack For College Students;Austin Cheese Crackers With Peanut Butter are a delicious, handy, and satisfying snack that I purchase for my husband and me.  My last order I placed was for my college student.
3602;Perfect gift basket for anyone;It's good hot chocolate, but it does taste more sugary than chocolate which is slightly disappointing given this is premium hot chocolate. There is a slight hint of hazelnut, but yeah I think it is marketing to sell sweeter hot chocolate, which is what most of the cheaper hot chocolate companies do.
3603;Great flavor and versatile--and we're vegetarian!;"I absolutely love Lawry's Baja Chipotle Marinade, and use it in a variety of dishes. And, yes, as my title says, we're vegetarian! This product is very versatile and adds great flavor in vegan/vegetarian versions of things, such as these killer fajitas in this blog post, ""My fantastic vegan fajitas"" [."
3604;Good, but leaves smell in microwave for WEEKS!;I originally bought a variety pack of the weight control oatmeal to see what the different flavors were like.  This particular flavor is actually pretty good, but I enjoy the banana bread and cinnamon weight control flavors better.
3605;best organic soba noodles I've yet found;I still am looking for the fabled organic 100% buckwheat soba noodles. But until then, these are what I'll be eating.
3606;Low Cal. Best price ounce per $;Yummy! Stores do not sale cans of this product- (just single serve pouches). You get far more product for your $ buying the can.
3607;old timey goodness;this stuff is terrific!  it's been at least 20 years since i have seen damson plum, jelly or jam, in stores in my area. the taste of AMISH MADE damson plum jam was just as i remember.
3608;Refreshing taste;Hint water is a fantastic way to treat yourself to a refreshing drink with no calories,mans no chemical additives. I carry various essences with me wherever I go.
3609;Did not care for these;We are new to the gluten-free diet and have tried all sorts of goodies.  These, however, were not very good.
3610;Sweet Honey;I purchased Lehua honey from Amazon for a special event.  It arrived on time, was very fresh with just the right amount of thickness.
3611;OK, not great.;These were OK. They taste decent (though nothing like Oatmeal).
3612;OMG delicious;I love honey and this is the very best. smooth and creamy, never pasteurized and need i say delicious.
3613;This stuff works great!;This product is great for replenishing your muscles after a tough work out.  I have also used Cytomax during the course of playing pick up basketball and it really keeps me going.
3614;not exactly what you would expect;I gave this a three star, I guess some cats don't like freeze dried anything. I only purchased this because of the excellent reviews.
3615;Tasty;We've been enjoying this seasoning on our steaks for some time, but this packaging is an great improvement. We first started buying it at a wholesale club where it was sold in a plastic grinder.
3616;Scrumptious!;Sweet Leaf Vanilla Creme Flavored Liquid Stevia is a great addition to smoothies as well as hot and cold coffee drinks. My new favorite is espresso, coconut milk and 5 drops of vanilla stevia.
3617;shipping cost high, product excellent;Received 24 packets of cat food - quantity was unclear in advertising.<br />The packaging protected against damage as if the packets were crystal glassware.
3618;Not a gourmet product;I bought a case of this stuff (Dark Chocolate) based on the positive reviews. Big mistake.
3619;Don't order in July!;The chocolate tasted fresh, but it was a melted mess!  Don't order in warm months.  Probably fine in cooler weather.
3620;Terrible merchant. Not what was ordered.;Before purchasing anything from Lous bonsai, check out the reviews on the Internet, not the ones he writes but the legitimate ones. They're horrible.
3621;has fake sugar;the ginger ale isnt great but its not bad.  its not advertised as diet or whatever but the ginger ale has fake sugar.
3622;Love it!;I had two cans at once.  I love these.
3623;wonderful flavored coffee;I'm a sucker for caramel anything..
3624;Dog loves it;We have a pomeranian who would happily eat table scraps all day long over dog food.  She eats this brand without complaint.
3625;Nice substitute for Diet Coke;I am a Diet Coke addict.  As a result, I'm trying to find an adequate substitute, and for now, sobe lifewater seems to be doing the job for a nice refreshing sweetened beverage with my lunch.
3626;"USED TO BE the perfect balance between ""premium"" and ""affordable"", UNTIL PRICE INCREASE";I'm sad.  I used to be able to purchase a 35 lb bag of this dogfood from Amazon for $39.
3627;Versatile condiment provides big flavor with low calories;If you think horseradish only goes with roasted prime rib you're missing out on some great culinary pairings. Creamy horseradish is a delicious addition to mashed potatoes (and as a topping on baked potatoes), cole slaw, sausages and smoked fish.
3628;not made in England .. it's from Spain  !!;Hi ..
3629;Bland;Strong oil smell is nice, but the flavor is a bit bland. I prefer the Bigelow.
3630;Highly amusing collectible.;We actually found one of these at a bargain store today for $8 and it was worth the money - the batteries are already dying (likely because of kids playing with it in the store) but the sound and lights are true to advertisement - the Death Star lights up and plays the Star Wars theme when opened. It's a big dispenser and pops out the entire pack of pez, not single candies.
3631;Another effective, good product.;I love the mild scent and silky feel of this product.  I have short, dry hair and live in the southern California desert.
3632;Fresh and fulfilling!;Arrived well packaged and fresh looking,with a good enough expiration date. But this box is pricier than I could have bought locally at $6.
3633;Perfect for Small Dogs;Our two dogs love this product, and we love the fact that it's not loaded with chemical preservatives and fillers.  The fact that the pieces are irregular is not a drawback and is not surprising.
3634;Great Treat;Pill pockets make taking his medication a treat instead of a chore. Now we do tricks to get our medication instead of running and hiding.
3635;GREAT FOR MY PURPOSE: CORTISOL CONTROL;"I've been eating 2 TBS per day of these soy lecithin granules as part of a campaign to bring my cortisol levels down. I've not tested outside of the normal ranges for cortisol in medical lab blood work tests, but I've had a small pot belly, blue baggy under-eye circles, and chronic ""tired"" my whole life."
3636;Saw this on Dr. OZ for eliminating crows feet;I watched Dr. OZ on television and he was explaining how to minimize and/or avoid crows feet.
3637;good quality per my research but price... jeez;I'm giving 4 stars to this product because the price is sooo high.<br />But I would say this food is good quality per my research.
3638;Excellent;These bars are awesome. The White Chocolate Macadamia is the only one I've tried, but it's goood.
3639;Delicious!;Great for stashing in your desk drawer at work and eating cheaply. The rice, once heated, is surprisingly fluffy and full of a nice spicy flavor.
3640;My dog loves this food!;I ordered this food because I had been looking for more healthy alternatives than the food that I had been feeding my beloved girl and had purchased a 5 lb bag from my local grocery store. Not only does it receive high marks from various websites that examine the ingredients in different dog foods, but once my dog had tasted this food, there was no going back to what I had been feeding her.
3641;Excellent for Shakes and Smoothies!;My wife and I experimented with these by adding milk, ice cubes, and fruit (bananas, strawberries, blueberries, or other) to our blender.  They make incredible (and healthy) drinks.
3642;Excellent love them more than regular chips.;I love the krinkle sticks. They are better than regular chips.
3643;Love Amazon's subscription process;This is an o.k.
3644;Great for dogs with allergies;We have one dog with bad allergies and cannot have ANY grain relative, or meat.  So it is fish, fruits and veggies only.
3645;Superb;This seasoning has a truly amazing flavor.  I use it to flavor beef brisket prior to slow roasting it.
3646;The Lemon Vanilla Gluten-Free Biscotti are Addicting;I picked up a pack locally and couldn't stop eating them.  The lemon is perfectly complemented by the vanilla.
3647;Great flavor!;This is a bold, assertive tea with flavors that will grab your attention. I love it best as an iced drink, brewed plenty strong.
3648;A dieter's dream!;Anyone on (or ever been on) a diet knows Peanut Butter is a big no-no because of the fat/calories.  This stuff is the perfect answer to all your dreams!  You can mix it with as little/much water as you want so you get the consistency you like and use it on anything!  It basically tastes exactly like peanut butter, just without the sugar - so if it's not sweet enough for you, you can add in a packet of splenda.
3649;Taters ...;I prepare these baked potatoes in a toaster oven. They are the perfect compliment to a hamburger, steak or chicken entree.
3650;The Best Pad Thai on Amazon;I have ordered many different pad thai meals on Amazon and this is by far the best. Great meal to bring to work.
3651;good. buy;Like this coffee, I have.found it for pretty much the same price at GFS ( wholesale store) but like.
3652;Stick with the original...;I love Guayaki's original, but I'm not a huge fan of the chai spice mate.  I bought it, because I love chai and I love mate.
3653;Great taste...very poor packaging;These taste great.  More of a restaurant style chip taste as opposed to a Frito-Lay for the masses taste.
3654;Oh Oh Oh So Good!;I have tried a variety of brands of maple syrups.  This is without a doubt the best!!  I also have never had grade B before as all that is sold around here is grade A.
3655;Black Tiger;"This is one of my all time favorite brands. This is for ""real coffee lovers!""  I like a good strong cup of coffee in the morning and this fits the bill."
3656;Stuff-n liver paste - great stuff!;This stuff is great, my dogs love it and it's very convenient. Easy to squirt in between the ridges of their rubber bones, it keeps them occupied for quite a while.
3657;"Not ""just a cup of tea""";As a life long tea drinker at the age of 65 I think I have tried teas from every corner of the world with every conceivable kind of water, in every conceivable type of container from which to drink.  I can honestly say after discovering Yorkshire Gold two decades ago, I have no other tea in mind when I drink tea.
3658;Rich without being bitter;We have tried several different kinds of K-cups, including Jet Fuel and Wake Up Call.  Black Tiger is by far the best if you're looking for a rich, smooth and bold brew.
3659;The best shake out there!!!;The product arrived right on its scheduled time. This shake is great for pre or post workout.
3660;PRICES GOING UP, UP, UP, DOWN A LITTLE;I really like this soup although I have to lower my 5 star rating to 2 stars.  The last time I paid $15.
3661;Fine product, outstanding service;"I ordered 2 four-oz tubs of the julienne tomatoes and two bags of porcini ""kibbles"".  The tomatoes are really fresh - bright ripe tomato red, flexible (neither hard nor soggy), aromatic, tangy and delicious."
3662;Great plants, fast shipping, easy set up!;Just as promised, packed well, and EASY instructions and fast shipping!<br /><br />We got these after visiting Washington DC Botanical gardens a few weeks ago  They have a great carnivorous plant display now.  So, I came home and dutifully ordered the plants for my boys (ok, they were for me).
3663;Organic Maple Sugar;I have used Coombs Family Farms 100% Maple Sugar for quite a while now an it is so great as a replacement for white sugar. I've used it in cookies and replaced it for the regular sugar in my sweet potato casserole at Thanksgiving.
3664;My dog LOVES them;These are crunchy rather than chewy.  I have to be careful not to give these too often as they seem to cause diarrhea (too much vitamin A?).
3665;The Best Cookie/Wafer Ever!! Just too expensive.;I simply adore this wafer/cookie, but I was really dissapointed in the size and price. I have always bought this at Walgreens.
3666;yum yum;I am enjoying by bones.  My owner would be happier if the shipping wasn't so much.
3667;love the hemp seeds;I am a new convert to the hemp seeds.  They taste delicious raw.
3668;Great;I bought this flavor for the first time at the store, when they were out of my favorite (Sweet N Hot). My kids (ages 4 and 2) were begging me for some when we got back to the car.
3669;very weak hot chocolate;I guess that explains the good deal I got on the price, they probably can't give this stuff away. So suggestions like I've seen out here if you made the mistake I did and bought 48 of these<br />1) always use the 6 or 8 ounce cup top, no 8 - 10 - 12<br />2) add a little suger for flavor, a little cream for texture, and some whipped cream or marshmallows and top off with cinnamin.
3670;Best Deal Yet!;I drink a lot of tea, and over the years I have done my own research. Inevitably, I discovered matcha, its abundant health benefits and its ease of preparation.
3671;Great dog treats;These dog treats are great motivators. At first the price seems high, but they last a long time because only a few need to be used in each training session.
3672;very good;Ordered this in the colder weather and it was great in the morning. Very easy and fast to prepare in K-Cups.
3673;Not Worth Your Money or Time;I bought these on an impulse at the store, thinking they would be amazing. I had tried toasts and crackers similar to this brand (in theory).
3674;Who knows?;Have ordered twice before..
3675;Fanstactic health conscious product;This is a must have for pantry of Pho's fan. Texture and taste of this noodle is authentic to real Pho in Vietnam while is much more healthy.
3676;Yummy!;We were able to try the raisin cookie and it was yummy! Both my kids love rasins and they really enjoyed this cookie. So much healthier then chocolate! Will be buying lots more.
3677;great taste;Eatting allergen free can be a challenge and sometimes boxed items have a gross taste but these outback animals taste pretty good and pretty close to the real ones. These make a quick,easy & tastey snack.
3678;Great snack!;In wondering how to make a yummy snack even yummier, Emerald has answered the question with this product.  The seasonings enhance this already highly-esteemed nut.
3679;Great Tea - Stupid Name;"This is an excellent ""everything but the kitchen sink"" blend.  It's my favorite tea."
3680;Perfect!;My daughter used these when making Hello Kitty cake pops (her bow).  They were perfect for the job, arrived quickly and in great condition.
3681;Think of this not as a puzzle or toy but more of an interactive feeder;I would definitely agree with others that this is not a very challenging puzzle toy.  So why do I give it 5 stars?  Well, challenging or not, this toy keeps my dog engaged and happy while eating!<br /><br />When my husband and I adopted our little dachshund/miniature schnauzer mix, he wasn't eating very much.
3682;My Fave Veg Jerky;"The ""Original Wild"" is a bit spicy for me, but ""Original Mild"" is spectacular, and Teriyaki Beef even better. Also like the spicy chicken one."
3683;The Coffee Cake recipe was amazing!;I am surprised by the other reviews. We found this at our local grocery store and we were pleasantly surprised by the price which was way cheaper than most gluten free foods.
3684;Excellent raw honey with improved packaging;Fresh taste and now improved packaging for this delicious honey. Outstandingly clean and exactly as advertised.
3685;The best chips EVER!;PopChips are the best potato chips I have ever had, hands down.  The BBQ flavor is strong and tangy.
3686;Agave is great!;Agave is a good product and this brand is well priced. If you're unfamiliar with it: it has a very low glycemic index so you don't get a sugar bump or crash.
3687;great deal;Glad to be able to buy cases of vegetables and have it delivered right to my door. Good green beans.
3688;Quite good;Received these in record time. Found the fruit quite fresh and not at all dried out, but perhaps picked slightly too early as the taste is not quite as full as could have been.
3689;It doesn't taste like pineapple;I suppose I may be fussy, but this jam just didn't impress me. It's too sweet and seems to lack the tart 'kick' one expects from eating pineapple.
3690;"Best ""Totally Organic"" Food on the Market";I have been feeding Organix to my 11 year Samoyed for years.<br />He is one of the few older dogs which have not developed any kind of cancer.
3691;"OMG, it was like TT ""totally tasty"" - (in the cat's own words)";IDK where my BFF mom found this delicious snack, but I have to say TY!  Best Feline Friend is dose of rich, ambrosial comfort food.  Mini chunks of tender tuna punctuate the smooth tasty sauce.
3692;finally;i love this stuff and drank it constantly when i lived in TX. it's not available in my part of OK.
3693;Works for my dogs;Been using these dental chews for years for my dogs.  It is best to brush their teeth, but I never get around to that.
3694;good food;if i had the time, i would cook peoplegrade food for my 3 retrievers.  since i don't have that luxury, pinnacle is the next best thing.
3695;Back to Nature - Nantucket Blend;This is no ordinary trail mix!<br /><br />I purchased a 10 oz. bag of this trail mix from my local whole foods market.
3696;Great taste;Gave this a try and really like it. Now all of my family<br />likes it.
3697;Precious rose buds for sachets, teas and decor;These rose buds from Catey13 are precious. They have a soft aroma and a pretty look to them.
3698;Delicious!;We compared this olive oil to the regular olive oil we buy at the grocery - the difference was amazing! This olive oil is fresh and very flavorful.  It is absolutely delicious.
3699;Love This Coffee!;I have tried quite a few of the different brands of coffee put out by Timothy's, Green Mountain and also Dietrich's and I do have to say that this is my favorite so far.  If you like a full bodied, flavorful cup of coffee.
3700;Smells bad!!;The taste is ok at best. The price is good.
3701;not too bad;I am a coffee drinker and have been one for many many years.  For the past couple of years I've been trying to shift to drinking tea.
3702;Excellent Hot Chocholate;Was skeptical about the quality of hot chocolate from a K cup but Grove Square is amazing.  It is just as good as making it from scratch but without the fuss.
3703;Harsh flavor, and yet still  not strong coffee by my standards;I went out on a limb and purchased this 50 pack of Jet Fuel because of so many good reviews.  Let me start by saying, I like STRONG coffee.
3704;One of my favorite flavors;I love this flavor but the packages are smaller than usual. So you can make about 24-32oz with one of the packages.
3705;Not enough info to buy;There really needs to be information on these sorts of products on the amount contained in the jar. Many people like to know how much per ounce they are buying.
3706;Good flavor, but tooooo sweet;The Walnut & Date has a good flavor, but it's way too sweet. My husband has a sweet tooth and he also thinks it's too sweet.
3707;THE BEST COFFEE!!!!!!;if you are a coffee lover - this coffee is for you! Elite taste. Unforgetable flavor.
3708;Great alternative for those who truely need it;First of all, I did read some of the reviews.  I have to say most of you are buying this product for the wrong reasons.
3709;Great tasting coffee;Just got this coffee in the mail today, it arrived early on the estimated delivery date. I am currently drinking a cup and its smooth and goes down easy not really acidic.
3710;Kool-aid is for kids... and adults;This is a great new flavor of Kool-Aid, a non-carbonated drink which I have enjoyed all my life. This particular product contains a little less sugar than the old Kool-Aid but I couldn't taste the difference.
3711;I am not a fan of this.;I love Starbucks.  I love vanilla.
3712;Good Stuff!!!;I don't care for the smell, but it works wonders to guard against breakage.  You notice a difference almost right away.
3713;Great variety means no picky eaters!;"We discovered Earth's Best when my oldest started solids years ago.  They had a more limited selection then, but offered more variety than the ""regular"" brands."
3714;Very nice change.  Tasty.;This coffee is very good. It is a nice change from the other Senseo pods.
3715;Fast shipping and amazing quality;What an amazing deal. These beans are moist and oily and smell amazing.
3716;Tasty very rich soup;I bought this to have on the shelf for a quick meal.  It is very very rich and I suspect would fare better as a cup appetizer before a full meal, and not as a meal.
3717;A family favorite;I buy three different flavors of KIND bars. These are the ones that disappear the soonest so I have had to double up the order.
3718;Extraordinary variety in this sampler!;There are at least 20 different types of coffee in this variety pack. Surprised with the other reviews that complain about lack of variety.
3719;Perfect Japanese style Chilled Noodle/Ramen;I love this noodle - it is perfect chewiness for using in this fashion.  You need to add your own topping though.
3720;Normally a favorite;"I like the food in the whiskas pouches because they look a lot more ""real"" than some other pouches. Usually my cats love this food but lately they haven't been eating it as much."
3721;Cani vitalis breath treats;This is a great product that not only works to whiten teeth and freshen my dog's breath, but she actually begs for them!!  And it's natural and good for her. These are hard to find at the pet store as they have discontinued them, and I have been searching for them for some time.
3722;Cat couldn't get enough;My cat loved this food for a long time. However, he has been picky lately.
3723;good grower delics if you like radish;These seeds grow perfectly in my easy sprouter. 1/4 cup of seeds in 5 days.
3724;If you haven't tried it ...;We used to buy this at DFW airport on our way back from Mexico.  We had not been that way in a long time and my wife asked for it for Xmas.
3725;These are perfect;These teething biscuits are great. Our ten month old loves them.
3726;Best Stevia buy on the internet!;I have purchased the 1000/box several times and have never had a problem.  The product was always received promptly and there have never been any problems with the contents.
3727;Great for itchy pups;I started my dog on this brand after trying several others with no success. He was fed beneful when I adopted him, so I quickly switched to canidae, it helped his itching somewhat, but didnt completely go away, then we tried taste of the wild which gave him the runs and impacted anal glands.
3728;Great spice to use for tagine cooking!;I've used Shawarma for Meat to cook osso buco (cross cut veal shank) and lambs on my tagine.  It comes out great every time!  Along with this spice, I found it necessary to add sea salt and ground pepper to the meat before cooking it on low heat for 1.
3729;Best tea on the market.;This is simply the best tea that I have ever found.  The flavors are incredible when combined with sweetener and half and half.
3730;So yummy and delicious!;This is my husband and I's favorite tea! We were so upset when out local grocer stopped carrying it. I'm so glad that we were able to order it through Amazon.
3731;Warning: Very Highly Addictive;"Like so many others, I had this tea on my first visit to Ireland.<br /><br />After my first cup, I thought, ""this is pretty good!""<br /><br />After my second cup later, I thought, ""this is pretty darn good."
3732;Not bad, but not fabulous;"This is a decent product, and much better than most gluten free mixes available.  However, it has that ""slimy feel"" that a lot of gluten free products have."
3733;Looks good, smells okay but.....;The baby who was lucky enough to be the guinea pig for this food, immediately spit it out.  Not sure if it was the taste or if she was just too young to appreciate the healthy gourmet food.
3734;Absolutely Disgusting;I should have read the reviews before I bought this one. Worse than the hot chocolate at winter camp! Returned it after trying one.
3735;Incredible;I love sensational flavors and these almonds really deliver.<br />They get sprinkled on many of my Thai dishes, stir fries, and fried rice medleys for extra crunch, calcium, fiber, and protein.
3736;little pieces;Although I got them for a great price I won't be ordering this again from Amazon. I got 4 boxes of honey bunches of oats with strawberries but I'm guessing due to so much travel, by the time they got to me, the cereal was in pretty small pieces.
3737;Glad Amazon has this in stock;My wife can't eat wheat products and I was looking for this to have for Thanksgiving. Was happy to find it here and at a good price.
3738;blech;"These aren't clearly labeled ""GLUTEN FREE"". They say pretzel sticks and they do not resemble pretzel sticks very closely at all."
3739;Convenient, economical & very tasty!;"I bought these for the ""in case of earthquake"" food-pantry, but they turned out to be  a favorite with my family. The flavor and texture is excellent."
3740;Light and Tasty!;The Bahlsen Delobas are my favorite so far. Call them biscuits or call them cookies they are just plain good.
3741;Not Freshly Roasted;The description states that this is roasted the day they ship.<br />The first order I placed was 2 months old.
3742;my cats love this!;i could not find the cat version of purebites but it appears to be the same thing only larger pieces?  i add water and mix in slippery elm bark powder (helps with upset stomach) and cosequin.  he laps up every piece/drop.
3743;Great chocolate= great gift!;I was given a box of these as a present. I never heard of them before, but WOW! When you open the box, they almost look like little cigars all wrapped up.
3744;jaybars are good;Tasty and filling. I like it because there is no junk like it says.
3745;I'm Hooked Oh! joy, Oh! Rapture;I learned about this little goodies when a friend at work gave me a couple of them. I've been in bliss ever since that wonderful day.
3746;much cheaper $12.99 at Costco store;my kids love these but I paid $22.24 for 24 bags on Amazon.
3747;Delicious!;I love this candy! and my younger brothers love it too.<br /><br />The candy itself is a smooth, delicious milk chocolate (100 times better than your regular hersheys) and inside is a soft creamy white chocolatey kind of mixture, it almost tastes like malted milk balls, but only slightly.
3748;Mediocre;This cat food is adequate and nothing more. It will feed your cat.
3749;Love It!;The product is excellent and the price for a pack of 50 was outstanding!!!<br />When you drink as much coffee as I do, you need lots of back up! It was shipped in a matter of days and it was in perfect shape. Thank you Amazon.
3750;Real nice coffee!;Just a sweet and enjoyable coffee. Almost a dessert coffee, but I drink it all of the time.
3751;as close to the real thing as you can get!;I purchased a case of Tropico's after seeing them advertised on a gluten free blog. I was skeptical but once I received them (very quickly I might add) I was not disappointed.
3752;Gevalia Dark Choc Ground coffee, decaf;This coffee is fabulous!!!!  It has a great taste for a decaf.  I have to drink decaf now and have a horrible time finding coffees that still have a taste to them when they are decaf.
3753;Sweet treat;For a product without added sugar, this stuff is pretty darn sweet, in more ways than one! I 'cut' mine with soda water, and then it's a bit more on the refreshing side, as opposed to 'I need a sugar rush'. The flavor reminds me of those old 'tutti-fruitti' flavors.
3754;Not too happy thus far...;Shipping: Ordered on a Sunday of Week 1.  Placed in box on a Friday of Week 2.
3755;great sticks!;The quality of these cinnamon sticks is very good.  They meet my requirements well.
3756;Not one of my Favorites;I don't know, people seem to like this k-cup, but it just did not do it for me.  Maybe I got a bad batch, as it was simply overpowering for me.
3757;ice breaker stick gum love it but costluy;I love this gum. But I have been trying other gum to find a comperable product.
3758;Ginger good for sore throats...not much in the way of Lemon...;I don't have a cold right now but since I often take ginger and honey for a sore throat, I thought this might be a nice alternative.<br /><br />It might be, in a pinch.
3759;Takes a little work;this gum paste is a good product- like my fondant, I had to warm it to really work with it, but it got hard too fast and I couldn't work with it as well. but I'll keep trying.
3760;Great Convenience- watch dosage;This is a great product but I highly recommend using 1/2 vial then waiting an hour or two to consume the second half.  Now I'm only 136 lbs so for a larger person it may not be an issue.
3761;Tasty;I was told about this stuff at a party and, as a lover of Mayonnaise, thought I'd buy some. I don't use it a lot, but it's pretty good on fries.
3762;Great treats;Any edible bone can cause a dog to choke, but Greenies changed their formula about a year ago to make it more digestible.  I love the product.
3763;Great Everday Stong Coffee;I enjoy this flavor of coffee everyday at work.  This was the alternative I chose to Dark Magic, which is also a good brew.
3764;Blazing hot, very tasty;One of the hottest sauces I have ever had and, unlike many, tastes strongly of peppers, not of vinegar.  Exactly what I look for in a hot sauce.
3765;Very nice hot cocoa;This is a great hot cocoa - dissolves quickly and fully - great flavor, very rich and creamy even with just hot water. Far better than the typical hot cocoa.
3766;I love em;If you are looking for a snack for when you watch tv that won't make you grow out of your clothes look no further.  These yummy treats are full of protein and fiber.
3767;So delicious with the perfect amount of chocolate;These choco peanut butter bars are delicious and perfectly filling.  I got these to eat for breakfast and as an occasional snack.
3768;I was addicted to this stuff for a while, but wore myself out;It's high-quality and the price is right, especially with subscribe-and-save via Prime, but after months of trying to keep up with my subscription, I had to put it on hold.  I'm not a big water drinker, but this stuff has a distinct flavor and when you're using it as a work-out beverage four or five times a weak it eventually wears on you.
3769;Green*Chai*Tea= Heaven*in*my*Mouth;It is so delicious.  It tastes just like chai but has the benefits of green tea.
3770;Great stuff!;Love this stuff!  Very sweet, natural, no calories, carbs, etc.  I add it to smoothies, mainly.
3771;Coca Tea  Great product;I have been ordering various products from this seller for close to a year now. These products have helped me with weight loss and anti-depression, as I am a former combat veteran who deals with PTSD.
3772;Pleasant enough;My husband and I both tried Izze All Natural Sparkling Pomegranate Juice and here's what we think:<br /><br />First Impressions..
3773;Formula Changed;The Newman's Own Organics 2nd Generation Turkey & Vegetable has changed the ingredients from Turkey Liver to Pultry Liver.<br />This is not good if your cat is allergic to Chicken as ours is.
3774;Who needs $10 popcorn at the Theater;All you need is coconut oil, Flavacol and some buttery topping and you have Movie Theater Popcorn..
3775;Jolly Time popcorn;My Dad loves this popcorn and the store he was getting it at closed and he couldn't find it anwhere else.  He was happy that I was able to find it online.
3776;horrible - I'll stick with Swanson's;This has a metallic edge to it and always ruins whatever concoction I use it in.  I forgot about it and used one of these vile vials that were gathering dust.
3777;Exactly as advertised;The vanilla beans arrived promptly, exactly as advertised.  I am now making my own vanilla extract.
3778;Naturally nasty;I don't care if they're natural and not fried. The taste is odd and the texture is like packing material.
3779;Eclairs ROCK;I discovered Cadbury Eclairs a few years ago while visiting my daughter in England.  I thought I had died and gone to heaven!!  I usually bring back bags of them from England, but I'm thrilled to find I can get them from Amazon!  Whooppeeeeeee!  Try 'em, you'll LOVE 'em.
3780;Soft and Chewy;This individually wrapped cookie was moist, soft and chewy. The taste was perfect and it was beyond expectations, the perfect bite.
3781;Nice twist on an old favorite;I really like Emerald's packaging for their nuts -- it fits nicely in your hand. All the easier to indulge in over-eating! It's nice to throw in my daughter's backpack for a snack on the go.
3782;Great taste, tender meat;This is great jerky.  The meat is tender and not overly-dried.
3783;I hate kidney beans;I hate kidney beans.  Always have.
3784;Yummy!;These are delicious.  They are very light and can almost melt in your mouth.
3785;Great, fresh product, great value, delivered fast;I drink a lot of coffee. I've purchased beans from lots of sources.
3786;My dogs love these;I have five dogs and feed these daily to help keep their teeth clean.  My only complaint is that they are quite expensive to feed on a daily basis.
3787;Love the tea!;I love this tea.  I like a more expensive one than this one but the Yunnan Pu Erh tea is a great substitute.
3788;Great Garbanzos;Upon receiving the product, I started a batch soaking to get them ready to cook. I soaked the beans overnight and cooked them up in the pressure cooker (after watching Good Eats episode on garbanzos/chickpeas).
3789;gin & tonic;first had Q Tonic Water in California several years ago for a gin and tonic. The drink was fresher tasting, more flavorful.
3790;The Best On The Market;The Best On The Market<br /><br />I was looking for a several good Ice cube Tray ,  in order to freeze what i need for making Excellent Iced Coffee In Granita Style !<br /><br />I have search and search on amazon and there are so many..
3791;Loved these cookies!;"We ordered these cookies for a ""Down on the farm"" birthday party and they were a huge hit! The children loved them. They were shipped promptly and arived without one broken cookie."
3792;Not what I expected!;The bonsai in the photo is nothing like what I received.  I received a little tiny thing that is only 2 inches tall and isn't growing out to the side at all.
3793;K-cup variety pack is a great sampler;So you take the plunge and buy yourself a coffee pot that takes K-cups but you are not sure what flavor to buy. Do yourself a favor and get this variety pack to experience different coffee flavors.
3794;Hard to Find;I am partial to dishes that combine meat with fruit. In my recipe collection are  a couple of delicious recipes using canned plums as a base.
3795;Delicious & Adorable;This flavor is true to its name. They have a good gingerbread taste that is neither too strong nor sweet.
3796;Delicious;This is very quick and easy to make and there is never really ever just one way of preparting vermicelli or anything else for that matter.<br /><br />A brown rice version is slightly healthier and great for those of us whose staple consists of rice.
3797;Remember Nut & Honey Crunch O's? They're Back... Almost.;I assumed that this would be the Kelloggs version of Honey Nut Cheerios, but actually it isn't.  Instead it tastes like Kelloggs famous cereal from the late 80's - Nut & Honey Crunch.
3798;The Best;OMG I can not get over how great this Coconut Oil is! I use it to moisturize my hair & my hair loves it. My hair is in good health because of this product.
3799;Crunchy addition to baked recipes;I bought this out of the desire to make gluten free and primal baked recipes, and to be able to add crunch to salads, dressings, and my baked goods.  These fit the bill perfectly.
3800;Wrong quantity listed not 1/2 lb actually 1/4 lb (120 gm);I buy this tea often (it is very good) and am aware of three quantities it is sold in: 120 gm (0.25 lb), 227 gm (0.
3801;Nice aroma, perfect grind, bland and bitter flavor;I usually enjoy a cup of coffee a few days a week, more as an indulgence than as a necessity.  It's a sipping beverage for me, and flavor matters a lot.
3802;Strong, not much depth;This is a good strong black tea, although it does not have the complicated aftertaste you get from some other brands of Assam tea.  A good hearty breakfast tea.
3803;A real hit with my impossible cat;Petite Cuisine Gourmet Cat Food was a real hit with my impossible cat.  My cat refuses almost all canned cat food so I was completely shocked when she showed an interest in this food.
3804;great little treat;These treats are made from high quality ingredients, and are made in the U.S.
3805;Nasty Pill Time Replaced by Special Treat Time!;My dog was once good about taking pills with a bit of peanut butter.  Now that he's on more meds, I've had to up the ante to get him to take the pills.
3806;Good product,  better sevice;So I wanted to get a few of these for backpacking.  Small size,  light weight and if it breaks not much damage done.
3807;ick, ew, yuck, gross;wow-threw this away after one bite.  chemical, sticky sweet smell.
3808;"OK in a pinch, but otherwise, ""meh"".";"My wife is a big fan of Starbucks' Pumpkin Spice Latte, so when I saw this item crop up, I got her one, thinking it might be something that could satiate her cravings for the Starbucks cup of the same flavor.<br /><br />The report back from her was ""it's a good thing you got that from Amazon Vine, and didn't pay for it, because if you did, I would have said you wasted your money."
3809;Not worth it;Not very good. Powdery tea, little taste, little smell.
3810;Muir Glen products are best in my book;Short of being able to buy the product in glass jars (or make it myself) this is about the most perfect prepared tomato taste.<br /><br />I'd heard a rumor that they were going to be bought out by a large corporate concern
3811;very good;Kona coffee is hard to find around our area, so I was so happy to find this. It was beautifully packaged and I was able to taste the product also and it was very good.
3812;Ok, but expensive;It's the standard Horizon milk, in small packages that you don't have to refrigerate.<br /><br />The only reason I buy this is I bake, and I hate being halfway through a recipe and discovering I'm out of milk.
3813;I love Chai tea;This is very good and makes the house smell wonderful.  I would defintely recommend this to anyone just wanting a quick tea.
3814;Great for metabolism and energy;I take one every morning with breakfast. I get a little energy burst without that jittery feeling from too much caffeine.
3815;True Lemon crystallized lemon packets;Have been using these for a while now.  They're ideal in lieu of a fresh lemon to make water more interesting, or to sprinkle on fish.
3816;Not What Expected....;I ordered this coffee under the impression that it was a medium roast,that was according to the brief description & by zooming in the box on my laptop. On the the side of the box it stated medium.
3817;Delicious flour!;I have made multiple loaves of bread so far with this whole wheat bread flour.  I still have a lot of flour left to use, but I'm sure it will go quickly.
3818;Perfect!;These were great for my daughter's kite party.  I put them on the top of the cupcakes and used liquorish whips as strings.
3819;YUCK!;When I selected this dip, it is because I missed the savory flavor of onion dip..
3820;Tasty;I have to say, I really like this chip.<br /><br />It's a bit thinner than the flaxseed tortilla chips I normally buy at Trader Joe's, and the flavor is nuttier.
3821;Great Product - tasty/good texture GF bread;I have used this in the small size bags, with yeast included, in the bread machine.  Found it got rather expensive.
3822;Product is wonderful, cheaper at 7-11, amazon overcharges;I love this product, one of the better tasting diet products. However amazon overcharges for them.
3823;Used to be the only way I could get veggies down my baby!;Before trying these pouches, I would attempt to hide veggies in my daughter's baby cereal and fruit puree.  I could put the tiniest bit in her bowl and she would always detect it.
3824;Very nice Christmas chocolates, but they slip;Beautiful front graphic Christmas scene (nondenominational) with easy enough windows for my 5 y/o to open daily.  The chocolates must be good because my daughter had one every day.
3825;Sugar in the Raw;Very good product.  Has a much more appealing taste than regular table sugar, which by the way, is bleached.
3826;What???;Ok..
3827;Quick, easy and cheap K-Cups;The DisposaKups work as advertised.  They are easy to use, just put your favorite coffee in the cup, pop the cap on and brew.
3828;Cheese with a kick;Exactly what I was looking for.  I was served a piece of Horseradish Havarti on a recent trip.
3829;yuck;I have tried and tried, second box of this stuff and its just not good coffee. Wish I had purchased a Keurig just for the variety.
3830;Wish I would've found it sooner!;I began using this at my last job and completely fell in love with it. Being younger and new to the culinary industry, I was completely amazed that someone had solved the I-can't-believe-I'm-out-of-vanilla-beans problem.
3831;Possibly the best small dog food;I've got a small poodle-mix. I've tried almost every premium food for my dog.
3832;Not as bad as naysayers make them sound;These are NOT replacement noodles, let me just say that first and foremost. Not that great as an Italian pasta substitute.
3833;Good Coffee but not the best;It is a good coffee with a good aroma. Good for espresso.
3834;Can't live without it!;I used to purchase this at the world market by my home but the store has recently closed down. I'm so glad I found it here on Amazon even with the steep shipping price its still worth it.
3835;unhealthy treats;My dogs loved this product.  Unfortunately I will never order it again because the ingredients are  so unhealthy.
3836;great;We will keep these on hand 'always' - best mint candy around by far. (Wouldn't it be great if they were from the U.
3837;Cherry Juice (Indian);My son and I have both been taking tart cherry juice for about 2 months.  His gout is better and my back and sleeping are better also.
3838;Pretty much what you'd expect it to taste like;I've tried all of the Mocktails now and this is my second favorite after the Mojito.  The taste of this is basically like a margarita tastes, only a little more watered down and minus the salt.
3839;Pacific Natural Foods - Roasted Red Pepper & Tomato Soup;Would be an excellent product however the light sodium loses it's taste. You'll need to put Sea Salt of something else in order to enhance  the flavor.
3840;A pleasant, hot, nourishing substitute for coffee;Pinole is a powdery blend of toasted ground corn, sugar and cinnamon.  There is not too much sugar in the El Guapo mix as one reviewer claimed.
3841;Very versatile;For the most part, I'll just echo what previous reviewers have said. This stuff is wonderful for putting you to sleep fast, as well as helping with anything to do with muscle relaxation.
3842;Utter Crap, Not same as store, low quality;Product not what is in stores, low quality. Taste and quality varies greatly between items in package.
3843;Perfect for the caffine sensitive;I have tried pills, (Stacker, Hydoxicut, etc). I tried the drinks, (Rock Star, Amp, coffee,etc).
3844;Complete garbage;Bought this trap at my local Menards hardware store.  Seemed ok at first.
3845;Our new go-to basmati!;We just love this rice at our house. Perfect.
3846;Weight Loss Benefits of Green Tea!;Weight Loss Benefits of Green Tea<br />=================================<br /><br />If you drink green tea you can-<br />* Lower Cholesterol<br />* Increase Thermogenesis (the body's rate of burning calories)<br />* Enhance fat oxidation<br /><br />Burns Fat Naturally<br />Green tea contains high concentrations of catechin polyphenols. These compounds work with other chemicals to intensify levels of fat oxidation and thermogenesis, where heat is created in the body by burning fuels such as fat.
3847;Quart bottle of sorgham;I am disappointed with the sorgham from Barry Farms! It has very little sorgham flavor to it. In fact, my daughter said that it tastes more like syrup that you would buy at the grocery store and I tend to agree.
3848;Very good!;I love these! They are so cheap, but so tasty! My husband thinks they are way too sweet, but I love them! They don't have a huge coffe flavor, so they are a bit sweeter than an actual cappuccino. Regardless, they are very tasty and at this price, who can complain? Their hot chocolate is pretty good too.
3849;Lindt lindor truffles milk chocolate;The Lindt Lindor Truffles Milk Chocolate are the best. They are creamy in the middle with a harder outer shell.
3850;Green Mountain Extra Bold Dark Magic...;"is a perfect match for the Keurig Brewer because Green Mountain invented the Keurig Brewer.  The Extra Bold coffee is truly a deep but smooth coffee that's just right for that first ""cup-a-joe"" in the morning."
3851;Great for KIDS!;It can be difficult to find really healthy drinks that kids will love.  I tested this tea on my nephew and it was a success!!  Not only did I get him away from soda but he's being healthy.
3852;Love them;My dog loves these. I also bought them way cheaper than the pet store.
3853;LOVE them!;I am an ingredient freak. I love that this cereal has no high fructose corn syrup or partially hydrogenated oils.
3854;Delicious jerky;This is probably the best mass-produced beef jerky on the market.  It isn't too tough or dry like cheaper brands, isn't too sweet or spicy either.
3855;3 of 5 cans of formula arrived ruined;Three out of five cans of formula arrived at my home completely dented and leaking powdered formula.  The packaging was completely inadequate.
3856;Really good - little powdery but good;These taste wonderful.  They are a little powdery, which is to be expected since they are freeze dried, so don't breathe in as you're eating.
3857;Dang, they changed the flavor;I just received my third auto-shipment because I luv this stuff, noticed the box and packets are now with a white background instead of white and light green, but ingredient list was the same..
3858;Save your body and your money;Organic brown rice is expensive and hard to cook with. This brand makes it much easier, cheaper and if you cook it with organic veggie broth, it's even better! The texture is better than you average organic brown rice, and the taste is better overall.
3859;Very stale;Like almost every other food product I've purchased through Amazon, these are extremely stale. They are also very small for granola bars, which might be what you want if you're buying them for kids.
3860;Love this;I have enjoyed this rice and have reordered it. It is about as easy a brown rice as you can cook.
3861;Really good!;This is a delicious and satisfying noodle bowl.  They give you packets of oil and seasonings so that you can flavor it to your own taste.
3862;Karo Pancake Syrup;I really like this syrup and have used it for many years. It has become impossible to find in local grocery stores and I really appreciate being able to get it here.
3863;Hardly any salt on pretzels.;I like the pretzels, but there is hardly any salt on the pretzels. I've eaten several boxes with the same result.
3864;Pretty good;These are pretty decent and don't taste like cardboard. They make good S'mores too.
3865;Great Taste & Great Deal!;I wait all year for the Pumpkin Spice K-Cups to arrive. I am very glad that Amazon offers such a large quantity so cheap! 50 count sounds like a lot, but if you love Pumpkin Spice then you will find them disappearing quite fast! The taste is great, my favorite is Starbucks Pumpkin Spice Lattes from their coffee houses, but this is my second favorite drink ever! Pair it with some pumpkin spice creamer found at your local grocery store and you have a delicious drink! I don't care for these without creamer, but I love sugar so.
3866;Perfect for kids on the run;Great price, fast delivery. Thank you.
3867;A tough, satisfying chew;"The 12"" size takes my 5 month lab up to a week to work through. She did just get all of her permanent teeth in, so maybe that time will speed up given some months."
3868;Not my cup of tea;I tried to find out the ingredient list before I purchased this seasoning. I went to Paul's website and it didn't list the ingredients.
3869;Zuke's Peanut Butter Treats;My dogs love the Zuke's treats especially the Salmon and Peanut Butter.  They work great for training purposes.
3870;Pros & Cons;On a positive note, Green Mountain Hot Cocoa is one of the few (hot cocoa) products that is not made with hydrogenated oils.  I, like some other reviewers, had a problem with it clumping in some (not all) of the k-cups.
3871;Yum! Choc. Chip Cookie;I like Pamela cookies. You can't beat the price, better than any store around here.
3872;Worthwhile treats;At first sniff the two girls turned up their noses at the new snack. To be fair, this happens with the introduction of most new snacks to this fussy and suspicious pair.
3873;Baronet Coffee Pods - Hazelnut;I ordered the Baronet Coffee Pods for my Senseo Coffee Maker.  The pods fit rather tightly in the machine, almost feels as if the lever is going to break trying to close over the pod.
3874;10 thumbs way up!;Every one of my children love these toaster pastries..
3875;Nice and strong;Nice to have found a decaf coffee with a strong flavor. I make my coffee using the smallest cup setting on my Keurig.
3876;Best coconut milk out there;I have tried many brands of coconut milk and this is by far the best.  At least 1/2 the can is the thick coconut paste prized in so many recipes.
3877;Good Concept;I bought this product (Beef Flavor) to be able to maybe give my dog her medicine more easily, but she won't eat them.  She puts it in her mouth, but then spits it right back out, licks it a little, then leaves it alone.
3878;Normally don't drink Dark Roast...;This blend isn't too harsh though.  Admittedly I use creamer with all my coffee
3879;Almond Coffee Syrup;Torani almond flavor syrup was exactly what I was looking for. I also purchased a pump to dispense the syrup into my morning coffee.
3880;cocoa;great purchase.  I live alone, and am the only one drinking this.
3881;Tasty and Gluten Free;These are the best snack bar that I have found since going gluten free.  I particularly like the chewiness of the dates with the crunch of the Cashews.
3882;Great product, excellent price, quick shipping;I've used Calm in the past and I know what it can do. It helps me sleep better and relax.
3883;Yummy;Really tasty little cookies.  The bad thing about these yummy treats is that the bag should've been bigger.
3884;Wholesome;My one year old loves lentils, so I was happy when I found a good sized portion of GMO Free lentils. They cooked well and tasted delicious.
3885;Contains sucrose;Just be forewarned, this product contains sucrose. I didn't realize this and so had to end up throwing it away after I received it.
3886;Suprised Husband;I bought this tuna for a lot of reasons - something susatinable, lower mercury, no bpa, etc, etc.<br />Mixed it up as I usually do for tuna sandwiches, but didn't have time to make them, so sent the mix to works with my husband for lunch.
3887;Slim Jims have nothing on X-Sticks;I selected these Slim Jim sticks to try because the Jack Links X-Sticks Bacon Cheddar flavor I usually buy was out of stock. The Slim Jims have a good flavor, but they are far more greasy, and their casing is tough, like eating wax paper.
3888;A Pleasing Healthy Food;I just received this in the mail and I am pleased with the taste and nutritional value.  I will most likely be eating these in the morning in order to start my day.
3889;Weak Vanilla Flavor;After researching brands of vanilla bean paste, I decided to go with this one as it consistently has the best reviews. However, I'm not happy with this product at all.
3890;Very Hot Cayenne Pepper;If you are looking for cayenne pepper that really packs a punch, this is it.  I have been taking cayenne to try and improve blood circulation to my hands and feet.
3891;Perfect;I am a huge fan of these things. A little fizz makes the extra refreshing on my long bike rides.
3892;Popcorn has never tasted so good!;I needed a new popcorn popping pan which I purchased from Amazon just before Christmas. In the add it mentioned trying Coconut oil for popping popcorn.
3893;One weird idea;Can you imagine how this product came to fruition?  It seems like an accident.  Like the guys in R&D accidentally filled some roll-on deodorant tubes with dog food flavoring.
3894;Very healthy!;I had been drinking green tea because I'd read it was very good for you. It took me a while to acquire a taste for it but eventually I came to really like it & drink it throughout the day at work.
3895;If only it was healthy;I don't have a Trader Joe's near me so when I went for the first time, this was something I grabbed for just to try. It's REALLY good but it is definitely not as healthy as a regular nut butter.
3896;Cat Loves!!!;I have an older cat and she consistently loves all the flavors in here. I originally bought it as a sampler but she just loves all of them so much that I just keep getting the variety pack.
3897;Love this stuff!!;We use this in place of sugar for almost everything.  It has a light flavor, sort of similar to honey without the crystallization and the strong flavor.
3898;Easy delicious dips;There is nothing better than having a dip or two when you have people over.<br />what's great about these dips is they can be made so easily, there is a good variety and the best is that they taste so good.
3899;How sweet;How sweet it is. And it's value priced.
3900;Does what it claims;I had to stop giving my  15 year old cat dry food because he could no longer hold it down (even the ones with only whole food ingredients were too hard on his system).  He would even throw up blood clots if I had to leave him with dry food for a couple of days.
3901;NOT AN ASSORTMENT;12 out of 24 units is not an assortment.  Decaf is not coffee, and flavored hot drinks are no<br />excuse for not including coffee in the varities dispensed.
3902;Wonderful;This was a great treat. I got it as a gift for family with two young labs and it was so interesting for all of us to see how interested they were.
3903;Love this stuff!;Just love the taste and tartness of these. They are not too sweet, have a little fizz to them, quench your thirst after a hard days work.
3904;Great Chicken;This chicken is amazing. I cooked it at about 340* for 20 minutes and it came out perfect.
3905;Fantastic tea;I LOVE this tea..
3906;wonderful!;"While in Thailand for 3 weeks many years ago I discovered ""ginger tea"" which was (to me) a tasty and warming beverage that calmed my stomach. It took a long time to find an equivalent drink once I got back, but this seems to be the same thing."
3907;Premium Olive Oil;I use olive oil every day. I have three different types in my kitchen and Macia El Altet has my overall top personal rating because it just makes most of the dishes I cook explode with flavors that will dance in a balanced coordination in your palate.
3908;The coldn't care less!;For something that was supposed to attract them, The flys couldn't have cared less. In about a months time it caught maybe 10 flies which sure were only a miniscule fraction of those in the kitchen! Was a waste of money.
3909;Very good;I am not a fan of brown sugar, but decided to give this a try.  I was pleasantly surprised.
3910;Good Popcorn and flavor but not a premium pop;This popcorn is good but has lots of the shell. it is NOT the premium popcorn you get when you buy a quality kernel.
3911;Pleasant;This is very pleasant, smooth coffee flavor with a hint of vanilla.  Not bitter.
3912;it's quite good;This tea is probably as good as it gets with teabags. I drink it when traveling or under similar circumstances when brewing loose tea is not practical.
3913;Gloria Jeans Butter Toffee k-cups;The price is certainly right on this coffee through Amazon, esp. if you sign up for auto delivery.
3914;Great Product Great Price;I have searched stores and online places for the best price on Earth's best Formula.  This is the best price and free, fast shipping.
3915;The Real Thing;This is what Gulden's wishes it were, if it didn't have to be dumbed-down and blandified for the masses.<br /><br />Mister Mustard is hot, vinegary, and hits you in the nose.
3916;Leggo my Mango!;After seeing some of the glowing reviews for this matcha, I had to try it. Trying Mango Diablo from DavidsTea recently has brought back to mind my love of mangos and real mango flavor.
3917;ONLY if you LOVE STRONG COFFEE!!;This coffee drink is so strong that it dried up all the spit in my mouth for a week.  Not really, but you get the idea.
3918;Happy to find a childhood favorite!;The Raisins & Spice flavor of Quaker Instant Oatmeal was a favorite of mine as a child, and I have not been able to find it at my local grocery stores. I was very happy to find it at Amazon.
3919;Flax seeds are so good for you...;Great price and good quality flax seeds, will buy again. They last a long time bought this way.
3920;Pop Chips are awesome;Taste is similar to regular potato chips but without the guilt of eating something so bad for you.  They make a great snack.
3921;Great quality quinoa;Good quality quinoa that has already been washed thoroughly to remove all the saponin, so that it isn't bitter when cooked. The 4 bags come in a nice little box that can be used as a storage tray in your kitchen cabinet.
3922;Moisturizing without leaving residue or weighing down;This conditioner really surprised me. I have thin hair plus I feel like I'm losing a lot of it, so anything that weighs my hair down makes it look even more sparse.
3923;disappointed;Disappointing in the amount of meat and vegetables. Guess I was hoping for a more natural sauce.
3924;With a dash of Dirt;Sorry, McCormick, but it took me a month, eliminating spices and ingredients one at a time from my spaghetti sauce to determine the dirt is in your oregano.<br /><br />Reminds me too too much of lunch at the beach .
3925;Excellent taste...you won't believe it is sugar free;It took me awhile to find this product. I found the regular sugar free, but the reviews were fairly negative on taste compared to the product with sugar.
3926;Excellent Product Especially for Large Dogs;What better way to provide your dog with the potential benefits of Glucosamine?  Although the benefits for animals, such as dogs (and the jury is still out on humans too), are still argued, there are no drawbacks to providing your dog with Glucosamine.  If your dog loves peanut butter, then he or she will love these biscuits.
3927;GREAT GRAIN FREE OPTION;After MUCH research and two complete urinary tract blockages we discovered that our cat SHOULD NOT be eating grain. Grains such as rice, wheat, corn and gluten are present in a large majority of pet foods available on the market.
3928;Good tasting bar;The taste is one of the better tasting Larabars I've had. It has a slight sour taste because of the dried fruit pieces, but it's less noticeable then some of the others.
3929;Very special treats;Boy our dogs go crazy for these treats, I buy the regular sized ones and cut them into thirds, they are easy to cut and our dogs are small Yorkies so the third portion is perfect for a treat. They are good for their teeth too.
3930;Dogs love these.;My 2 poodles just love this product. And they are good for them.
3931;Very good cereal;The product is very good and a good deal when one can get the free shipping. That is cheaper than driving to the store and purchasing it.
3932;Not very good soda;If you expect this to taste like dr peppeper you will be very disappointed like I was. Sad to say but this product really needs a taste review before they offer it to the public.
3933;Terrrrific!!;Simply Awesome. I love bold coffee and love French Roast Brews.
3934;new edition available of this oldie but goodie;"this is a great cookbook, but the new edition was printed in 1998, and that one is probably better for today's 'waves.<a href=""http://www."
3935;Warning! Contains ASPERTAME...;"I thought I had read the info carefully enough prior to purchase, but I hadn't.  I am HIGHLY allergic to ASPERTAME and while this is NOT listed as a ""diet"" soda, obviously it is or someone somewhere does not understand that aspertame contains quite a number of neurotoxins that are not healthy for the human body to ingest."
3936;"OK for ""All Natural"" but falls short of richer mixes";Last night, our house was filled with the delicious scent of chocolate as my wife baked batches of Naturally Nora Doubly Fudgy Brownies to give away as Christmas gifts. The mouth-watering aroma was a pleasant accompaniment to the Christmas tree and music.
3937;Best dog food ever;I have a Cavalier King Charles Spaniel and he has been on Wellness Core for about 4 weeks.  His coat has never looked or felt better.
3938;K-Cup coffee;This is the first coffee I have used in my new Keurig. The coffee tastes great and being able to brew one cup at a time,the coffee is always fresh.
3939;Cloves?  Really?  Where?;I bought this along with several other Roland tinned teas.  This was at the bottom of the heap in terms of taste.
3940;Orange Milano Memories;A tasty treat for those who remember what these were like when they used to sell them in the stores, now I can't find this one, but they have the double chocolate, mint, and other random flavors that I don't find quite as appealing.<br /><br />Note that this is a pack of four, but still expensive for such - probably designed to extract the emotional value from people like me.
3941;A bakers dream come true.;This blend is really roasty. Since I am not a coffee drinker, I was less than thrilled with my purchase.
3942;Dissapointed;I have to say that I read the reviews and thought that it might be an alright basket. Let me tell you after ordering another at the same price and looking at the quality of the product I am pretty disappointed.
3943;Very Natural Tasting - Highly Recommended;"These David's Signature Beyond Gourmet ""Vanilla Bean"" jelly beans have a very natural vanilla flavor and are one of my favorites. These are also excellent when paired with <a href=""http://www."
3944;So Happy I found this;
3945;Not good at all!;I have been on an Indian food kick lately. The local Indian restaurant is quite expensive so I decided to try this sauce as a cheaper option.
3946;milka candy;We have been enjoying this chocolate for years. It comes from Germany when family goes to visit family.
3947;A beautiful oil;I bought this oil as a part of a Christmas present for my father. I had been looking for a vinegar sampler, and came up empty.
3948;soothing;Maybe this is a placebo effect however, since I have been drinking this tea, sometimes in the morning and some times at night, I have felt more calm and my mood is somewhat lifted. The taste is fine- I sometimes add a little honey but it is fine as is.
3949;Better than I expected;I had the regular Golazo and liked it but I thought I'd try the sugar free version. This is a good choice for those looking to cut out sugar.
3950;No more powder residue;Mio Liquid is a water enhancer.  I've tried many water enhancers and some I like and some I don't.
3951;smithinsight;Since my friend referred me to the Blue Buffalo Dry Dog Food, it is the only product I will buy for my special dog. Remember we choose our pets, they don't choose us! We buy the best for ourself so why not for our pet companion(s)! My dog also loves the Blue Buffalo Dog Treats.
3952;Paul Newman saved my dog!;Prior to switching to Newman's Own Organics Dog food, my 4 year old shih-tzu was crunching on Iams. Which was fine, except that every 2-3 months or so he'd have stomach problems.
3953;crunchy!;The labels screams not to over cook, but I've cooked it several times, exceeding the max cooking time by 1-3 minutes, and it's still crunchy in the middle.  Tastes great, though!  Looks like I'm the only one with this problem, and no, I am not at a high altitude.
3954;Great product!;We love this product and have used it for years. Was excited to find it online in large quantity.
3955;Light is an understatement -- NO flavor is more like it;Okay, so I like a strong cup of coffee.  I tried the Senseo Dark Roast and it was very good -- bold, but smooth taste.
3956;Too expensive.;I can get this locally, but sometimes they are out of stock.  I took a peek here to see if I could get a good supply cheaply.
3957;Really, the best coffee I have ever had;I was living in Wyoming and the new coffee shop moved in to town,<br />and were serving Raven's Brew coffee.  I LOVED their roasts, and in<br />a couple of weeks had moved to Ketchikan, Alaska where it originated.
3958;Bold But Not Extra Bold.  Smooth, Flavorful & Not Bitter..;Tully's House Blend falls squarely into the Bold category, but it is definitely not an Extra Bold coffee.  It is smooth, flavorful and does not have a bitter aftertaste.
3959;Great taste - need bigger bags;These are very crunchy and tasty. I have truly enjoyed munching on them.
3960;NOT chocolate, folks;"The people saying, ""these are the best chocolate truffles I've ever tasted"" have obviously never tasted a real chocolate truffle.  These things, while they'll satisfy a sweet tooth, are NOT chocolate."
3961;Excellent;We have been using this to make cinnamon popcorn.  The Pure Cinnamon Oil 4 oz.
3962;Really Good Chewing Gum - Highly Recommended!;Eclipse Breeze Exotic Mint chewing gum is, by far, the best breath freshening sugar free gum I have tried. Unlike other gums where you need multiple pieces to get any noticeable effects, one piece of this gum is enough to leave your mouth feeling cool and clean.
3963;Chiclets gum;A memory from when I was a little girl.  I still like this product and it is the same as I remember it.
3964;Not what they say.;I ordered the Hibiscus tea because it is said to be good for high blood pressure.<br />It did not state that there were spices in this tea.
3965;Great blend of flavor.;There's not much I can say that hasn't already been said. But when I brewed this coffee I really wasn't expecting to like it at all, seeing as I don't normally like coconut flavored things.
3966;Chunky Peach......Delish!;I first purchased this product at a farm market in Michigan in July and had to have more.  Thanks Amazon.
3967;I like the taste;For me the tea has light taste, I drink it once a day for about 2 months, hoping to have better hair and nails (after seeing it on Dr.Oz).
3968;Quick, easy, and tasty;Having a gluten-free replacement for Quaker instant oatmeal makes my mornings easier. My kids and I need a quick breakfast so we can get to work and school on time.
3969;I love this. Great for more than dipping.;Yes, it's great mixed into olive oil for dipping fresh bread into, but that's not all it's used for at my house.  I mix it with oil and vinegar for my own vinaigrette salad dressing.
3970;Love this blend!;Strange how I couldn't order this blend from Green Mountain Coffee - They've been out of stock for ages now. So happy to see that it was offered here! I ordered 4 boxes just to be sure not to run out again! The blend is strong yet smooth.
3971;Medium Body, Good Quality Green Tea;I love Harney & Son's Fine teas.  My favorite is their hot cinnamon spice black tea.
3972;Very good;I just ate most of a bag (not bought through Amazon, though the Amazon price seems great).  I had to Google these out to see if others found them as worthy as I did, and indeed they do.
3973;Yummy!;Someone served this at a dinner party long before I knew I should be eating gluten-free, and it was delicious - the same great taste as regular pasta but without the starchy fullness.  Now it's all I serve, even to guests, and some of them have begun eating it, although they could eat regular pasta if they desired.
3974;Great taste but it sure crumbles!;We love the taste but hardly any cookies are whole.  I would have given them 5 stars otherwise.
3975;Good for sensitive Stomach;My boy cat whom we adopted at 6 months age suffered from tummy troubles.  Loose stools, couldn't digest food.
3976;Sweet and Tasty;These packets are awesome to have..
3977;GREAT SALT;THIS BY FAR THE BEST SALT I HAVE EVER TRIED. I HAVE TRIED MANY SEA SALTS OVER THE YEARS, BUT THIS ONE BEATS ALL THE OTHERS HANDS DOWN.
3978;toothpaste...;I bought this at a local store near me thinking it would be a nice alternative to drinking soda or flavored beverages. Maybe its just the mint flavor or maybe its me but it tastes like you are drinking toothpaste.
3979;Nothing special;I bought this on the recomendation of a friend from Atlanta.  It must be a southern thing because I didn't find it anything special.
3980;Arrival report for Haribo Gold Bears Minis;This is one of my wife's favorite candies.  Unfortunately, it arrived on a very hot day and by the time we brought it inside, each packet was melted together.
3981;3g. Fiber Per Serving!;Love these tortilla chips made with organic white corn!  They are perfect for dipping in salsa or eating right out of the bag.  3g of fiber per serving and there are 8 servings per bag.
3982;My cats love these!;These treats are the only ones that one of my cats will eat.  And thank goodness Amazon has them, because most of the stores around me have stopped carrying them, for some reason.
3983;I'll pass...;Not enough flavor, murky brown color, lacking in aroma. I enjoy other varieties from this line but prefer a different brand of rose hip tea.
3984;FINALLY, DISCOUNTED SENSEO PODS...;If you have a Senseo coffeemaker, you already have a favorite pod flavor - ours is Dark Roast and we are always chasing around looking for the least expensive cost of these fairly expensive pods.  Finally, a discount on-line.
3985;Luscious and delicious!;"I found Deep Cello earlier this summer and have been enjoying roastmaster Justin Kagan's great take on coffee.  Every one I've tried I've found terrific and ""High Jump"" is no exception!<br /><br />You can easily tell it's not just another coffee as soon as the beans are ground."
3986;Ditch the Soda and Grab a Mojito;The Mojito is one of my favorite adult drinks.  There are some pretty nasty tasting Mojito mixes out there, but this isn't one of them.
3987;Yummy, but some concern over ingredients;"Simply based on taste, I give this ""Peach Tea"" flavored water-enhancer a pretty good rating. It's certainly a lot better than Crystal Light or some of those other powders."
3988;Yuuummmmm...;I first purchased this Danielle product at all places, Marshalls. I was on my way to the movies, and was looking for something to munch on, and somehow found this bag to look appetizing.
3989;Yummy!;"Started that ""whole 30"" diet which allows Larabars.  What a treat for the palate!  Tastes like a dessert - incredibly filling and satisfying."
3990;Best coffee ever!!!!!!;Truly the best coffee ever. We buy whole bean and grind for every pot brewed!  Perfect flavor.
3991;Not Good at All;Tea is full of rose petals instead of jasmine  white flowers. Taske like Roses too.
3992;Healthy family;I was looking for something sweet that I as a diabetic and my husband and son could all share. Usually if it says sugar free then it means it has a chemical taste.
3993;Great herbal tea. Perfect for Summer.;Lovely herbal infusion. Great qualitly which lends a great flavor.
3994;It's A Bake!;Krusteaz Scone Mix is fantastic..
3995;Excellent for Green Tea & English Tea;I've tried many of the other Stevia sweeteners and honestly they are just not very good compared to Stevia in the Raw. This is an excellent sweetener for green tea, herbal teas and English tea as well.
3996;yami :) .;I'm working out, so I bought it for extra lean protein intake. Like it so far.
3997;MMMMM;My absolute favorite. Very cherry indeed.
3998;Great-tasting rich coffee, low acidity;We love good coffee, but are not experts by any means. After Senseo stopped making their pods, we bought the Coffee Duck/Ecopad pack from Amazon but weren't sure which coffee to use in them.
3999;amish country popcorn;I still had the same amount of unpopped seeds in my microwave popper.  however, the taste is super.
4000;NEVER AGAIN!;WHEN I OPENED THE BAG, I COULDNOT EVEN GET MY DOG TO COME OVER. THEN I TRIED MANUALLY PUT IT IN HER MOUTH AND SHE SPIT IT OUT AS FAST AS SHE COULD.
4001;Stale Seeds;Not very happy that most of the seeds are over-dry or stale.  I usually love Cha-Cha sunflower seeds (spiced) but this bunch must have been an old lot.
4002;Taste kind of strange....;To start, I'm a big fan of Blue Diamond brand Almonds. I really like the bold flavors, Habanero BBQ and Lime & Chili.
4003;I'm In Love!;I am thrilled with the difference this product is making in my life. I have it for breakfast and lunch, so convenient.
4004;Great for Senior Dogs/priced too high;My dog has always consumed and loved pedigree, but with age she had needed some additonal help. The Healthy Maturity formula has all the nutrition needed for healthy joints which has slowed her down lately.
4005;If you are looking for low carb/low sugar this cereal is not for you.;Special K protein plus recently changed up their ingredients.  It states it is better tasting
4006;Smells great but a bit sour;Pros<br />-Mixed with a little water its thick and smells great, just like pizza sauce.<br />-The container is filled right up to the top, you really get your money's worth.
4007;What a surprise!;I've been gone back to my hometown in Calabria, Southern Italy..
4008;Finally! Great tasting, soft, chewy gluten free pizza crusts!;These pizza crusts are wonderful. Each package makes 2-12 inch pizza crusts, or 4 personal size pizza crusts.
4009;Flavored styrofoam;As one who enjoys various types of granola bars, I was looking forward to trying the EAT THINK SMILE all natural granola bars. At 160 calories, with only 35 calories from fat, these sounded like a great alternative to other higher fat items.
4010;Delicious...Helped me get off coffee;I have tried many caffeine-free teas and this is by far my favorite. The black cherry flavor is very real but not candy-ish.
4011;Amazing snack;Can't say enough about these chips.  They are only 3 Weight watchers points and are very satisfying.
4012;the real bold coffee;I've chosen many bolds from the Amazon offers here as well as other on line shops. I always felt there left something more to be desired in each one I tried.
4013;Perfect for trail mix;I wish I could tell you how fantastic these are in a bowl with milk put over them. But when they arrived I was in the middle of making trail mix.
4014;disappointment;They shipped on time, but in the last minute. The product is an entire disappointment! The chocolate on the biscuits melted and solidified again.
4015;Do NOT taste like sugar free cookies.;Good stuff. I despise the taste of processed sweetners and I was hesitant about what they would taste like, but I was not disappointed.
4016;The best all-around licorice;Love this, although I have to be careful not to eat too much due to the high iron content. Would almost get this on subscription, but I don't want to push it.
4017;An excellent supplement!;This is the best magnesium supplement. Highly effective and absorbable.
4018;Perfect for making dinner for the family;This ginger paste gives my food great taste.  I think it tastes better than ginger root purchased at the store.
4019;A bit difficult to mix;Like most people who routinely buy organic products, I'm accustomed to mark-ups in the 10% to 50% range. I usually think it's worth it to know what I'm ingesting.
4020;Great coffee for morning;This coffee is strong and robust without a bitter taste! If you prefer dark coffee with a bold taste..
4021;Taste & Value;We exclusively drink iced tea all the time.  I make it from scratch with a Mr.
4022;Love PB2 Powdered Peanut Butter;I got PB2 powdered peanut butter for mixing in with my morning shakes. I absolutely love it! It tastes great and mixes in great with no clumps.
4023;Our lab loves them!;These frozen treats are perfect on a hot summer day after a long walk.  Our 75 lb lab takes about 5 minutes to eat one of this tiny cups.
4024;good stuff;I had my doubts about this but I bought it anyway and now I must say it's pretty tasty.  I add some splenda and it's quite good.
4025;Read the ingredients label;"I really wanted to like this product.  I am trying to feed my 6 month old baby a variety of foods so he hopefully will not end up a picky eater, but we follow the ""4 day wait"" rule because my husband & I have some food allergies/sensitivities."
4026;Nice green tea - lighter than some, almost sweet;I like it - it is fairly light compared to some I tried.  I did notice that you can get it from Giant Foods Supermarkets (Mid Atlantic Chain) for 3 clams per box if you want to try it before ordering so many.
4027;Flavor okay, not great;I struggled with rating this bar a 3 or a 4.  Taste is only about a 3, but quality of ingredients in providing a healthy and edible alternative to a candy bar rates it a solid 4.
4028;My cat loves paw lickin chicken;Love weruva paw lickin chicken.  It's the only wet cat food my Maine Coon will eat.
4029;"""Doesn't Taste Like Store-Bought""";Store-bought jerky tends to be an excellent source of jaw exercise, but this jerky reminds me much more of the products available at our local farmer's markets.  Excellent flavor (purchased the hickory, trying original next), and an awesome price for such large qauntity.
4030;Definite side effects;First let me say that I eat a healthy, balanced variety of foods, and am not prone to hardly any bodily disorders.<br />I eat lots of bread and cereal, so this seemed a good choice for supposed good benefits.
4031;Oishi!;Delicious sauce.  Its really very good, one of the best Tonkatsu sauces you can get I hear, and I agree, its tastey!<br /><br />however, I bought this for under $4 with tax from the Japanese food store, so this is more then a little over priced.
4032;Little coconut, lots of dates, minimal nuts;I did not think coconut and dark chocolate could ever taste bad.<br />I was expecting mainly those 2 ingredients.
4033;Nothing else like it!;We just recently began to carry this at the grocery store that employs me.  All of my coworkers have tried it, and we simply cannot get enough!  Of the four flavors available, two seem to be tied for the store's favorite: blood orange and grapefruit.
4034;Morning Coffee;I have been drinking Green Mountain Breakfast Blend Coffee for about 3years.  I only drink coffee in the morning & enjoy a lighter tasting coffee & of course the convenience of the K-Cup.
4035;delicious!;After buying coconut chips at Trader Joe's and loving them, I had to find more (I don't live near a Trader Joe's). Found these on Amazon and HOPED they would be the same kind of product.
4036;Flavorful Change;"If you're looking for a flavorful change from boring bitter coffee this is perfect. Full of smooth body rich flavor from the first sip, this finishes with a great coffee taste without a bitter or ""too strong"" ending."
4037;WOWEE;They are light, moist, delicately slightly chewy, sweet of course, and have good ingredients. For you strict vegetarians - don't worry about the egg white .
4038;Little Debbie?;Reminds me of Little Debbie. Its okay, but get something similar at your local store.
4039;Awesome Salt!;I definitely recommend this salt, it's highly nourishing, and relatively inexpensive compared to other natural salts on the market.  Others cost an average of $10.
4040;My kids and family Loved it!!!;It's organic, it's vegan, it's kosher, NO HFCS and they're super tasty. This are the only ice cream cones that my super picky eater son will eat.
4041;My dog loves this food;My Westie Suki loves this food. She had been eating it for most of her life (3 yrs.
4042;Cheaper than the GoLean website;I have been using Kashi GoLean oatmeal for a few years now and I used to be able to buy it locally but no longer.  I then ordered it online from the Kashi GoLean website.
4043;This is NOT an 8 pack!;Deceptive title!  Did not receive an 8 pack, only received one pouch.  Someone needs to revise the title so as not to mislead consumers.
4044;Yummy;This tea is wonderful.  Even my children love it.
4045;down grade;I don't know what happened to my favorite coffee, santa white christmas coffee, but barnies really turned this coffee into tasteless coffee I will never buy again..
4046;These are just plain good;I love protein bars..
4047;The Best DeCaf in K-cups;This is the best decaf I have tasted in K-cups. Perfect cup of coffee, you would have to read the package to know it was decaf, full rich flavor, no bitterness.
4048;Good Product;I speak for a living and loose my voice more than the average person.  I keep these on my desk to soothe my throat.
4049;Perfect Post Workout Shake!!  Delicious!  High Protein!;I tried chocolate and am normally not a vanilla person but since the taste and quality was exceptional, I figured I'd give it a try.  This drink is simply incredible.
4050;Yummy French Vanilla K-Cups;I love this coffee with cream and sugar-free caramel syrup (with Splenda).  It has a smooth taste.
4051;Beyond Shocked!!;Okay,okay..
4052;My Small Dogs Had Trouble With The Size;I have four Chihuahuas. They seemed very interested in the treats, but didn't seem to know quite what to do with them.
4053;Warning;I bought several of these little boxes last night at  Walmart. They have only 40 calories for 5 mini candies.
4054;Decadence cookyfied!;Absolutely the most delicious, decadent chocolate sandwich cooky on the planet! Great nutrition, superb taste, what more can you want? When you open the foil inner pack, the rush of deep, intense chocolate aroma is captivating. Yet another fantastic product from the Late July family.
4055;Best rice-free granola bars!;I'm allergic to rice and it's crazy difficult to find granola bars without rice (or rice flour, etc..
4056;Great food at a fair price;Nature's Variety is a great food at a fair price!  This food has none of the typical cheap fillers that most store bought dog foods have, like corn, soy, and wheat.  It also has no artificial preservatives, like ethoxyquin, BHA, or BHT.
4057;NOT the same as their other kimchi!!!;i bought these when they stopped having the original nong shim kimchi noodles available for subscription. they are NOT the same and htey taste awful!!! there is a super strong fish flavor i do not like.
4058;Taste good but not quite Thai Spicy;I am an expat living in Thailand so I know a thing or two about Thai spicy. While the jerky I received was moist and flavorful, I would not consider it a true Thai taste profile.
4059;How many complaints does it take?;I just sent a complaint to Amazon because, like others, I did not get the item pictured.  I got the restaurant-style container that cannot be closed.
4060;close to gluten pasta;"<a href=""http://www.amazon."
4061;Fiesta Fria tastes great, packaging sucks!;"The product itself is tastes great, but I was extremely disappointed when a little box showed up and ""brown stuff"" was falling out of it! As I was opening the box lots of ""dirt"" like material kept falling out of the box and was getting everywhere.  Inside the box all of the plastic bags of loose tea where just crammed in there and where leaking the loose tea leaves all over the place."
4062;THis thing is huge!;Much better than the over priced super market tiny bottles.  What you should do is save an old bottle and refill it from this with a funnel.
4063;CASBAH HUMMUS;AGAIN, KIND OF A DOWNER COMPARED TO THE FANTASTIC FOODS BRAND.  I KNOW THE INGREDIENTS ARE VERY SIMILAR, BUT SOMETHING IN THE TASTE AND CONSISTENCY IS JUST NOT SPOT ON.
4064;it's amazing if you like a little spice;got as gift from friends who traveled to australia. definitely has a kick, but also has an incredible taste.
4065;The only one!;My mothers cat got very sick from stress & a poor diet of fancy feast for 18 years! Mocha, is a very picky old cat and was vomiting & urinating all over the house. After multiple visits to the vet we tried over 15 different kinds of cat foods to no avail! She was not eating AT ALL! In a last attempt I took a friends recommendation and tried the canned wild salmon food.
4066;Better than I could make at home;I like these bars as a snack because they're only about 140 calories and they taste like homemade banana bread, with the yummy addition of tiny dark chocolate chips. They're probably better than any banana bar I would attempt to bake at home.
4067;Mauna Loa Coffee Glazed Macadamias;These nuts are to die for! And I agree with the other reviewers ..
4068;Super fast organic mashed potates ready in minutes!;In my rural area, I can't find any organic potatoes. I use this to make mashed potatoes, of course, but I use this to make really tasty organic potato soup too.
4069;Great but hard to find in person;This is the only dog food that we've found to work well for our small dog with many food allergies. The ingredients are simple and the pieces are small enough for little dogs to work with.
4070;Tastes great and really easy to use!;I have been having blood sugar and yeast issues, and I've had to cut out sugar.  I had never tried sugar-free Kool-Aid before, so I was a bit nervous about this one.
4071;Favorite treat;These are my four dogs, two Pomeranians, two Shelties, absolute favorite treats. As soon as I go for the bag they dance around my legs with excitment and I can feel good that they are getting a healthy treat.
4072;Kids (and adults) love these!;My kids liked these so much, I tried one.  Very good.
4073;Not my favorite;These always taste slightly burnt to me. Also, there isn't enough salt-to-dough ratio for my tastes.
4074;Yuck!;I love the concept of the Sodastream, but the Cola flavor could be better, even more so when they try to compare it to Pepsi. I know with non-brands there will always be a difference, but this flavor is not good.
4075;Excellent!;I thought I new what good Maple Syrup tasted like.  I was never too impressed with the brands we found in our local grocery stores.
4076;Cramps be gone;I am not a fan of tea. I do not normally drink the stuff, any flavor, any type, for any symptom.
4077;Great for iced tea;Despite the fact that Tetley has iced tea blends, this is excellent for the purpose.  I simply boil 4 cups of water and steep 2 bags in it as long as I like.
4078;Perfect start to a perfect day!;What a great combination of delectable fudge with coffee.  I can have both of my favorites together in one convenient package.
4079;YUMMY! YUMMY! YUMMY!;This is the only health bar, that is the KIND BAR that can compete with such treats as M&M Peanuts, MARS Bars, Baby Ruth etc.,this one dark chocolate with peanuts is my very favorite.
4080;Pamela's Wheat-free Amazing Bread Mix;"<a href=""http://www.amazon."
4081;Good snacks are hard to find!;I am always looking for good snacks. I am overweight and have to much time on my hands.
4082;This is What Soda Should Be!;"When I ordered this drink, I hoped that it would provide a sweet, somewhat more healthy alternative to my usual soda fix.  I wanted to be optimistic, but after the nasty aftertaste from <a href=""http://www."
4083;The Tea of Aristocrats;Having recently been persuaded by several of my closest friends to try a beverage other than coffee, I decided to experiment with several different tea flavors. Although I tired many flavors, I discovered Earl Grey to be among my most prized favorites.
4084;the best......;if you love to cook and want to use the very best ingredients,you have to use Pastene tomatoes.  For sauces there is none better.
4085;No more leg cramps on the bike!;Actually, it's my husband who uses this
4086;Great Idea...;I love food so although nothing will ever replace pasta,I love having these noodles. I did not hear about them until hungry girl! She has plenty of recipes using these noodles so I wanted to try them and she has some great recipes for these.
4087;Almost a 5;I love the can size. I can use one per day rather than covering and refrigerating for the next day.
4088;The best Cinnamon gum on the market;I love this gum.  Stride Cinnamon is hard to find in the stores.
4089;The best tea, delicious!;This is the best tea.  I like it as well as coffee.
4090;coffee!!;This was a bit strong from what I am used to but after drinking it a few times the flavor was great. I was pleased.
4091;Great for sweetening, not for lemon flavor;"I bought these after I bought <a href=""http://www.amazon."
4092;Great Low-Fat Snack;I love chips but don't love all the fat and calories they have.  These are a great alternative.
4093;Sweet tooth coffee drinker will love it!;I purchase a wide variety of k cups for the office staff. This is a favorite amount those who like sweet, flavored coffee.
4094;Lasagna after 15 years;Finally a Lasagna product that tasted great.  I developed an allergy to wheat in my mid 40's and being Italian it is difficult to find products that I like.
4095;Bad beef jerky;I agree with Michael Whitney from Seattle.  The beef jerky tasted ok but was tough as leather to chew on.
4096;Good product, over priced;These are truly delightful cookies, but happily they are not addictive because this manufacturer (family owned or not) is pricing themselves right out of existence. In 2005, one could find them for less than $17/12 pack.
4097;QUICK SNACK;These pork rinds from Lowery are a quick snack, but very easy to over-cook. I like the spicy and wife likes the plain.
4098;This product looks and tastes awful.;I bought these thinking they would be good for travel (they are), taste good (they don't) and help me get more veggies into my then 9 month old. Well he's 10.
4099;Good but...;"I bought this ginger beer while looking for a replacement for Stewart's ginger beer.  It claims to have ""snap""."
4100;Great for my Miniature Schnauzer;"I bought this for my miniature schnauzer who is about 17 pounds and I feed her a heaping cup everyday. Also sprinkled on top is glucosamine pills <a href=""http://www."
4101;Wolfgang Puck Sumatra;I ordered this by accident and I'm so happy I did. This is a new favorite of mine.
4102;I  LIKE ALL THAT SNAPPING AND CRACKLE!;Kellogg's Rice Krispies, I like to eat it in the mornings sometimes with some fruit, a banana or raisins or both and some milk, however what I really like to do is making Treats by mixing it with other Cereals and melted marshmallows. It is Fortified with Vitamins A, C, B6, B12 and E and 1-1/4 Cup is 130 Calories, now that's pretty Good<br /><br />Rice Krispies does not Taste overly Sweet or Stale like some other Cereals, I like eating it right out of the Box, one of Life's simple Pleasures.
4103;Great Soup;This soup is excellent but it is out of this world if using cream of chicken soup and chicken broth instead of water.  Also, I put in cut-up chicken.
4104;Surprisingly my favorite!;"I don't generally go for ""bold"" coffees but I have to say that the flavor of this Newman's Own Special Blend is perfect for my taste.  I often buy Kona coffee blends because they seem less bitter than some others"
4105;Channa;I bought this product to make channa masala.  It was interesting to see the reaction of the people who  only previously had canned chickpeas.
4106;Absolutely delicious (w/ a few modifications) !;I've been looking for a simple way to enjoy gluten-free banana bread for months and came upon Simply Organic Banana Bread mix. I made the mix according to the instructions, adding just the bananas, oil and water.
4107;A great little snack!;I bought these when I was pregnant and had gestational diabetes because they fit within the carbohydrate allowance for a snack. They are tasty and we order them regularly.
4108;This stuff really works!;I use this daily and don't have to reapply like i did with the degree ultra clear red satin. This works well for wetness protection and as a deodorant.
4109;Good Fruit Nut Bars;The Pure Natural bars are a great tasting combination of cranberries, blueberries, pomegranates, almonds and peanuts. The 1.
4110;not like jerky;i had high hopes for this stuff. i have tried several types of veggie jerky, in search of the tough, fibrous, highly seasoned jerky of my old meat eating days.
4111;Dog really likes, but they go fast.;I have an 11 pound Couton De Tulear.  Small sharp teeth.
4112;Tasty, yes Effective, Perhaps;First off I found them at WalGreens for &15.00 (no s&h).
4113;Zuke's Chicken Flavored Mini Naturals Dog treats;Our dog and all the dogs in the neighborhood love the Zuke's chicken flavored mini treats.  The treats are small enough to be able to give frequently to reward good behavior and for training.
4114;Lost a loyal customer- changed formula without notifying customers;My dogs had been eating canidae since they stopped eating their puppy food. They did great on it until yesterday we bought a new bag and they became violently ill after only eating one bowl.
4115;It's Caffeinated Chewing Gum;It's expected to taste weird, but I found it to taste really awful. The spearmint makes it worse, almost accenting the bitterness.
4116;Great gummy sharks;These are great.  Good taste, very fresh and soft.
4117;Great Treats!;My favorite natural pet stores sell these for a higher price.  They fit perfectly into treat toys and my dog loves all of the flavors.
4118;FUN!!!;I used these to make Rocky Road cakepops, which were fabulous might I add. The size is slightly larger than the ones in Swiss Miss cocoa mix but perfect in every way.
4119;Restaurant flavor at home;We are coffee lovers and creatures of habit. Trying something new in the coffee arena is always a chancy proposition.
4120;Disappointed;When I was shopping for a new white chocolate powder I could not find one that listed the ingredients.  I purchased Bellagio because I had confidence in the brand.
4121;Really, really good coffee;I was really surprised how good this coffee is. I bought it on a whim, then brewed a pot of it at work.
4122;Florida;I have been in love with these cereals for a few years. Since they do not carry them anymore in stores where I live, I was trying to find them somewhere else.
4123;creamy raw no salt;raw pieces, creamy taste, pretty nice, maybe a little stale. From India with no exp.
4124;Excellent steaks!;The steaks were excellent.  Much higher quality than the standard Omaha steaks that I have ordered in the past (although those were not bad).
4125;Still the best;"I've tried a lot of different beef jerky products, including <a href=""http://www.amazon."
4126;Chococrack;The other day I stopped by the local Pharmaca and this Chococrack was on sale for 2.49$ a bar, so I picked up the last 5.
4127;Supposed to be bitter?;I've never tasted tahini before, but I wanted to try making hummus. After reading some reviews, I chose this one.
4128;Great;We love this whole wheat pasta. When my husband was diagnoses with diabetes last year we decided to go with whole wheat pasta, he loves pasta but the type made from refined white flour was really messing up his blood sugar.
4129;excellent espresso;"The Gevalia Espresso T- Discs provide an excellent Espresso coffee which is equal to or better than at Starbucks!<br />By experimenting with various combinations I found for those who like the Espresso with milk, use about an ounce and a half of REGULAR milk add the desired amount of either sugar or brown sugar or molasses or Hershey's syrup, in a twelve ounce cup, heat  that in microwave for 22 seconds, then use the milk frother(you can get one at Ikea for 99 cents) for a few seconds to get a light froth- do not over froth - then use that container in the Tassimo coffee machine with the Gevalia Espresso T-Disc, after brewing is complete, hold the brew button for 12 seconds more for additional coffee, after completion stir lighly and drink. I have found that you get almost similar but slightly less satisfaction with ""King of Joe"" Espesso T-Disc also."
4130;Delicious;These are great. They are delicious! I am addicted! I also sell these at my school and people love them.
4131;Now this is my kind of Potato with Steak;I love to order these type of cooked potatoes and they are so great with a steak..
4132;Tastes great...;But with 170 calories, and not particularly nutritious, I would say keep this as a snack as opposed to even unhealthier cookies and candy.<br /><br />Fills you up moderately too, so sometimes I eat these on the go rather than breakfast (not recommended, though!).
4133;very dirty;very dirty, make sure you use plenty of water to clean them, flys, and all types of stuff in it. It takes about 20 mins to cook.
4134;No better creamer out there;I am addicted to this stuff. Price wise, I can buy this at WalMart for $3.
4135;Tasty;This is my first time trying petit fours, and I must say they lived up to what I expected. If you like or want to try petits fours, I don't think you can go wrong with the Swiss colony brand.
4136;Best Freeze Dried Yogurt Starter;I love this product and have been using it for many years now. It makes a perfect yogurt every time.
4137;Great in salad dressing;Before I used the product I tasted it. It has a well rounded salty flavor some where between soy and fish sauce.
4138;Rip Off on Cheetos;DO NOT EVER BUY ANYTHING FROM THIS VENDOR!!!!  I can't believe I was ever stupid enough to pay $30.40 for 3 bags of 16.
4139;not bad for the price;its really no better than that crap jack links. a lot of the pieces are to tough to chew and i eat real jerky all the time.
4140;love it;It is one of the few cat foods that my cats will eat. Fancy Feast is the  best.
4141;Finger-licking good;These are spicy and salty, and highly addictive if you don't worry about the salt content. I am sure after the case of 12 I will die of kidney damage one day.
4142;Great Product, for one main reason.;They are made in GERMANY.  That's the origin folks of gummy bears, as most of you already know.
4143;Excellent flavor;"Sure this is just a packet of seasoning, and you've got to add all the good stuff, but man is the flavor of this awesome! They clearly put some time into choosing what types of dried peppers to use, and blending it. This is not your bland ordinary ""chili powder""."
4144;best hemp;I have been very happy with the quality of this product and with the regular shipment.  I put it all in a large ziploc bag and some in a smaller container to serve out of and it keeps beautifully!  Hempseed is very good for cutting sugar cravings.
4145;It is OK, but not the best of this line of Pasta Sauce's;I have tried 3 varieties of F. Rinaldi's Pasta Sauce.
4146;S. Williams;Purchased this millet flour in January 2012. I have used millet flour before and love it, but my local store stopped carrying organic millet flour.
4147;they taste good but...;i like the taste however they give me sores on my tongue. other flavors dont do this.
4148;Really good!;I first had these in Sweden years ago and I love them in all the flavors.  Lemon is my least favorite, but they are all good.
4149;Great Coffee!!!;If you like strong black coffee this is the stuff for you.  Great delivery, comes packaged in a foil resealable bag.
4150;SEVEN Reasons to buy these;1. AMAZON MAKES THESE AFFORDABLE.
4151;Rooster Sauce...;As you can probably tell from the other reviews, this stuff is the new ketchup. It's popping up in restaurants and other venues, and for good reason: its tastes amazing! I can take really hot stuff, but this sauce isn't about killing your taste buds (or killing you).
4152;French Lavender Super Blue - is just Super!;I was making sachets for Christmas gifts. I looked at many different sites for lavender, paying close attention to the reviews.
4153;love it;i was skeptical when first ordered, but when i prepared it i really liked it. the best thing for me, as a rice lover, is that I im getting much more nutrients from this rice than white rice.
4154;newmans does it again.;We switched up from nutro chicken and rice to newmans own and chip's bowel movements are so much more dense and compact. our vet says its a sign of good food.
4155;Keeps her Busy;My dog really likes this interactive food dispenser. I put her regular dog food in it, when I use it.
4156;Very Good Tea;I ordered this tea for my office. I had requests for Mint Tea and Green Tea - so why not combine the requests, right? I have to say, I've had nothing but compliments.
4157;Tazo Decaf Chai;My wife loves this tea and drinks it in the morning as a pick me up and in the evening to help relax after a hard day's work.  Buying in quantity from Amazon helped make the price very attractive.
4158;Variety is the spice of life;I have 2 dogs and while I don't give a lot of treats, I like to have a variety of items on hand to put in the everlasting ball, Kong etc., to keep them interested on days when the weather is not conducive to getting out.
4159;My Kids Love Them;Our local grocery store quit carrying these a couple of years ago.  My daughters were crushed.
4160;Dogs are undecided!;I didn't know quite what to think about this dog treat & neither did our Bichon, Biscuit, or our golden Retriever, DJ.  It is exactly like a roller ball on a deodorant bottle.
4161;Most Amazing Flakes;Ordered these for the first time, and about to place another order for a back-up bag.  So thrilled with this item.
4162;My baby loves it!;This flavor is great, I love the fact it has veggies and fruit together. I gave this flavor to my 6 month old baby and he loved it.
4163;Yummy!;These are a nice, light alternative to ordinary potato chips. To me, they have a sort of buttery flavor.
4164;Pumpkin, Pumpkin, Where's the Pumpkin;If you need a brick that tastes like flour, is heavy enough to keep the car from rolling, and has no taste, color, or smell of pumpkin or spice, buy this mix. It was quite a disappointment.
4165;This water is delicious!;I'm not much of a water drinker, although I certainly know the necessity. I needed to find something to drink that was palatable--regular water from the tap in a glass makes me choke.
4166;no matter how well packed....;I Love these, tried them the first time at a Costco tasting.  BUT, as the title says, no matter how well packed, the ratio of whole ones to small pieces is about 1 to 50 (*50 being pieces).
4167;Our cats threw up in pain after eating this food;We bought 2 packets (49 pouches in total) a few weeks ago for my 3 cats. One of the cats ignored this food completely to start with but the remaining two ate it.
4168;all the dogs refused them.;We have two dogs and they did not like these treats at all. We tried all the dogs in the neighborhood and out of 14 dogs o.
4169;zukes clean apple crisp;My very picky shih-poo devoured this.  He even kept going back to the wrapper!  Even though flavor preference varies among dogs, these are conveniently available in singles so you can try one without buying a whole box your dog might not like.
4170;Not so good.;If you are looking for STRONG S/V flavor these definitely aren't for you. Very mild in comparison to many others.
4171;tangy;"I enjoyed <a href=""http://www.amazon."
4172;its like kool-aid for adults;I found the taste to be very strong, so only using half of the package per large cup of water is a good idea.  Even just using half the package, there is still a real lot of flavor and it is hard to believe there isn't a lot of sugar in it, as it tastes so sweet.
4173;Tastes Like Celery;I really like pop chips, but this flavor isn't the best. I was expecting these to taste like chili peppers and lime (Spicy, Sweet, and Tart), but instead of going for a chili pepper taste, they went for a chili the food taste.
4174;Best Tasting Coffee I've ever had.;I first had this coffee on vacation in Costa Rica and I ended up bringing 10 bags home with me.  Now I can't live without it.
4175;Wellness canned food has been a lifesaver for our cat!;Our cat, Isabel, has struggled with UTI and weight issues for years. After our vet recommended a wet food only diet, we experimented with a variety of brands (included Rx), but could never find a wet food that made Isabel feel full, and not spend the rest of the day begging us for more food.
4176;Great taste!;I bought this blackcurrant concentrate to use making a macaron filing.  It worked out nicely.
4177;These little things are great;I love beef jerky. It is one of my favorite snacks and these are awesome.
4178;Great substitute for other cheese puffs;Yum Yum!!! I bought a case of these for a camping trip my daughter was going on with her cross country team..
4179;Not to my taste;I have always found pure green tea a bit bland, so I ordered this to see how it tasted. I find it to be a nice blend with a citrus overtone, not bitter at all, but with a taste that is not to my personal liking.
4180;Quite good indeed.;This is a fine, thick candy bar that is neither too sweet nor too bitter. Ever since the Fresh and Easy market down the road has been carrying this, it has become a favorite.
4181;Great bread!;This is a really great all-purpose bread that tastes fantastic. Keep in mind as you make it that the batter will look like batter and NOT yeast dough.
4182;Great Turkey Jerky;I love Jerky.  This is better than the Beef jerkey I gernerally buy.
4183;Great taste, and healthy too!;Bob's Red Mill is an excellent brand, and I've yet to buy anything from them that I wasn't happy with.  This is no exception, and as an ingredient, it's really excellent.
4184;coins from heaven;These coins were a bit hit.  Party goers loved snacking on them and also taking some home.
4185;tassimo t-discs;The cost is considerably less, however the loss of the Starbuck brand and African Kitamu t-discs was a real downer. I have tried many single serve coffees and Starbucks was the best.
4186;Very pleasant but takes some experimentation to find your preferred strength.;"When I first prepared a mug of <a href=""http://www.amazon."
4187;great coffee with no environmental impact;I love my keurig coffee maker, don't get me wrong, but I don't love adding all those little plastic cups to the land fill. The Solofill allows me to end the conflict between convenience and my concern for the environment.
4188;Tangy Italian Spaghetti Dinner;This is my family's favorite spaghetti. It is spicy but not too spicy.
4189;Very Bergamot-y Tea!;****<br />I enjoy bergamot a lot, but this tea was way too fragrant for me
4190;Tellicherry Peppercorns;I really like the fact that the peppercorns arrived in a airtight bag. When I opened the bag the arroma was wonderful.
4191;Great for on the go;Great packets for on the go (even for older kids). They taste good too, and my daughter really likes them.
4192;Very good;Not sweet and syrupy like US sodas. Very refreshing with only 90 calories per 6.
4193;Too Much Flavor;These things are just too darn cheesy. If you like a lot of flavor, you'll love these.
4194;Smooth and refreshing;I love water and this water tastes great and is extra smooth. It is supposed to have a pH of 9.
4195;Everybody wants some!;When I found these soft, chewy candies covered with sugary beads, all in red and deep purple raspberry colors at a grocery outlet five years ago, I ended up purchasing 25 bags.  I generously shared them with almost all my close friends and they loved them.
4196;Arrived moldy!;I buy treats for my dogs in bulk to have them on hand. I opened this package 2 months after purchase, which meant it is too late to return, and found the product to be moldy.
4197;box was delivered leaking all over my front porch;The box was delivered leaking all over my front porch. The person that delivered it had to have known and they snuck off without even knocking on the door.
4198;Healthiest Goji berry you can find.;"No preservatives, no additives, organic, sun dried - many other ""better"" tasting Goji berries have sugar or more often high fructose corn syrup added.  I like the taste, great with tea."
4199;Vegan?;These are the best vegan cookies we've had so far. Found them at a health food store in Colorado, now we order from Amazon.
4200;If you like black pepper and you like potato chips...;Pretty much can't go wrong with these. Very peppery.
4201;Perfect Pectin;This is great stuff.  Very good for small or large batches.
4202;it's like crack for dogs;i've never met a dog who didn't devour this food with tail-wagging, tunnel-visioned gusto. it looks like tiny pieces of beef jerky and if you have a picky eater they'll probably be delighted with this food.
4203;Great baby food!;My baby loves Earth's Best product.  The food is tasty and doesn't cause her constipation problem.
4204;Spicy and Chocolatey!;My favorite tea was Celestial Seasonings' Chocolate Enchantment [..
4205;I love this stuff!!;I love this brand and I have a time finding it here. The price is great! I use it in almost everything.
4206;Fabulous;This is fabulous. Heard about it on Sean Hannity and wanted to try it.
4207;I Panicked!;Went to Walmart to buy the only treats that my fuzzy-buddies will eat.  They didn't have it.
4208;Makes a good cup of decaf;Sometimes I want a coffee but not the caffeine.<br />Decided to try a box of these cups and was pleasantly rewarded.
4209;Noticable Weight Gain in My Dog After Only 6 Days of Feeding Her This;My dog was looking a bit on the thin side, and after ruling out any health issues, the vet suggested that I make changes to her diet. I stopped feeding her the junk they sell at the corner deli and switched to this stuff, and within 6 days there was a visible difference in her body weight.
4210;Scrumptious!;I just tried these for the first time and they're fantastic!  Absolutely delicious and filling.  A bar in the morning with a cup of green tea and I'm good to go.
4211;Best Tea Ever!;This is the best tea I have ever tasted.  This is a crisp,clean beverage with no bitter after taste.
4212;One of the best marzipan products;These are about the size of a snack candy bar, and they are great to eat just like that, straight out of the package. There is no chocolate or any other covering so you get the pure marzipan taste.
4213;Cats still skepticle, though I am firm.;I have been giving this to my cats for nearly two years on an off and on basis. I feel this is healthier than some of the other foods, I can afford.
4214;Pork gelatin!!!!!;I have just found out today that the gelatin in this product is coming from pork. I do not know why they would add gelatin in the first place.
4215;Community Coffe verses French Market;Tried Community Coffee to replace the more expensive French Market coffee. It was not as good and you have to use about twice as much.
4216;I love this product!;It is hard to find this type of K-cups..
4217;Heads up to those who love cooking!;This is the only way to buy herbs and spices!  A large amount of product, well packed in a large, plastic jar and at an excellant price.  Buy, buy, buy.
4218;TUNA SLOP;"Bumble Bee used to be a good brand but it has been on a steady decline in quality.<br />Yesterda I opened a can of Bumble Bee ""Chunk Light Tuna"" in oil and what did I<br />find?."
4219;Kibbles ' n Bits;If you want to find a way to help that young family, older friends or community member
4220;Not too sure...;I can't really leave a fair review on this product because Im not sure if it worked or not. I paired it with Mother's Milk Tea and didn't see any results, but that could just be my own body.
4221;A good shelf-stable lunch to keep handy at work!;This was a good lunch. It heated quickly in the microwave (less than 2 minutes), and I was pleased that it wasn't too salty, which has been a problem for me in the past with some other Hormel brand microwaveable meals.
4222;acquired taste;Lemon and ginger: two very strong tastes!  This is exactly what you want to drink after a big meal, these two herbs in combination, to aid digestion.<br /><br />Tastewise, this is strong stuff.
4223;Exceptional!!!;I absolutely love these brownies.  They are soo good.
4224;Yum;This is my favorite cheaper green tea. One of the few I can stand not sweetened.
4225;Incredible, Incredible Food!!;My pup (3 year old maltese) has a serious allergy to grain and a generally screwed up digestive system. The first year of his life was sort of trial and error when it comes to the right kind of dog food for him and a lot of long nights with upset stomachs.
4226;not like jerky;i had high hopes for this stuff. i have tried several types of veggie jerky, in search of the tough, fibrous, highly seasoned jerky of my old meat eating days.
4227;A gluten-free, highly nutritious addition to cooked cereal & baked goods.;Among the basics I keep in my pantry is this sprouted organic golden flax seed powder. Shelf-stable, it allows the home baker to make a gluten-free version of the Cornell triple-rich baking formula by substituting sprouted flaxseed powder for the wheat germ.
4228;DO NOT BUY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!;I purchased the Waggin' Train brand Duck Jerky and my dog became sick immediately. He was throwing up and also began to lose hair on his ear.
4229;They disappeared before I had even one pack;Obviously, the people in my household love these.  I think I managed to get one pack out of the 24.
4230;Best Almond Butter;We have tried every almond butter on the market, including home made and fresh store made in our local market.  None of the others come close to Barney Butter for smoothness and taste so we keep ordering it from Amazon.
4231;Great;I bought these for my mom and she loves it.  She mixed eggnog with the dark chocolate.
4232;Just like I remeber;Well packaged and shipped quickly by amazon. Instructions in German/English in the back.
4233;Nuts for these nuts!;I like nuts.<br />I eat pistachios and cashews and walnuts and pecans and macadamia nuts all of the time.
4234;Great kitten food;My kitten is 8 months old and we've seen such a change in his coat since switching to this brand of food. Previously we fed him the Fancy Feast kitten food and he liked it but after reading horror stories about the ingredients in most commercial cat foods we decided to switch to something more natural.
4235;Perfect Hot Choc Variety Box;We love this variety box in our house, we subscribe to ensure we never run out.  I use the 'Dark' to make Mocha, my wife loves the 'Peppermint' and i drink the 'Milk' whenever i fancy a hot chocolate.
4236;Great.;I like this honey. It comes in a bigger size, since I use a lot of honey for tea it's easier for me to buy it this way.
4237;THIS PRODUCT CONTAINS WHEAT!;It is my fault becasue i did not see it the first time I read the ingredients, but THIS PRODUCT CONTAINS WHEAT. Our DR.
4238;My 9 month old is crazy for these;They're easy for her to pick up and she loves them over any other finger food I've tried so far. They're also not messy, which is nice for me.
4239;Yum.;I really like the flavor of these chips/crackers. The sesame seed flavor really pops after a few bites and they aren't dry in your mouth like some other multigrain products.
4240;mmmmmmfor chocolate lovers you gotta try this one;I am not usually a lover of dark chocolate, but when a friend gave me this chocolove premium dark (55%) orange peel as a gift, I fell in love with it. So for Valentine's I decided to buy a box and give my special friends a bar for a happy.
4241;Delivery satisfaction;The product is one we have used for many years and our little dog clearly enjoys it. For family reasons we are in rural Tennessee for much longer than anticipated and the supply of dog food we brought with us was getting low.
4242;Cutest Little Pods of Coffee;I read reviews on this product and was a little concerned that they were not K-Cups, but made for K-Cup machines.  No concern was ever needed.
4243;Delicious;I first discovered this tea at Panera. When I couldn't find it in my usual haunts I resorted to Amazon which, of course, had a source.
4244;Blue Agave;Very pleased, taste great & like that it doesn't spike your blood sugar as other sugars do.  We use in our coffee everyday, but many other uses for it besides that.
4245;Yummy;I just love Terra Chips. They are great for those of us who are looking for a healthy alternative to regular chips.
4246;Delicious;My daughter is gluten/casein free and these are our standard lunchbox snack.  Foods can be limited since most schools won't allow you to pack peanut products in lunchboxes due to peanut allergies in other children.
4247;1st Time, great!;The first time I ordered this coffee from Amazon, I thought it was excellent, it had a bold, rich taste.  The 2nd time I ordered it, it didn't seem to be the same coffee, lacked the bold, rich taste.
4248;Perfect for caramel apples!;This caramel melts well and hardens perfectly for caramel apples. I add just a tiny bit of water (maybe a tsp) while it's melting just to smooth it out a bit.
4249;Dog Loves It;My 1 year old lab/border collie loves interactive toys. This one keeps her attention and provides her mental stimulation.
4250;Yum city!;Cranberry almond KIND bars are my favorite flavor.  The bonus is that they have a low glycemic index.
4251;Much cheaper;Buying this product in the bigger box and all together makes it much cheaper. the way the economy is today you have to save every way you can.
4252;Original Idea---Kombucha from a Tea! And Decaf, too!;*****<br /><br />This Organic Green Tea Kombucha Decaf from Yogi Tea is certainly unique. It tastes like a mixture of passion fruit, plum, ginger, and green tea.
4253;Very Cute...and Yummy!;These are so cute. It is sometimes hard to tell from the pic all of the details.
4254;Delicious;A delicacy I became addicted to while in England
4255;This tea is tops.;This is one of my favorite teas.  The double dose of Bergamot gives this Earl Grey a wonderful flavor.
4256;"Taste more like ""Tomato and Basil"" than ""Chili and Lime""";NOTE: This review is for the Chili and Lime Flavor Popchip.  Amazon had a separate page for it but then merged the product and its reviews into one.
4257;Great snack....even during battle!!;I'm a former Marine, got out after 8 years, did two tours in Iraq and one in Afghanistan. I was first introduced to beef jerky during MCT (Marine Combat Training).
4258;WAYYY TOO HOT AND I LOVE IT!!!!;WOW, this is HOT! I am a daredevil when it comes to hot food and adding ONE LITTLE DROP is all you need to make you cry home to your mommy, I have read on a previous comment that you should only use a drop and BELIEVE ME when I says this..
4259;Yum!;These are pretty good!.  They remind me of Chips Ahoy.
4260;Yummy (or so it appears);My golden loves this food.  We recently changed her from an organic food we couldn't find or have shipped.
4261;My Perfect Cheese Combo!;Amazing good and almost addictive. I would not have been nearly as happy with any oter combination of cheese flavors.
4262;Yummy!;"These are pretty darn good cookies!  I prefer <a href=""http://www.amazon."
4263;GROSS!!!;I ordered this tea because I am trying to stop drinking coffee. I love mango, and I love peach so I thought this would be perfect.
4264;As good as Bentley's, MUCH cheaper at Amazon.com.;I never liked Earl Grey til I had Bentley's.  It was a gift, far too expensive for my daily tea.
4265;Mom's Favorite;My mom loves this coffee/chocolate blend.  It has just the right amount of chocolate and is very smooth.
4266;decent cup of tea;Higgens & Burke English Breakfast Black Tea is a nice, strong cup of black tea without being too overpowering or containing any hint of bitterness.  It makes for a really good morning cup of tea, easy to prepare, but considering that I've had quite a few English Breakfast blends, it didn't stand out as anything spectacular.
4267;I have a brand new dog!!;Oh my goodness..
4268;Very creative!;What an interesting treat! Yes, you may feel the flavor of raw cacao, but this aspect is mild, and you may not even notice it if you don't focus on it. What you are more likely to notice is how elegantly it's crafted in terms of mouthfeel (both the chocolate itself and the combination of the chocolate and the filling).
4269;Okay but a little strong of a taste;These are okay cookies, and they keep well, but the chocolate taste is a little overwhelming for me. I'm not sure if there's some bitterness there, too.
4270;Delicious!  (note it has cheese);Love this minestrone as an easy, filling meal for baby.  I was disappointed to see it has cheese on the ingredients, as we are avoiding cheese for our infant.
4271;Yummy Grapefruit Candy!;These Haribo Pink Grapefruit candies are yummy!  They smell<br />exactly like a real pink grapefruit and the taste is divine.<br />Unlike Haribo's traditional gummies, these are coated with<br />fine granulated sugar which does make them a little sweeter,<br />but they're a nice change.
4272;Chocolaty Goodness;As a fan of chocolate I couldn't miss the opportunity to taste test Newman's Own Organics Dark Chocolate.  Probably the only drawback was that I was going to have to share some with my wife.
4273;Yummy;The first time I made this I added sharp cheddar cheese and some garlic to make garlic cheese rolls.  So very good.
4274;Get the original while it lasts;"After the popularity of the Slim Jim waned in the years following revelations that the alleged ""macho"" of its celebrity endorser was merely spray-on tan, we endured a series of tasteless and unsnappable tinkerings to the original recipe.<br /><br />Sadly, by the early days of this century, the original recipie had been lost."
4275;Perfect!!!!;Looking for a treat whose protein is low (My pets get ample from their Dick Van Patten's Ultra Original) was made in the USA and Organic.<br /><br />The size of the treats are US Quarter in diameter and the thickness of 2 Quarters.
4276;Whiska's Purrfectly Fish and Purrfectly Chicken Improved My Cats' Health;I used to never feed my cats wet food because they preferred dry and I thought it was fine as long as they drank plenty of water.  After losing one cat to death mysteriously and another one to kidney disease I decided to follow the advice of many on the web and switch to wet food.
4277;Future of Food;Much food that is utterly worthless can be, given some diligence, reinvented in a usable form. This is a good example.
4278;Clean & Light;This is a more refreshing coffee.  Tastes clean, rather than a dirty/overwhelming experience.
4279;Pain is Good #37 Garlic Hot Sauce;I have to say that I find this particular bottle disappointing.  I have purchased this item before in New Orleans and the flavor was better than the recent bottle I have received.
4280;getting smaller all the time;It's a tootsie roll, but there's not much of it.  These are very small, almost tiny.
4281;Great for dog training;our dog responds to this more than any dog treat.<br /> We have tried many different treats, but this seems to be the one that is most preferred.
4282;Best rice ever!;This is the only rice we ever use. We love it.
4283;Dove for Men and more;I tried this product after using a few other 'Men's' body washes when I didn't want to smell like a fruit or a flower. After tiring quickly of the 'sport scent' types, this was a refreshing change, pun intended.
4284;Love Kettle Chips, but not this flavor!;I was really looking forward to trying these chips since I love cheese but I was SUPER DISAPPOINTED! I am a big fan of Kettle Chips but these tasted somewhat stale and almost plain! They are supposed to have a cheddar taste but you cannot taste any of that..
4285;So good that I'm angry at myself;For four years, I've been drinking another brand's Donut-shop blend, because I thought it was good. It turns out I've been drinking substandard coffee.
4286;Fresh and delicious;My two cats will eat anything. So why do I even care what they eat? I care because it's about their health and it's a important responsibility I accepted when I adopted them.
4287;Not The Best Option Out There...;I had high hopes for these bars..
4288;Good stuff!!;Very nice stuff. Not too sweet (not sweet at all).
4289;What butter?;My order was not shipped due to the heat of the summer.  I ordered thinking they would pack it with dry ice or some other method of keeping it from melting.
4290;recalled product send to me;Diamond foods had a voluntary pet food recall in Spring 2012.  This order included Chicken Soup for the Pet Lover's Soul products (dog and cat food) that both were involved in the recall.
4291;classic;My brother had me try these once, and i've liked them since. the gum loses its flavor a little too quickly but i enjoy it all the same.
4292;Good coffee.;I've been buying this product for over a year.  Nice taste, not too strong or weak.
4293;David Rio Flamingo Vanilla Decaf Sugar Free Chai;I have bought this brand of Chai for years and love it.  It is so satisfying and different from the decaf coffee I was drinking.
4294;WOW! THIS IS LO-CAL?!?;THESE CHIPS HAVE A VERY UNIQUE CRUNCH, AND ARE VERY TASTY. I NOW BUY THE VARIETY PACKS BECAUSE I LIKE ALL 6 FLAVORS.
4295;I love this stuff;Yes, that is correct. This product, I feel will be soon the number one seller on Amazon Grocery.
4296;IT WORKS!;The EVO 95 has been the one thing that has stopped my cat from bleeding when he uses his litterbox..
4297;Perfect;Just as u all know it. Cheerios are delish.
4298;My new found favorite.;These cookies are delicious. I first tasted them when a box came in a Mother's Day gift basket.
4299;Didn't taste right;The acai berry and dark chocolate just don't seem to mix well.  The dark chocolate pomegranate is much better.
4300;Great;I have a box of these sent once a month, it is a great price. I send them to my son in Afghanistan he loves them and so do his buddies.
4301;So Far the Kitties Aren't Buying It;UPDATE to the review below: First I'd like to downgrade this to a two star, but the system won't let me..
4302;Great low fat and CRUNCHY SNACK;This is a fabulous healthy snack. 120 cals, 1 fat, 3 fiber and 6 protein for 1/2 cup serving.
4303;dog food review;I have been using this dog food for quite some time, until my dog started throwing up and basically wouldn't eat much of this dog food anymore like he used to.  I stopped feeding him this dog food and bought organic.
4304;Not suggested for heavy chewers or super smart dogs;I have a toy poodle who is very toy motivated (and heavy into chewing as a puppy to boot), so my husband bought this for her thinking it would keep her occupied, at least for a good 20 minutes. Unfortunately, she had the treat portion out of the rubber holder in less than 5 minutes and our other dog (who, incedentally is food motivated) was eating it, and she was soon looking for something else to chew on as a puppy.
4305;Great cake decorations!;My grandson wanted a lizard birthday cake this year.  I had every intention of actually hand-piping a big lizard on the cake.
4306;Weight Watcher Friendly Chips;These chips are very good and are only 2 points a serving per Weight Watcher points calculator.  I like the Barbeque Popchips best and having them in a single serve bag prevents me from eating more than a 0.
4307;Dinner for Every Month;I got this Dinner of the Month Club pasta meal as a gift from a very special person back in CT where I used to live--I believe they are one of the leading gourmet presents companies nationwide.<br />The pasta is ready literally within 15 minutes--a quick meal is a good thing, especially for a single guy like me who doesn't have the time of day to cook complicated stuff--and not only that, it tastes excellent! (I added some parmesan cheese to the sauces that I got in my fridge and it made it even better).
4308;Tastes a lot like dog food;I thought this was a great deal in the warehouse deals section, but it was pretty nasty and smelled like dog food when I opened each bag.  Slim Jim is made of crap too but at least it tastes good.
4309;One of the BEST bars and flavors;I absolutely LOVE the Chocolate Cononut Chew Larabars!  I have tried most of the larabar flavors and the taste and texture are delicious with all the flavors I have tried.  This is my absoulte fav with only 5 all natural ingredients.
4310;The Best so Far;I really like this starter. I tried a different brand and it turned my yogurt sour and it was very soft.
4311;Cats went nuts for them;After getting over their initial suspicion of the new food treat, my cats wanted more, more, more! I was even suspicious at first because the treats seemed awfully hard. But once in kitty's mouth, the nibblet moistens a little and the cats just crunch away.
4312;"Not for the ""occasional"" chocolate fancier";YUM!  All you ladies out there who are chocolate addicts, thank Kellogg's for coming through for us!  Wow, is this stuff awesome!  Imagine little puffs full of rich chocolate, oozing out and gushing all over your mouth, while floating in milk.  Now you don't have to dunk your cookies to get the same effect!  Wow!  It is quite rich to eat for breakfast, no doubt there, but if  you're used to having chocolate chip pancakes, well, by all means, indulge!  This does have some good things in it besides chocolate - whole grains too.
4313;Very Unique;I took these over to a friends house and tried them with amazing results. After sucking on the pill and letting it dissolve for a few minutes, it really did make everything sour, taste sweet.
4314;Perfect snack!;A co-worker shared her coconut chips with me yesterday and I liked them so much that I immediately went to the internet to see where I could buy them.  Living in a secluded place, there is no store close by but the company suggested I try Amazon.
4315;Delicious, alone or cooked in a dish;I love Vigo's canned octopus and both the marinade or oil packed is wonderful alone as an exotic snack or cooked in a dish.  Here is how I cook it, I empty the can into a medium heated sauce pan and when the marinade/oil is hot add drained canned garbonzo beans and saute till the garbanzo beans are soft and tender and have absorbed the yummy liquids flavoring them like the octopus, during the process I add either fresh sliced green onions, or onion powder, a little garlic, mushrooms and you can add chopped green or red bell peppers or fresh chopped tomatos or both for color.
4316;My little old man LOVES this food;My little 15 yo Siamese has one very small kidney and needs to be on a special low protein diet.  My vet recommended Hi-Tor Neo a couple years ago and he took right too it.
4317;The Barbeque Popchips Are Awesome!;I first tried a small bag of the Barbeque Popchips on a business trip in California.  They were so good I bought several extra bags and brought them home with me for my kids to try (9 and 10 year olds).
4318;GREAT;i like the small containers.  it's easy to use and you don't have big bottles taking up space in your fridge.
4319;Love these cookies!;Pamela's makes the best cookies for Gluten Free folks! The texture is perfect, crumbly but not pasty or sandy. The taste is also great! I have my favorite flavors, but in general, you cannot go wrong with this brand of Gluten Free cookie.
4320;This beverage is AWESOME!;It is difficult to find this product in WV.  I was so glad when I saw this on Amazon.
4321;Yummy, but with a hint of sourness;This makes a great quick meal whether your in school or anywhere, just pop this in the microwave! There is plenty of meat,potatoes, but lacks carrots and peas. It tastes great except there is a slight sourness to the soup.
4322;Decent coffee;"I used to use Tassimo, and switched to Keurig when Starbucks went to Keurig (it's all family members drink).  Compared to other Starbucks blends, this one tastes less bitter, ""smoother"" perhaps."
4323;HIgh pH (alkaline) Water has bland taste;Water is normally neutral pH. Distilled water is 7, making it neither an acid (low pH) or a base (high pH).
4324;A Little on the Sweet Side;I love snow balls and Hawaiian Shaved Ice sells good flavors..
4325;Aluminum Free Baking Soda;I bought this Baking Soda to clean my teeth 3 times a week.  They say that teeth become noticeably whiter.
4326;Excellent Raw Cashews;After shopping several places for more economical raw cashews than my local health food market, I decided on this item. They arrived quickly and are great nuts, however, my only complaint would be how they were packaged.
4327;Red Mill ground flax seed.;The flax meal is very good, as good as can be purchased at the store but cheaper if bought in quantity.  I use it mainly on breakfast cereal.
4328;Good deal;Great cup of coffee. Good price.
4329;Inkos white tea;Great product for those that don't enjoy sweet tea.  Pleasant but Mild flavor and very thirst quenching.
4330;I love this tea!;First and foremost make sure you DO NOT let this tea steep too long. If you let it steep for the recommended two minutes, you shouldn't have to run to the bathroom like your pants are on fire! If you let it steep for the 2 minutes, it's a decent trip to the bathroom.
4331;Excellent;This mix is slightly sweet and a very nice, smooth dark chocolate flavor. I will likely order more before the hot chocolate season ends.
4332;NOT Comvita;The honey is a mid amber color. It was good but not the best honey I've had.
4333;Delicious;I was introduced to the village mixes brand a few years ago. A friend brought some brownies to a party and everyone went crazy over them.
4334;Great scone mix;Home made scone with home made vanilla latte.  Yum.
4335;So delicious!;I have to say I love all of Daelia's biscuits.  The hazelnut fig is delicious, this is a great product that I would highly recommend to anybody.
4336;Dogs like it!;I am only reviewing the Bacon flavor, but my dogs picked up on how this works pretty quickly and love the taste of it.  At first they wanted to bite the bottle and chew it like a treat but I worked with them for about a minute or so and they got down that you only lick it.
4337;Tastes good but I prefer regular;Well this ceral sure does taste pretty good but it is as good for you as the regular (as someone else posted). I will say that this ceral is rather sugary tasting, so if your not in to the sweets, you may not want to buy it.
4338;The Best Cookies Bar NONE!;I've been enjoying Uncle Eddie's Vegan Oatmeal Chocolate Chip + Oatmeat Raisin for years. They are the best store bought cookies I've ever had.
4339;Good flavor for a vegan product;This is a generic review of all Dr. McDougall RightFoods food cups, not this specific one.
4340;Rich flavor;I was looking for a replacement for dark roast ( now hard to find in grocery store) senseo pods, this was  a great find. I use one of these pods and one vanilla senseo pod, in a two pod holder, push the 2 cup button twice,  and really enjoy a big mug full of this rich coffee.
4341;SLOW SERVICE;Product is OK for the price. Shipment was damaged and undeliverable.
4342;Say Shalom to Salsa!;It's Super Bowl time, and I want to throw the most kick-pigskinniest party possible. As they say, gridiron greatness comes but once a year.
4343;Great tasting shake. More recipes, and info.;Starting with the blender half full of water.<br />I make 3 to 4 servings of each, use it in 3 days or less.
4344;Coffee;This was a disappointing order. The coffee taste like instant coffee which is stated on the product.
4345;Good Coffee;Good coffee. little caramel flavor.
4346;Yummy gluten-free cookies, great price!;My husband has to have gluten-free food and he LOVES these cookies.  The problem was they were pretty expensive at our grocery store.
4347;Gives Instant Happiness and Energy;I noticed I become extremely happy after drinking this tea..
4348;Keeps my pup occupied much longer than regular bully sticks!;These bully springs are excellent for dogs who tend to scarf things down quickly. My French bulldog (28 lbs) would chew half weay through a regular 6-inch bully stick and then basically swallow what was left.
4349;cherry candy is great, gum center is mediocre;the outer candy shell has a very pleasant cherry flavor. but the inner core of gum is pretty low quality and unpleasant to chew.
4350;Sorriest excuse for a dog treat I have ever purchased;"Product says ""duck wraps rawhide treats"", sounds great, right? well this is the sorriest dog treat I have ever purchased, and I have purchased a lot of them.  First, there is no duck, the item is coated with some brown crusty dyed-on stuff, looks like it is painted on."
4351;Best Balsamic Vinegar;I purchased this balsamic vinegar several years ago when I was last in Tuscany. It is certainly expensive but worth every dime! This is true balsamic vinegar that has been cooked and aged properly.
4352;yummy;I got pounds of this to make Lego lemon cake (because it has sour flavor and my son loves lemon cake) and for the goody bags. It was a big hit.
4353;so tasty!!!;Mom and kids, even toddler babe love this. The mix is so good.
4354;Excellent condition but leaves hair oily;I tested two Clear Scalp and Hair Beauty products.  The Shampoo rated beyond excellent for me.
4355;Not worth trying;It was very hard to put on a round cake. It wouldn't stick and then when I added more water to try and get it to stick the black bled and turned the white purple.
4356;divinity;it was if god himself were in my mouth sitting on a lawn chair while drinking something really tasty and cool..
4357;So-So taste to low acid coffee;The taste of this brew is somewhere in between low end Folgers and a high end gourmet brew with great flavor.  It's not as bad as cheap, commercial coffee but still has a slight hint of that 7-11/gas station/Folgers like taste.
4358;Very rich, flavorful coffee!;While in Costa Rica I had many coffees but I think my favorites overall is Cafe Britt.  The Cafe Britt Poas is especially good, very smooth yet rich and no harsh bite.
4359;Great for my daughters need;I got my daughter a small gum ball machine for Christmas, and this will keep her stocked for a while. It's flavor is not the longest lasting, but my daughter also doesn't chew it for very long.
4360;AWESOME TEA!;Someone left the tea at my house and I decided to try it.  It is wonderful.
4361;"Great Dark Chocolate for ""on the go"" but pricey";My wife loves these dark chocolate pearls because she can keep a box in her purse. The box is metal and seals well.
4362;I just love this soda;I don't drink soda, but somehow I got suckered into trying this, and now I am seriously addicted.  It is a little bitter, not too sweet, not too bubbly and unfortunately 130 calories a can.
4363;MOCAFE Azteca D'Oro 1519;I had 6 sample packets 1.25 oz.
4364;Dad's Chocolate;My Dad decided he no longer wanted See's Candy for Christmas. He just wanted good old Snickers Bars.
4365;Tastes really great;These do really taste great without having to toast them if you want a healthy snack any time of day. I got them because they were identified as vegan.
4366;My puppies love these;I use them for rewards and my two Havanese puppies love them.  They are very particular about<br />their treats, but will do everything I ask to get these.
4367;Baby likes it enough to eat it however, I just found out it's plastic #7;I gave the product 5 stars in an earlier review and am updating it. I was looking at the product I received from Amazon, which was placed at the doorstep in a hot sunny day.
4368;NewGrandma;Excellent steel cut oats and I love the tin can which I will keep!  My grandson eats these much faster than he will traditional rolled oats.  Especially yummy with raisins, pecans & cinnamon.
4369;A nice energy booster.;The No Fear energy drink is designed to give you a boost in energy when you need to be alert, or are feeling tired. I have tried several energy drinks in the past, and this one is a good option.
4370;LOVE THIS BAR;i am a fan of power crunch, i work in a gym, so i am constantly overlooking protein bar nutrition, i picked power crunch because its not high on sugars and carbs, and all the junk protein bars may contain. i usually take a bar to school or work as a snack and i also have one after a work out, as well as a protein drink.
4371;Nothing like Passionfruit;This tea does not smell or taste like passionfruit and is truly disgusting. I had to work to simply get through the one and only cup of this stuff I made.
4372;peach extract;This does not taste any way like peaches we grow in Georgia I wasted over $14.00.
4373;Eden organic extra virgin olive oil;I like the taste of the oil.  It has a dark glass bottle to protect the oil form light.
4374;Smart Puffs Real Wisconsin Cheddar;Boy was I dissapointed in these babies.  I thought that they would taste like an actually puff, but they tasted like nothing, honestly.
4375;It'll Put Hair on Your Hot Dog!;I decided to go shamrocks-to-the-wall this St. Patrick's Day.
4376;Great Pretzel and Gluten Free;My son is Gluten free and Casein Dairy free and he loves these pretzels. I tried them and they taste good.
4377;Fixed My Dogs Hip;I rescued my havanese dog from a breeder who was going to put her down for a hip deformity. Turns out the hip was fine but the ball on her leg bone was broken sometime when she was a puppy.
4378;Zukes Mini Naturals - Healthy Treats;"Our toy poodle loves these treats!  We use them for training and for maintaining bathroom breaks outside.  We use these smaller treated for ""pee"" rewards and larger ones of another brand for ""poo"" rewards."
4379;Like a mini strawberry pie and without the gluten!;I love every flavor of Betty's Bars. They are all just like a mini pie and perfect proportion.
4380;Sage tea definitely promotes a good night's sleep.;It was touted by a friend as a sleep inducer, so I tried it and it works.  It tastes kinda mediciney, but it definitely does the job.
4381;Tasty and good for you!;I really like this Zola with blueberry - its pretty tasty with lots of good flavor in every sip. This is a large bottle and I likely drank more of my portion in one sitting, so I had to share it.
4382;Excellent;Awesome flavor, great texture, just the right amount of pepper to give you a great tingle to the taste buds.  Definitely one of the best.
4383;Perfect;As soon as I removed the seal from this jar, I knew I'd be happy with it.  This is the perfect product to buy if you're not able to get traditional Turkish coffee ground with cardamom, but have to settle with a generic roast.
4384;Pucker up;I grew up eatting saladitos but since I have moved to Florida they are hard to come by.  Every now and then I crave something salty and this does it.
4385;Great value!;I bought these to give to my students. I have around 30 students, so it was economical for the first day of class as a snack.
4386;Kodiak Cakes are GREAT!!;Really love the flavor and texture. So much better than bland old regular pancakes.
4387;On sale;Usually do not get the breakfast blends but it was on sale and decided at price would try it out. It was not as weak as some breakfast blends tend to be.
4388;Great value, great for your health;I didn't actually notice that this was the non-organic version until it arrived, though that doesn't bother me.  One other difference is the amount of tea per bag.
4389;Excellent Coffee & Great Amazon Deal!;Not only is this some very tasty coffee, Amazon offers it at a very good price.  I'm quite pleased with this purchase and can recommend it to others with no reservation.
4390;not as good as claimed;As someone on a low sodium diet I have to make many types of food which most people buy, such as applesauce,bread, ricotta,and granola. I think these bars-and other Larabar flavors- taste 'chemical' to the point that they verge on artificial, despite being haled as all natural.
4391;7 month old puppy loves them!;I have a 7 month old poodle that's 7.8lbs, she just loves them.
4392;Better than average;This is a better than average coffee as compared to store bought.I like this better than starbucks breakfast blend or house blend.
4393;Stays fresh and great taste!;I have ordered this jerky several times over the past few years, but never bothered to write a review because I was satisfied with the product.  Now that I have read the negative reviews, I am compelled to comment that I have been happy with all the orders.
4394;My favorite tea!;I got addicted to this tea when I went to visit some friends in England. I had never enjoyed unflavored tea with milk before, but my friends drank this all the time and I started drinking it as well.
4395;Decent if you lack a grinder;Now that I have a coffee grinder, I buy whole-bean coffee nowadays, but this Illy pre-ground coffee was adequate back in the day. The instructions on the side of the can -- I can't remember what the instructed proportions are -- will produce unusually weak coffee.
4396;glad i saw this .;i have the star trek pezs and i thought why not get one of the star wars pezs. i mostly wanted the princess leia pez .
4397;salty;a little too salty for me but tasty.  I hope my taste buds aren't just acting up.
4398;know your type of coffee maker and purchase accordingly;This is GREAT coffee, but make certain that you know what type of coffee maker you have and buy accordingly..
4399;Gross!;I just cannot understand the high praise these chips have received.  I ordered the variety pack and am very disappointed.
4400;Very satisfying;"The ""non coffee"" Grove Square K-cups are great. Very tasty, convenient, and at a good price."
4401;Best flavored seeds, yet you can't find them in any stores;Who the hell wants to buy pickle or nacho cheese flavored seeds? Yet, for some reason, they are sitting next to every cash register in America. Meanwhile, this is the greatest flavor to ever exist, and you have to scour the internet to find them.
4402;Great but...;This gum has a great taste to me and it does freshen your breath but..
4403;Way too good!;This combination sounds unlikely: chocolate, chili, and dried cranberry. You'll just have to trust me for it, the mix works and works beautifully.
4404;Nectar of the angels if not the gods;Still delicious after all these years and the recent tweaking of the formula and name.  Even though I think there's a tad less fruitiness about it, it remains my go-to hot drink in the mornings and in the evenings.
4405;Chocolate Raspberry flavor;I was surprised how much raspberry flavor the coffee has.  The coffee has a nice aroma and a suddal chocolate flavor.
4406;This was a very sick plant when you sent it to me..horrible;the 9greenbox -box..
4407;Used to be excellent product, now watered down, I'll tell you why;Having worked in the canned seafood industry, I sampled this product at work for consistency, quality, and taste. It was EXCELLENT back in 2007.
4408;I Don't Get It;After the glowing reviews I purchased this cat food for my 3 rescue kitties.  It seemed a reasonable price for higher quality food.
4409;Amazing!;At first this tea may sound like a strange combination, this mostly can be summed into one question: chocolate TEA? I was apprehensive, but all the flavors are appealing separately, so why not put them together? I love Revolution Tea, I always find them to have to freshest, most flavorful tea. I even bought expensive loose leaf tea and it wasn't nearly as good as Revolution Tea.
4410;this coffee rocks;I first had this coffee in the strip district  of Pittsburgh Pennsylvania it is the best correspond I ever had. The blend of the cinnamon and hot peppers give it a taste all it own .
4411;Healthy and Delicious;I was very satisfied with my purchase of Nutiva hemp seeds. I ordered a 2-pack of them and it arrived fairly quickly.
4412;No Taste;I love popcorn. That said, I won't be eating the remaining 11 bags from this case.
4413;Pretty good, but ....;This popcorn was pretty good although like some of the other reviews read ..
4414;Delivers what was promises;Wolfgang Puck's Chef's Reserve Colombian (Dark Roast) is basically what they said it will be. Dark roast, but not too strong.
4415;If you enjoy good coffee, give this a shot;Quick Review:  Island Roasters 100% Jamaica Blue Mountain Coffee<br /><br />I recently received a pound of this coffee as a gift, and looked forward to getting to sample some 100% Jamaica Blue Mountain coffee.  The short version:  AMAZING!!!  I actually had to wait a couple days after trying the first sample to write this review.
4416;Too High On Carbs, Low On Protein;I am not rating this food with three stars because I dispute the quality of ingredients, or that it's one of the healthiest commercial dog food available on the market. Wellness is an excellent brand, more importantly, one whose quality control I trust.
4417;Tasty;I played in a golf tournament where these were included in a little snack bag in the cart.  After about 11 holes and 14 beers I decided I was hungry enough to give them a shot.
4418;Tastes good but packaging sucked;Coffee itself is good not too bold.  Had 2 broken cups in the box which made a mess everywhere.
4419;Best Ginger Snaps in the World;Anna's Ginger Thins are so good that, once we discovered them, we started buying them by the case!  These cookies have a wonderful ginger taste and they go great with hot tea or coffee.  They are very thin, as the name implies, so they are easy to bite into and they almost dissolve in your mouth.
4420;These are great-nice texture, really crispy. Super treat. Worth the calories!;I've found a new taste treat. I'm not a big one for potato chips, so I am sure I've come late to discover these.
4421;Lipton Cold Brew  Ice Tea Bags;Lipton Cold Brew Ice Tea Bags  are great!  I've used them since they came out and I can't say enough about them.  I drink this iced tea year round (I'm not a coffee drinker) and<br />I love it.
4422;Best Coffee;This is a great tasting coffee, bold and strong.  K-cups are the best way to ensure a delicious, fresh cup of coffee at any time of the day or night.
4423;Great choice for snacktime!;We LOVE these cookies!  We take them for snacks at my son's preschool, and they love them because it's makes for a fun letters exercise.  They taste great, and make me feel better about offering cookies after a meal, since they are made with wheat flour.
4424;Great condition and speed!;I just got my plant a few days ago, but so far it is doing great! It came really fast, and was in great condition when it arrived. All the leaves were green and the plant was healthy.
4425;Outrageous Price;My cat loves this stuff, and would order a case but paying over $18 for shipping is ridiculous. Their total price makes this stuff almost twice the 89 cents that this is available for at the corner store.
4426;White Tea;This tea does not taste or look like any white tea I have ever had, I will stick with silver needle in the future.  Will not buy again.
4427;Great flavor combinations;Great, healthy snack.  The combination of fruit, nuts, seeds, and spices is a great idea.
4428;Great product;I have tried many different brands of coconut oil, and my kids like this the best, I found even better price on iherb.com, use LOV684 to get $5 off your first order.
4429;Healthy Breakfast;I had had a very hard time trying to find Quaker Banana Bread Oatmeal.  I was quite excited when I found it at Amazon.
4430;Throat Soothers;I love these. I work with actors all of the time and they got me hooked on these as a sore-throat cure.
4431;Quite possibly the grossest marketed drink I've ever had a sip of;I love Kahlua. I love Coffee.
4432;great first solid food;This is a great first cracker..
4433;Fiber Bars;For those who are in a hurry in the morning, this is a great way to get a quick and easy breakfast that is also healthy. It is also a great snack as well.
4434;Does the job;This sauce pump works adequately with the larger Torani sauce bottles.  I'm only giving four stars because I find it clogs pretty frequently with the Torani Mayan Chocolate sauce.
4435;Goes beyond just for salads;We have been using the McCormick Perfect Pinch Salad Supreme Seasoning for a few months now.  It has become our go-to seasoning for many things including popcorn!  The small 2.
4436;Good product, price not so hot;If you cannot find this on the grocery shelf, this is a good source.  At $1.
4437;95% of cups brew very weak;Extremely disappointed in the quality of this brand's brewing quality.  Will not order this particular brand again.
4438;illy fan is loving this blend in our home machine;"As my wife and I found we had become ""those people"" who stop at the local coffee shop many times a week, we needed to hit the lotto, quit or buy a machine and learn to make our own go-juice.<br /><br />This coffee brews wonderfully in our new DeLonghi Bar32 (EC155 clone) - the fine grind makes the cheezy built-in tamper more than good enough, reducing counter-clutter."
4439;Oh how I love these.;I've lost the ability to limit myself and identify what a normal portion looks like, so these 100 calorie snack packs are great. My favorite way to eat these little gems is sprinkled over vanilla yogurt or vanilla pudding.
4440;Excellent product!;I've taken magnesium for years, quality brands, and know it is helpful for my health problems.  I just tried this brand this time and was amazed at how quickly after drinking it I felt very calm and relaxed.
4441;Received wrong item;When I received the product it was regular coffee vs decaf.  Amazon refunded my purchase price and told me to keep the coffee.
4442;Great service!;I love this lemon ginger tea. It has a rich flavor.
4443;My dog's favorite bone!;I purchased this bone for my dog last Christmas and it is still one of her favorites! I believe we got the 'brontosaurus' model. She is an Australian Shepherd (about 35 lbs) and is extremely rough on her toys.
4444;TERRIFIC NATURAL FORTIFIED JUICE;My family loves this product.<br /><br />My wife likes the small compactness, it's easy not only easy to carry but satisfying in flavor and the handy 8 oz amount.
4445;McCann's Irish Oatmeal;Great product and worth the extra money.  McCann's steel cut oatmeal gives you energy longer than typical oatmeal on the market.
4446;Kitty Love;Rain and cold weather go hand in hand, especially because they make our pets go crazy. When it's cold out, the cats can't decide whether they want to go in or out and every time the dogs come in from outside, they're hyped up and full of energy.
4447;Jet Fuel coffee;Dark roast with no bitterness. My husband likes Jet Fuel as his daily coffee.
4448;Probably loved by babies...;The short version:  These would probably be fine and palatable to a baby/toddler.  If you are looking for food for an older kid with eating issues/food aversions/texture issues etc.
4449;Tastes like MOLD;This is awful. It tastes like mold.
4450;Don't buy these;Do not buy these if you don't have the self-discipline of a nun.  They are my favorite snack of all time.
4451;Excellent Value for the money;I have found this to be an excellennt value for the money.Purchasing this excellent full bodied coffee in bulk is a great way to save money over the full retail costs in the grocery store.
4452;So far...;I've noticed little reaction from using this tea.  Having used detox in the past, there were certain things I expected, even in a mild form, that never showed, so I am honestly unsure of any detoxing qualities of the tea.
4453;Officially the worst.;Simply terrible.  Awful.
4454;Great Flavor Coffee!;My wife and I really love the flavor and have been ordering them from Amazon for quite some time. I can't give the coffee a bad review, love it but the description does say 50 k-cups.
4455;Much Love for it;I am using a Senseo machine so this was a nice product to use it with.<br />The box is large and has a slot you can open at the bottom to get one bag at a time, like a dispenser.
4456;DELISH!!! Love this spread any time of the day!;I love this spread..
4457;Favorite Torani flavor;We've tried several flavors and this is my family's favorite. I thought the French Vanilla flavor tasted artificial but this just tasted like clean vanilla.
4458;Carolina Rice is the best.;We retired from NY to Fl. What do we miss the most? Carolina Rice! :-) Can't find it in our local stores.
4459;FEELS LIKE OLD TIMES!!!!! I LOVE THESE CANDIES!!!;I used to buy these candies when I was young, I was like 8. I remember this ice cream man would come around by my house, and I would buy a whoooole bunch to last me forever!! LOL But finally i found them for cheap on AMAZON and had to buy them! Finally I received my box of Sour Power Strawberry Belts and now I'm sharing them with my 4 year old son.
4460;Nummy Granola Bar;This is a really nummy and nutty bar with chocolate goodness.  The best granola bar that I have had and nowhere near the fat/sugar of a candy bar.
4461;***WARNING!***;WARNING! THIS ITEM CONTAINS MONOSODIUM GLUTAMATE (MSG). ACTUAL ONION POWDER IS THE SECOND TO LAST INGREDIENT.
4462;Great product!;I bought two of those to freeze food for my baby and they are great.  The food pops out pretty easily.
4463;Natural cider in a k cup;I was impressed with this cider. Originally skeptical of apple cider in a k cup, this really doesn't disappoint.
4464;Sheet dimensions?;I don't see the size of these parchment sheets anywhere
4465;Rawhide Bone Pack;This is the exact pack of bones that I buy at Sams Club.I love this type of bone as it does not crack and splinter as some rawhides  do that can hurt my dog.
4466;Breakfast Blend for my Keurig;The Green Mountain Breakfast Blend provides a perfect start for my mornings.  I do not like the strong robust blends that many prefer.
4467;Lavender Honey;I was surprised how much I dislike the flavor of lavender honey. The lavender smells lovely but adds a bitter, acrid, unpleasant taste.
4468;Bibi;A traditional tea with a sweet twist.  A hint of Indian  flavors tha t transport you to far away lands.
4469;Green Chai Tea;My husband loves this tea.  He drinks it for the antioxidant contents.
4470;Cinnamon Roll;This Larabar tastes just like a cinnamon roll!!!  I don't know how those Larabar people do it, but whatever the flavor of Larabar it is, it tastes just like the real thing!!!  This particular Larabar is cinnamon roll, therefore, it goes good with a cup of coffee.  And in this cold weather lately, good hot coffee has been welcome!!!  I've been having my share lately of good hot coffee and Larabars!!!  And if you like cinnamon rolls, I'm sure you would love this particular Larabar.
4471;Very nearly perfect;Of all the ramen I've ever had, this is my favorite instant brand. Annie Chun ramen is all natural, with no MSG (which great, because I'm sensitive to MSG but love ramen).
4472;Great;I was excited to see these on Amazon. My kids love these fruit ropes & I have a hard time finding them in the store.
4473;It is better than I expected;I really recommend this product. It is well packaged and protected.
4474;My Opinion? Doesn't taste great;I don't want to say that this is a bad product, because some people may enjoy this. Since it was fruit, I was expecting a taste more sweet than it is.
4475;Great and handy;Before my purchase (from a local store, not Amazon), I had my doubts about this expensive product, but as someone who was just starting to make baby food for an 8.5 month-old who was not too keen on the chunkier textures, and since I didn't want to feed him the stage 3 store jars with meat in them, I needed to know that I was doing it right (steamed enough, etc), and this practical item did the trick.
4476;Tasty, Tasty Granola;This granola is very good.  It's not very sweet and has a nice crunch.
4477;Good Buffalo Jerkey but wierd shape...;Although I've had better buffalo jerkey this stuff is pretty good.  My only issue is that the jerkey is processed into a flat disc of meat.
4478;Good product;As the licorice goes this is pretty good stuff. If you haven't tried this one and are debateing it, give it a shot.
4479;Very Good Latte;I really liked this latte and the price was right, but my favorite store starting stocking it, so I switched from Amazon..
4480;Did you eat my food?;My review is primarily based upon the shipper. When I received the package, the top had already been torn completely off.
4481;Pretty good.;These are pretty good. In my opinion, they aren't nearly as good as the Teriyaki Beef Steak Nuggets (which are sort of similar), but they aren't bad either.
4482;Blueberries?;No blueberries to be found, they use blueberry concentrate to create a skittle like nodule.  Not any blueberry flavor.
4483;Tastes Great & I love the size...;I am very picky about flavors of water.  There's only about 2-3 out there that I care for.
4484;Too weak;I was recently introduced to Puerh tea by a friend of mine who shared it with me in the form of a tea brick - it had an incredibly bold taste and was so dark it looked like black coffee. When I purchased this Numi tea I was hoping for the same boldness of the Puerh tea that I had in brick form - unfortunately - even with two teabags in a mug - the flavor wasn't nearly as strong as I was expecting.
4485;No Better Taste, Worse Nutrition Than Local Brands, Higher Price;It gets one star for the price, fat and salt content and because it's 3.65 oz.
4486;Excellent;The best K-Cups I have tried so far.  Others have said they like Newman's Own, but that this Starbucks Dark French Roast is better and I have to agree.
4487;lower-salt, but still salty;This is 650mg/salt/tsp. which is slightly lower than 850mg/salt/tsp.
4488;Delicious!;"I loved the <a href=""http://www.amazon."
4489;great tasting product, but.......;Glenny's soy crisps with olive oil,garlic & feta chese is good tasting!!!<br /><br />But people with hypertention will proberbly have increased numbers..
4490;Great price for an amazing product;I bought a few of these both for my personal use and for Halloween and every single one I have eaten has been fresh and delicious.  I also expected for a lot of them to be broken but only like 1 or 2 out of all the bags I have opened have been like that.
4491;Good product;These two-pound bags appear fresher than the 1 pound boxes I was buying at the local Vons grocery store. They are clean, not moldy.
4492;Excellent beans, great taste!;We've been ordering Raven's Brew coffee for years from their website.  The coffee is expensive but worth it!  The quality is excellent and the beans are always incredibly fresh.
4493;Yummy;Get them on sale if you can..
4494;ok;Not as good as everyone is raving about, although its good, i wont be buying another full case. It is a little on the spicy side, but if you add 8 oz.
4495;He loves sweet potatos, but this one is runny;I don't know if its the corn, but this sweet potato is runny.  The other ones from Gerber with sweet potato's are not.
4496;amazing value price.;I have 2 small dogs, that absolutely love greenies, In stores such as pets mart or pet co they want $35+ on sale for a pack this large. I always order on amazon.
4497;Great sugar substitute!;This product is great. It tastes just like sugar and has no strange after taste.
4498;Great Taste!;I honestly was scared of ordering this as some of the reviews are less than positive about the taste but seriously, it is good! If you are already a vegetarian or if veggies are a primary part of your daily diet you will have no problem with the taste, it's like eating sweet fresh grass. It is gritty but it doesn't bother me at all.
4499;Simple, time-saving, and delicious;This is one of our favorite weeknight meals.  It is so simple to prepare, you can throw all ingredients in one pot (I don't like doing dishes), and most importantly, it's delicious and makes a healthy meal.
4500;Delicious mix, good sell by date;This mix is wonderful, and it doesn't expire until 2011, not that it will last anywhere near that long in my house.<br /><br />I've made it twice already, and the second time I added some almond meal just for fun (I didn't measure- but it was between 1/3 and 1/2 cup), since it was so good when I added it to the Garvey's scone mix.
4501;Best. Gummi. Bears.;I've tried all kinds of gummi bear brands through the years.  Black Forest, Trolli, you name it I've likely had it.
4502;Review for Quaker oatmeal squares, cinnamon flavor;This cereal reminds me of frosted mini wheats. When eaten without milk, it is not too sweet but is still sweet enough to avoid being bland.
4503;More bang for my buck!Q;Since we've had a keurig, we've gone through many varieties of kcup coffees including flavored and non flavored. Every kcup seemed to be either weak, bitter, acidic, or just ordinary.
4504;Delicious;This is roughly a two month supply of breakfast for a single person who eats oatmeal every morning..
4505;Hands down the best GF flour available!;My poor husband has celiac but has the worst sweet tooth ever. i use this flour for any sweet treat i make him.
4506;Bad for you!;The mango is not like in the picture - the mango I received is bright orange in color from food dyes (listed in the ingredients list on the package) and it also contains sulfur dioxide which is known to be a carcinogen. It made my mouth feel funny and my tongue went bright yellow.
4507;Wonderful Chew Treat!;This is the only digestable chew treat that our 7 lb. Yorkie can tolerate.
4508;Nice Little Treat, but...;The Zuke's Mini Naturals is great for training and while on walks, however, this treat will dry out fast and become very hard. My mini schnauzer will refuse the treat when it is no longer moist.
4509;Best Margarita Mix Out There;I've tried a lot of mixes and this is the best by far.  On top of the taste, the convenience can't be beat.
4510;My Kids Devour These Cookies;"""Oreos"" are America's favorite cookie. Frankly, I've never understood the fascination."
4511;Crunchy and Sweet;I am following a low carb way of eating and was looking for a protein bar that didn't remind me of a tootsie roll.  This is nice and crunchy, but a little too sweet for my taste.
4512;In sufficient product information;On the Amazon page, the product information contains only the brand name and the quantity. For the sake of those who may be allergic to wheat (rather than suffering from celiac disease), the contents of the mixes should be listed.
4513;Enough to stand out among a sea of nutrition bars?;It seems like another new type of nutrition bar, energy bar, or diet bar pops up every week.  I can't even count the number of brands, let alone varieties.
4514;GOOD BUY;Per ounce this Extra Virgib Olive Oil with natural Garlic costs less than grocery store offerings of Garlic Oil. Some of these are frequently other oils and chemically flavored garlic.
4515;Worst tasting Celsius product ever, by far!;I have had about 9 flavours of Celsius products, which I believe is all of them.<br /><br />My ranking (Best to Worst) based on my preference:<br /><br />Sparkling Ginger Ale<br />Green Tea Peach Mango<br />Strawberry Kiwi<br />Iced Lemon Tea<br />Sparkling Wild Berry<br />Sparkling Orange<br />Sparkling Cola<br />Green Tea Raspberry Acai<br />Apple Orchard (Stevia)<br /><br />The Ginger Ale, Green Tea Peach mango, and Strawberry Kiwi are top notch to me, very tasty!  Everything up to the Cola is really good in my opinion.
4516;Loved these!;This collector's Presidential Pez set was just what I needed to add to a library display I was creating regarding the US Constitution.  Fun and unusual and almost everyone remembers the fun of getting a Pez candy character as a kid.
4517;Total waste of money;I bought 2 of these balls for my black lab mixed mutts. They had the treats popped out of the balls in less than 5 mins, we kept putting them back in but 30 seconds later they had them out again.
4518;excellent;These wraps are an excellent alternative to regular bread.  They are light and healthy, and very tasty.
4519;Best Flavored Tea;This is the best flavored tea I have tasted.  It is so smooth like drinking hot chocolate, because it is decafinated I use a regular tea bag with it and sweet and low.
4520;My cats will do anything for this product.;All I have to do is rattle the package and all 3 of my cats come running. Everything from going to the vet to clipping their claws is so much easier with Whisker Lickins as a treat reward.
4521;One of the best dog foods;This is a very healthy dog food.  There are no by-products in this food.
4522;Excellent Snack Food;These things are great. Perfect size bag for an afternoon snack.
4523;Simply the BEST!;Proceed with Caution!  Unless you are prepared to become addicted, avoid these unbelievably delicious truffles!  They will change your life, not to mention, probably seeing the scale move upward!  There are some simple, beautiful delights that are worth the change.  Without a doubt, these delicacies are truly one of them! Lightly powdered with cocoa and the smoothest of non-bitter dark chocolate you bite into is pure bliss.
4524;Not fresh;I was very disappointed with this tea, it didn't taste fresh.  It was not delivered in an air tight container and the leaves have very low fragrance and the brewed tea has a poor weak taste.
4525;yuck;This was the nastiest flavored coffee I have ever had in kcups. I purchase many different kinds of flavored coffee and caramel is my favorite but this one made me gag.
4526;Unremarkable;First, let me say that I prefer extra-bold K-Cup coffees and only occasionally drink a medium blend, and never decaf. I bought three Wolfgang Puck coffees several months ago: Rodeo Drive Blend
4527;Nestle Hot Cocoa Mix;I purchased this pack of 4 because the size is perfect for my husband to take to work. He loves this brand of cocoa with the rich milk chocolate taste.
4528;No soda!;Lipton Diet is a super alternate to carbonated drinks..
4529;Gooood;Tastes great, might be filling, oh well.<br />Great product, shipped on time, arrived in perfect condition.
4530;A real taste of Ireland;This mix comes closest to the brown bread one eats in Ireland--not the gourmet stuff from the trendy bakeries, but the bread baked at home.  It is easy, requires only one additional ingredient, and freezes well.
4531;It tastes like water...;And that is pretty awesome.  It is silky smooth and rests well on my palate.
4532;the best tea ever... freah bright clean;this has to be one of the best teas I have ever tasted..
4533;HOTHOTHOTHOTHOTHOTHOT;This hot sauce is no joke.  I've loved spicy food since before I could walk, and can't remember ever eating anything half as potent as this sauce.
4534;Ok taste, no noticible energy boost;Well, there's this. No Fear energy drink.
4535;YUM!;No, these do not taste exactly like potato chips, they taste kind of like diet-food.  But not in a bad way.
4536;Fantastic for meals on the go!;I'm a landscape architect and at any given moment, I can end up in one of three neighboring states working on jobs. Eating out is EXPENSIVE and after you've had a month of home-made sandwiches, even the Earl of Sandwich can no longer entice me to chomp down on one.
4537;High Fructose Corn Syrup;"High fructose corn syrup costs a few cents less per gallon than real sugar, so that's the sweetener they use here. The good news is they offer ""Simply Heinz,"" which is made with real sugar."
4538;Good coffee;I made some for my girlfriend, roommate, aunt, uncles, and some friends. They all really liked it.
4539;too big;I bought these to clicker train my cat.  The treats are too big.
4540;Great old fashioned, tiny chiclets...love them...high price;These are great, fresh, and just as I remember them.  I knew how many I was getting when I ordered them but the price is just too high, no matter what.
4541;Great aroma and flavor.;The flavor is very smooth but the chocolate flavor comes through nicely. I really enjoyed having a cup when my chocolate craving kicked in while I was dieting.
4542;GREAT DEAL!;For the money this has been the best wine kit I have ever bought. I have been making wine for years and I have paid a lot.
4543;SO/SO;If you have been to France and had their Wild Strawberry jam and know how amazing it is-this product might disappoint. It is still a decent product, but I have found better in Dean and DeLuca (granted that jam was $17).
4544;Satisfied Taster;I love salt & vinegar chips and I love Blue Diamond almonds so I was delighted to find a combination of the two.  They make a great snack and a great substitute for chips with a sandwich.
4545;Tastes Good!...;I really liked this product, though it did take a couple uses to get it just right. I've found that a little definitely goes a long way.
4546;Didn't find it all that jazzy.;I have to admit that when I first tried this one I wasn't crazy about it.  It seemed lacking in flavor and richness to me compared to Green Mountain French Roast decaff, which is my favorite.
4547;nice ones;hmm..
4548;Cat Likes Better Than Newman's Turkey Formula;Pros:<br />-Good first 5 ingredients: Organic Chicken, Water, Chicken Liver, Salmon, Ocean Whitefish<br />-My cat likes it better than Newman's Turkey and Vegetables formula<br /><br />Cons:<br />-Expensive (but organic)<br />-A top pick for my cat, but noticeably not as much as her favorite: Natural Balance (similar top 5 ingredients: Chicken, [Water], Chicken Liver, Duck, Salmon)<br /><br />So in the organic category, this is a 5-star pick. But if you're willing to go non-organic consider Natural Balance.
4549;Two paws down;My ten pound Yorkie is very food centric when it comes to games - if there isn't food, he isn't playing.  We have several bumble balls and kongs that he loves to play with and thought this treat wheel would be a fun new game for him.
4550;good - but for shame amazon;I love all the Horizon milk - but this one.  I won't give a bad rating because it's just my personal taste.
4551;great device but cleanup can be tedious;i bought this device over the brezza because the brezza, while able to steam and blend for you, seemed to have a lot of quality control issues.  i didn't want to order the brezza and and have to return it because i got a lemon.
4552;Good Refreshing Pick-Me-Ups;I might as well review both Illy issimo Caffe Coffee Drink  & Illy issimo Cappuccino Coffee Drink at the same time, since essentially the only difference is the additional lowfat milk and cocoa in the cappuccino.  I am not a daily addict of high end espresso drinks, but I do have both espresso & cappuccino now and then - often Starbucks, but not exclusively.
4553;SLIME :-(;"I was hoping for a ""dried"" plum.."
4554;Good taste - poor packaging;The good news - the cookies are tasty and fresh. The bad news - the most current packaging (summer 2010) means the contents are powder by the time they reach you.
4555;OK--but not good value or extrodinary taste;Item arrived after at very end of allotted shipping timeframe.  Product's unremarkable plastic bottles were packed in a twin-pak box that required considerably larger exterior packaging for secure delivery.
4556;Very tasty, makes good Mochas too;I ordered this hot cocoa on the basis of several good reviews on Amazon, and I'll add my own to that stack.  The cocoa is very tasty by itself.
4557;SO CHEWY GREAT FLAVORS;I heard about this bars on QVC thought I could get a better price on Amazon & I did.  These taste so good, I like that they are all natural, they are so chewy.
4558;Amazon is the best;This is the coffee I like about the best but Amazon is amazing. I was looking for the 120 pack at the best price and I figure this was mispriced (way low) So I orderd it figuring I would get an e mail saying no way! Well it is Amazon ,they honored the order at the advertised rate,caught the glitch and corrected the price.
4559;Great cereal without all the sugar;For those looking for a raisin bran without alot of sugar. This is a product to consider.
4560;These are yummy!;These are so good. I bought them to make some cookies for my son who cannot eat dairy or gluten.
4561;super good;I think this milk is great. I have a 3 yr old granddaugter that is allergic to milk.
4562;Overwhelming lemon;This flavor was included in a variety pack we received with our new Kuerig and I was very excited to see I could make iced tea. This flavor has an overwhelming lemon flavor and bitter after taste.
4563;Mmmmm peanut butter;I've had these and there very good. Look forward to having them as a snack.
4564;Delicious and soothing;I first tried this tea 4 years ago when a friend introduced it to me at work.  I was able to buy it at Trader Joes but they discontinued stocking it in my local store about a year ago.
4565;My girlfriend keeps drinking all of it!;I drink at least two cups of tea a day and have tried hundreds of types.  After years of drinking black I have switched to green and white and now I would not go back.
4566;Good. Hotter than I thought it would be. Slight canned tomato edge to it;I like this sauce.  It goes well with shrimp, chicken, green peas, potatoes, cauliflower and probably a lot of other things including chick peas.
4567;Great for baby!!;I bought these on a whim while shopping at Babies R Us a few weeks back and my daughter (who was 6 months at the time, now 7 months) loves them! When we were running low I made sure to stock up this time! I love that they're organic and easy for my baby to chew. There IS sugar in these though.
4568;Weak On Vanilla Flavor, not worth the price;I enjoy a flavored coffee occasionally.Jean's French Vanilla Supreme, lacks largely in Aroma and Flavor, nill or none of either.
4569;A wonderful introduction to flavoured matcha!;It took me a long time to finally place an order for some Red Leaf Tea matcha, and now that I have it in my hands (and my tummy!) I wish I had have purchased it sooner.<br /><br />I was unsure whether I would find it too much of a fuss to prepare matcha myself, or whether I would enjoy the delicious sweet grassy taste of matcha paired with rich flavourings.
4570;Love it!;We found this on a Princess cruise ship, the Golden, on our honeymoon.  It's flavor is almost a little minty, definitely distinctive.
4571;Very good tortilla chips;The taste of these is right between Tostitos Multigrain chips and Original Sun Chips, and that's pretty nice place to be. A little sweeter corn flavor then the Tostitos, but not as much as the Sun Chips.
4572;Cesar;Genuine Cesar dog food at a great price.  They pack them great.
4573;AJ;This is exactly what I was hoping for. A bunch of good licorice.
4574;Satisfies your candy bar cravings without the calories;Yummy.  Just enough chocolate and peanut butter to feel like a treat.
4575;After taste not that good;The machine empties the k cup, it's dry contents.  Not all that good, watery even on the low setting of hot water.
4576;There are better choices out there;This cereal is masquerading as healthy.  Yes, it is organic and gluten-free, but it also is a processed food containing a fair amount of sugar at 7g per serving (second ingredient is organic evaporated cane juice) and gets its fiber from added inulin (and maybe additional sweetening from this ingredient), rather than just from whole grains.
4577;Misses the mark with...TITANIUM DIOXIDE;The ingredients look great EXCEPT for the titanium dioxide.  Why do I need the colorant when I am putting it in my mouth.
4578;worst feeling ever!;"I decided to try 5 hour energy after it was recommended to me by my Dad. I have been drinking ""Go Girls"" for a while and I loved them."
4579;Very tasty bread mix;This mix makes a very tasty bread, I made it my breadmaker and it came out great.  The only thing is I think its made for a smaller breadmaker, the loaf was only about 2/3rds the size of other mixes I use.
4580;A guest favorite;I can't think of anything bad to say about this coffee. Every guest we have had enjoys it.
4581;Very fast service.;I love this product but it is almost impossible to get it. I was thrilled when I found it here.
4582;Great Coffee, Terrible Price!;Found these at Bed, Bath and Beyond for [..
4583;Definitely a good breakfast indeed!;Not too bold, not too weak..
4584;Perfect for wiggly little boys;My son hates being sprayed (bug or sunscreen spray). He spends most of his day outside at daycare and mosquitoes find him very sweet.
4585;Meh...;With all the good reviews and an Amazon coupon I purchased this and the enchilada soup mix both to try and give as small Christmas gifts.  Cooked it in the crock-pot today with some veggie fake chicken strips and the flavor and vegetables really did nothing.
4586;Turmeric;This product is amazing and has a good quality. I have been using it for cooking and to prepare my own curry and it tastes wonderful.
4587;Excellent quality;This is a high quality tea.  You can instantly tell the difference between this Earl Grey and the other more commons ones you find in the grocery store.
4588;Great work and on the go tea;I am a big fan of drinking tea, and love a good earl grey.  This is one of the best earl greys you can get, unless you upgrade to the loose leaf teas.
4589;Too Small for Us Now;It was a five star for me, but I don't know that it will be for others.<br /><br />My rescue White Husky/Samoyed mix, Hope, absolutely LOVES these treats.
4590;As good as homemade;Don't be put off by the cartoon label: this is SERIOUS, EXCELLENT pizza sauce, the best I've ever tasted out of a can. My family has been eating it for years.
4591;Delicious candy from childhood!;I've loved these mints since I was a kid, and it's just about impossible to find them in stores.  I couldn't believe it when I saw them on Amazon.
4592;Great price on quility pig ears;A box of 100 all large pig ears for you pet. None with a lot of fatty left over.
4593;pretty good for the price;In a past life, I was a bit of a coffee snob. For the foreseeable future, however, I'm on a tight budget that makes keeping stocked up with expensive coffees for daily drinking just not tenable.
4594;Yum!  Rich, strong, and not bitter.;Bought this during one of Amazon's Friday Sales.  Did not find too many reviews since these are fairly new.
4595;Disappointed;I thought for sure I was going to love this tea. I love licorice and I like my teas sweet.
4596;Best ... chips ... ever;Hands down, there isn't a tortilla chip that I crave more.  Exactly enough heat to be interesting, but not overwhelming.
4597;Not the best Trident layers flavor but amazing!!!;For a sugarless gum this guy is great! I don't like my gum to last so long that my jaw is gonna stiffin up and this lasts just long enough and unlike vitality i can feel the gum in my mouth when i chew it. Even though vitality is also a great gum.
4598;Short Changed;When you pay for 50 K-Cups you expect to receive 50 not 42.  The K-cups are expensive enough already.
4599;Navitas nuturals Goji berries;Good produces, Good service. Goji berries is very good for antioxident and healty.
4600;Hormel chicken;Great to have on hand as I can not always get  to the store.<br />Use for casseroles and other dishes.
4601;high quality food;great food! my dogs have smaller stool and great coats! the ingredients are all high quality and the first one is chicken. highly recommend food.
4602;Best Iced K-Cup I've Had!;This coffee has a very tropical taste to it, so it's perfect for iced coffee on a hot day.  The flavor is not bad when heated, but it just seems a little odd.
4603;Bad taste and burn;I've had hemp seeds before, purchased at my local natural foods market (navitas brand, I believe) and enjoyed it very much.  In contrast, Nutiva in the 5 lb bag, was disappointing to say the least.
4604;Stanley wants seconds!;Stanley may not be the best source for food reviews, since he generally eats anything he can fit into his mouth and seems to enjoy it, but the fact is, he is very fussy about dog food.  I've tried the high priced stuff, Royal Kanin, Iams, even Paul Newman's offering which smells better than the stuff I feed myself.
4605;Wonderful coffee;Love this coffee, but cannot buy it through regular outlets, so am gouged by SASA Corner. Really sticks in my craw paying more than a buck a cup.
4606;Weight Watcher Friendly Chips;These chips are very good and are only 2 points a serving per Weight Watcher points calculator.  I like the Barbeque Popchips best and having them in a single serve bag prevents me from eating more than a 0.
4607;Cat loves this and the turkey & giblets!;My cat loves this one and the turkey & giblets(dark purple). The cups are great, much easier and much safer than cans in my opinion.
4608;Low Sodium Soup - Yummy tasting;I don't care for most brands of the low sodium soups.  I do like Campbells Low Sodium Chicken Broth though.
4609;Fun;I first bought these jelly beans in a local store, my boys 9 (8 and 14) had so much fun with it I had to find it again and buy it, this time for my 18 year old niece who chain reads the Harry Potter books (and loves jelly beans). Some of the beans are delicious (lemon drop, cherry, cinnamon, blueberry, toasted marshmallow etc  but I didn't dare to try the unconventional ones.
4610;Great instant rice;As I have never tried instant rice before this, I was pleasantly surprised. The rice has long shelf life and is quick to heat up to eat.
4611;3 out of 4 Paws;First Impression: Old Mother Hubbard Dog Biscuits are a great treat for the value and are made with wholesome ingredients. A large bag of the small biscuits lasts for weeks.
4612;Not my favorite flavored coffee;I'm not sure why, but I do not like this as much as some other flavored coffees.  The flavor is very  noticeable, but it does not remind me of vanilla the way I would like.
4613;So much flavor your farts will smell like sweet onions;These chips taste awesome. And unlike most other flavored chips, they actually make sure that plenty of the flavory salty goodness gets on each individual chip.
4614;THE BEST FLAVOR;This is my top favorite hot sauce.  I use this on my breakfast.
4615;Great Espresso Coffee;Gaggia Classic and Capresso Grinder - After brewing a couple of bags of Lavazza Super Crema Espresso, I thought that I would try the Coffee Bean Direct Italian Roast Expresso since the reviews were good and the price per pound was lower.  I tried a couple of different grinds however ended up with my grinder set at just into the extra fine range.
4616;Kind Plus Bars;The Kind Plus is high in protein, nutritious and tasty.  Its a dessert for us.
4617;Great Stuff!;I have been having problems with my bladder. Interstital Cystitis is a chronic condition and also effects the colon.
4618;Helped my dog loses weight;I have two basset hounds and they tend to have weight problem especially since they have a mommy that dooesn't like to see them go hungry.  I feel good giving my babies this food because this company has a good reputation and they are consistently on the many lists of good pet food by independent raters.
4619;Very worth it.;I love that the heavy things come to my door and I don't have to lug them around the grocery. This is good value and great price.
4620;Essentia Water Pretty Good;I enjoyed the taste of this water whether cold from the fridge or room temperature. I did not notice any aftertaste.
4621;My dog loved it!;My dog loved this food and his rashes went away unfortunately it is too rich for him and we found he gained weight. We had to switch his food again for weight management only.
4622;Somewhat unpleasant;When I first opened the can, it smelled musty.  Pu-er is supposed to be still actively aging, so I figured it must be normal.
4623;Not Our Cup of Tea;My husband and I both like wasabi but ..
4624;Green Cardemom 3.5oz;Excellent product. Smells divinely.
4625;Cincinnati Chili At Its Best;Product is true to its name.  The flavor is there.
4626;Really good;I love Roland black truffle cream. I mix it with my porcini/shitake/parma linguine pasta.
4627;so so;I have been looking for a replacement for the Harry and Davids fig Balsamic, which had a soft moderate balsamic flavor.  This product is not very close to that.
4628;fresh and flavorful;I am new to the world of one cup at a time coffee makers and had always scoffed at others who had them.  But I am an enthusiastic convert.
4629;Great for dog, NOT for clean up;My dog does enjoy this bone, as do my parents dogs BUT HELLO, it is NOT low mess.  None of my dogs make this a LOW mess bone.
4630;truly a great product!!;I am constantly getting motion sickness. I've tried everything to help relive me of the nausea that I get whenever I get into a moving vehicle: ginger slices, peppermint tea, sprite.
4631;Excellent grapeseed oil;It's a good replacement for olive oil in sous vide cooking (where the olive oil, cooked at low temperatures for a long time, takes on a metallic, or even bloody, taste). Good quality oil with just a bit more flavor than the (cheaper) Costco grapeseed oil.
4632;Hubby's Best Friends;As a married man, I'm constantly in a state of conflict. Left to my own devices, I'm perfectly content to shovel food, guzzle beer, emit various gasses and generally befoul my surroundings like the coothless savage half-shaven chimp I am.
4633;Sweet!;I love Shirakiku Ramune Soda. The first time I had it was in the Japanese Pavilion in Epcot.
4634;This Was So Gross It Wouldn't Stay Down;I used to purchase a microwaveable Pad Thai by Thai Kitchen at my local grocery store that was a Thai version of cup-o-noodles, edible but not tasty. You had to fill the container with hot water, let sit for a few minutes then drain and stir in freeze-dried veggies and powdered sauce packet.
4635;Great food & great price;If I had only figured out to order baby food online before.  The price is right on the money and the convenience of the shipping to the house is great.
4636;These chips will make you fat;But you will enjoy ever step. I gained 5 lbs within a month of buying this 12 pack of full sized bags.
4637;Don't bother with the tea bags -- go for the full leaf!;Pu-erh is a tricky tea to talk about.  It is part of an ancient tradition of health-giving teas that isn't discussed or researched in the west.
4638;I enjoy Madhava coconut sugar from Amazon;If I use sugar in anything, this is what I use. I love the taste.
4639;Developed problems after couple weeks;I have had my German Shepherd on Canidae (chicken) since she was a puppy and did wonderful. Well, Canidae had a recall last winter & I had to switch her, so I tried Wellness (chicken).
4640;Yay Gluten, Peanut and Soy FREE Yum!;I got these from a local bee keeping specialty store in Sacramento..
4641;twisted fruit;I bought this product and sent it to my daughter that is currently attending college. She was very grateful for the present and said she really likes it.
4642;as good as any other ive ever had;these come in little packages which probably helps keep them fresh longer. i dont know if theres too much dye or sugar or what not, but i dont care, because all you have to do to make it perfect is just soak it in some pure water for a couple of hours.
4643;Rich, sweet corn flavor;In an emergency food situation, I would eat these straight from the jar.  But they aren't as flavorful that way as rehydrated.
4644;Tasty and fairly healthy;On a scale of 0 to 10:<br /><br />Health: 7 - The main ingredient is the standard flour, followed then by the 7 whole grains, so this can't be considered a true whole grain cracker.  The positives are that there are no hydrogenated oils and the limited sweetener is evaporated cane juice.
4645;Hard to digest...;Man, this is hard to believe! You can get this same thing at Sam's Club for $4.88.
4646;great snack;I like to put in my yogurt or hot cereal, it really kicks up the flavor. It's also a great little snack by itself.
4647;Wonderfully Nutty and Delightfully Delicious;This is not the first time I've purchased KIND bars although it is the first time I have ordered this particular flavor combination.  I just love them.
4648;Just what was expected;I have been buying this food locally but began to have a hard time fInding it. I searched online and it was a little more cost effective.
4649;Best wet food!;Nice to know my 15 year old cat is eating healthy organic food (and has done for years) AND he is crazy about the taste. He is very picky and wont even touch the other flavours.
4650;bleh...;I was not as impressed as the other reviewers.  If you are reading this and are used to freshly ground coffee every morning, please don't buy this.
4651;Great tasting milk;This is really good tasting and you always have an easy way to have milk any time you want it. All you do is add water.
4652;Go great with wine;I've tried at least a half dozen different types of these costini crackers, all bought through Amazon, and these were my favorite. Also got a graet price by sucribing for a once a month delivery.
4653;Made my first stab at Indian cooking a BIG success.;I just made Butter Chicken Curry and it was sooooooo YUMMY!!! I strongly recommend this product. It is so much better than other currys out there on the market.
4654;No worse than most restaurant coffees;I cannot drink caffeine but i wanted to drink coffee so i tried this product.  This coffee was no worse than most restaurant coffees.
4655;These are very sweet;As cereals go they are not the surgery-est, but they are a very sweet cereal. The closest other cereal I thought this tasted like was frosted flakes.
4656;Herbox;Herbox sodium-free beef broth is a great product.  It allows me to add meat flavor to my vegetable soups without causing my blood pressure to go up.
4657;FINALLY kicked my soda habit!;I love this product.  I wanted to stop drinking soda, and I don't care for coffee, but I still needed caffeine to make it through the day.
4658;Yuck;This meatloaf is Terrible. Smells bad and has a chemical taste, other types like the chili and pasta is good , THIS IS TERRIBLE.
4659;Good but not great;I was hoping these would be nice and tart like the ocean-spray craisins. They aren't.
4660;super yummy crunchy;These were surprisingly delicious. Excellent texture, like a hearty tortilla chip, yet very crisp.
4661;Great Stuff;Works great and as described, really helps when you have a lot to do. Similar to Red Bull.
4662;excellent source fair price;Despite a promise of delivery in about 12 days, the product arrived in less than half that time.  Perfect timing since we were leaving for a trip.
4663;Excellent!;I ordered a three-pack of Ghiradelli® Caffe Gourmet Coffee Chocolate Peppermint Light Roast Organic Ground Coffee, which overall took less time than typing the name, and it arrived as promised this afternoon, which was followed immediately by making an excellent pot of it using the single-drip method at the ratio of 1/2 cup of ground coffee to 12-ounces of water at the ideal brewing temperature of 200 degrees Fahrenheit . .
4664;Moderate Relief for Morning Sickness;My mom gave me these ginger candies during my first trimester when I was pregnant with my second baby and I liked them. The taste was pleasant and although they never totally quelled the nausea, they seemed to at least take the edge off the nausea.
4665;Best. Tea. Ever!!;My husband and I love how spicy and sweet this tea is.  It's truly a dessert.
4666;Delicious, Nutritious,  and a Great Buy!;I am in Chia heaven. I have been wanting to try Chia since reading about its versatility and health benefits but I waited, put off by the steep, in-market, price tag.
4667;Great;Great coffee!  I stumble on this product searching for discounted K-cups, the price is good so I gave it a try.  I highly recommend after the first cup.
4668;Best Canned Beans Period;Eden makes the best canned beans there are. They also are one of the very few companies to have BPA free cansv and they are organic (very important).
4669;STALE;Very disappointed to receive a case of food product with a freshness expiration date of only two months after purchase.  It is unrealistic to expect that a case of Jiffy Pop would be used by a single consumer in two months.
4670;A Tried And True Favorite That Stands The Test Of Time;The 25 cent slim jim that has been around for what seems like forever is just as good as ever.  Great bang for your buck.
4671;Great Tuna;I started eating only wild-caught fish a few months ago after learning about the health benefits and higher quality of nutrients found in the fish.  Although slightly more expensive, you definitely get what you pay for.
4672;Holy Cr#p batman!!!;This stuff will peel the pain off of your bathroom wall..
4673;Effective and tasty;"As soon as I take a sip or two I can feel a sort of wash and openness in my lungs.  Definitely causes one to ""breathe easy."
4674;The absolute best coffee brewed at home!;"For at least a full year now, we have been using Senseo Dowe Egberts Dark Roast Coffee Pods, and the Senseo brewing system in our home. As people who appreciate the difference between Good coffee, and the ""average cup of Java"", we feel that the original Senseo ""Dark Roast"" Coffee Pods, make the best cup of coffee possible."
4675;Titan Loves his ZiwiPeak Venison!;This stuff is so worth it, and when you do the math, it's actually a bargain.  More on that later.
4676;May work, but I can't get it down;I tried drinking this tea twice a day, but the taste is not very good so it's really hard.  I am also taking fenugreek twice a day so the combination of the two seems to have increased my milk supply a little bit.
4677;Our favorite gluten/casein free snack bar;We have tried many gluten and casein free products.  This is by far our favorite snack bar.
4678;Mushy, barely smoked and underseasoned;I love smoked canned fish.<br /><br />I eat kippered snacks and sardines quite regularly.
4679;Delicious;I bought this for my husband and he absolutely loves this tea. It's mild with a slightly sweet hint and is delicious iced as well.
4680;ANNEMIEK;This coffee is the best coffee available in the US today. I've served it to 14 other people also, since trying it at my house, have gone out and bought it too.
4681;nice idea but WEAK!;First, I'll give the manufacturer some credit for making a no-additive, sucralose-only product. The problem with this product is: it's just too weak, in flavor that is.
4682;My daughter calls them Pukes...Bring the nose plugs;I applaud the use of natural ingredients but that's where the applause stops..
4683;My Dogs are CRAZY about this treat!;My 18-month Lab/Hound Mix is sometimes so stubborn and even detached, she often refuses to come when she's called. But when I take a chicken piece out from the package, she suddenly changes personality to be the most obedient, loving dog on earth.
4684;Stoked to Review this Coffee!!;I love coffee and just out of curiosity requested to review this product. This product is first class all the way down to the packaging! Not only do you get a carton of coffee pods that taste great, you won't mind displaying this on your counter for all your friends to see either.
4685;Super HerbTea;"I only drink herb tea. I have searched for years for my a tea that tasted like ""real"" tea."
4686;Excellent service;Gimborn Freeze Dried Treats 21 oz Beef Liver is one of my dog's favorite treats, so I was happy to find them in a large size container. I received my order very quickly, and was happy with the service I received.
4687;exceptionaly wonderful;I was not aware of this product in the first place then I stumbeled upon it and just had to give it a try, I am really glad I did. I never imagined how many items I could find and purchase from amazon.
4688;webDogTrainer.com review;This is convenient and your dog will like the taste.  It is a bit expensive and a cheap peanut butter could also do the trick!  Try putting it in the kong and freezing it to make it last even longer.
4689;Best tomato sauce I've ever found in a jar;"This sauce comes in a rather small jar. Compare the size to what is in your pantry before you buy! One jar is ""5 servings""--more like 3-4 servings of pasta for our family."
4690;Delicious Bang 4 Your Buck!;You get a full (American sized) cup of absolutely delicious coffee. You'll be drooling while brewing! The aroma rivals any of the more expensive versions of coffee that I've sampled.
4691;Yum;This was a treat to get..
4692;Great stuff;This is for all the beef jerky lovers out there. If you like jerky this is the best tasting stuff that Ive found anywhere.
4693;bitter and very poor taste;I am used to ordering the nibs and grinding them myself.  The result is the richest chocolate flavore one can imagine!  This on the other hand left a gritty texture in the pudding I made and has a bitter flavor that could not be masked by even major amounts of sugar and very mild hint of chocolate.
4694;Hungry Dog Super Value Pack;Was not particulary impressed with this bag of miscellaneous products. My dogs liked them all, however, I just wasn't particulary impressed.
4695;Addicted to these!!!;"I LOVE these fruit strips. One review said that they were a brown color, ""nothing like the red picture shown""."
4696;Excellent.;I was looking for something tasting better and safer processing than the store brands. I like this so much, I subscribed ordering for it.
4697;Not bad, but a bit salty.;"Still doesn't really compare to genuine ""theater"" popcorn, but not bad overall.  A bit salty, and too many unpopped kernels."
4698;Taste great, very soothing;Being a huge fan of honey, I really like these lozenges. They tasted great and very quickly made my throat feel better.
4699;TRUE MEXICAN/CEYLON CINNAMON!!!;SO HAPPY!!! I ordered Mexican cinnamon from two other vendors and was dissapointed to find they sent me cassia (the type predominantly used in USA & in just about every grocery store). The two are not interchangeable (unless in dire straights).
4700;Hated it ...;Just hated this mac and cheese. So artificial, yuck and made me sick in the stomach.
4701;Great 100 Calorie Treat!!;I loved the original Oreo Cakesters when they first debuted. But, I shied away from eating them on a regular basis because of the high calorie and fat content in each serving.
4702;Flavor not for me.;The quality of the tea is good, but I didn't care for the flavor.  I'm more of a cinnamon girl.
4703;Animal Crackers;"These animal cracker cookies taste the most like the ""other"" kind that I have tried so far.  So much fun to eat with the grandchildren."
4704;Great value for a good quality jerky;Great item to do Sub & Save on so you can keep a healthy snack on hand for work, school or just at home. Teriyaki is my personal favorite.
4705;Delicious;A quick, easy and delicious option for dinner. Slice it up, cover in sauce and sliced mozzarella, put into a 350 degree oven until bubbly.
4706;Contains BHT;Butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT), also known as butylhydroxytoluene, is a lipophilic (fat-soluble) organic compound that is primarily used as an antioxidant food additive (E number E321) as well as an antioxidant additive in cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, jet fuels, rubber, petroleum products, electrical transformer oil, and embalming fluid.<br /><br />It's a super preservative that companies use.
4707;Tastes great for something so healthy;I bought this as part of my quest for adding healthy but tasty things to my diet.  More fruit is always good, except for the sugars of course, and I've read that cherries may help relieve muscle aches and prevent gout.
4708;Some of the best gum I have bought;I don't usually write gum reviews, but this gum is great. I have tried many different brands, trident, stride, orbit ect and this gum hands down is better quality.
4709;Zero calories but....more filling than regular pasta!;I am SOOOOOOOO happy to have found these noodles!!! I've been calorie counting and these noodles have allowed me to more easily stay in my 1200 calorie daily limit..
4710;It's good;This is obviously one of those products where it's all about personal tastes. I was getting caramel lattes/fraps at Starbucks and Dunkin Donuts and was tired of paying for the high price.
4711;Very good pudding cake!;This is actually a mix for chocolate pudding cake. You only have to add water and bake.
4712;Great for IBD;These bars are terrific for anyone who has IBD issues. My son has crohns and these are a life saver.
4713;Not a miracle product;This product is interesting. It is not a miracle product.
4714;Vegan Natural [Organic Corn] Kosher Choice;Vegan. Natural.
4715;good tea;The tea is good and fresh. We enjoy it.
4716;Lemon Lime - or nasty medicine?;I did NOT like this lemon lime flavor.  It made me gag.
4717;Very tasty;This is my favorite of the 3 or 4 blends offered by emerald. Can only seem to find it at Amazon, since the local grocers seem to sell out of it right away or do not carry it.
4718;Favorite treat;These are my four dogs, two Pomeranians, two Shelties, absolute favorite treats. As soon as I go for the bag they dance around my legs with excitment and I can feel good that they are getting a healthy treat.
4719;Yummy;This is my second purchase of The Pod World Blend Decaf. The flavor is good, and the pod is not only biodegradable, but I put them in my worm composter and the end up nourishing my plants.
4720;Amazing;I love salted and smoked almonds. I had never even heard of Butter Toffee almonds before.
4721;Delicious, yet not too sweet;This product is wonderful!  A nice change of pace for those wanting a nice cookie that is tasty, yet not too sweet. It is nice and flavorful, and makes a perfect afternoon or early evening snack with a hot beverage or a cold glass of milk.
4722;I dont even like bananas but these are SOOO YUMMY!;These are so good.  They a different from any banana chips I ever had.
4723;Picture doesn't match product;Picture is of a 10 oz box. Product is a bunch of small plastic bags.
4724;Salt & Pepper Popchips are the BEST!!!;I love this product. I like some of the other flavors, but this one is the very best.
4725;The only place to buy this;This is the only place I could find this peanut butter. It is as good as buying it at the grocery store.
4726;Great tasting coffee;I like the taste of this coffee. Tried the other brands but got stuck on this one, I also like the ECO friendliness of the company.
4727;Vegan Organic Kosher Choice;Vegan. Organic.
4728;Best of the Bunch;Tastes great and full of fiber. The new breakfast of champions.
4729;Great Balance of Chocolate Flavor;I'm usually a strictly black tea drinker - I don't need anything too fancy in the morning. After trying Numi's Chocolate Puerh, it's going to be hard to go back to basics.
4730;Terrific, healthy, portable fruit;I love this product!  I am a diabetic who needed to find a portable, complex-sugar product that I can carry in my purse for those times when my blood sugars were dropping. This is it!  No simple sugars, like corn syrup/dextrose/sugar, added.
4731;Delicious!;All you need to add to it is yogurt. Every time I make it I am asked for the recipe and how do I get them so moist.
4732;Watery;I decided to buy a case based on the mostly good reviews, but turns out to be one of the most watery k-cups I ever had.  This was on the 10oz setting.
4733;Best Nuts Ever;I absolutely love these nuts! I can't find them where I live so I will continue to order these from Amazon. They are well worth the price.
4734;Great Tea - Totally!;"I love this tea!  I especially use it for a non-caffeine iced tea all summer long.  It has the best ""tea"" flavor, and lends itself well to additional flavors."
4735;Celery Leaf and Stalk;The celery leaf and stalks dried, contain a wonderful flavor.  I use this product in meatloaf, soups and many other meals.
4736;This is a wonderful dog toy!;My golden retriever absolutely loves his tug a jug! It gives him a fun challenge while trying to get his food out of there and it keeps him occupied for a while. It is a great design! I want to get another one for him.
4737;They are GINGER SNAPS so they better be spicy!;I like all the gluten free flavors of cookies that Mi-Del makes.  These are a perfect ginger snap.
4738;Great Product;I ordered this product for my father {he's 92}. He cannot have calcium.
4739;Great Product;My spoiled little dog thinks almost all Dog food really sucks. This is just about the only dry food he will even consider eating.
4740;yummy;This works well all round.  My kids really like the taste.
4741;Fantastic butter;I am so glad i started using this butter to cook with, it just makes anything taste great. the flavor is really buttery.
4742;A Healthier Gumbo;I absolutely love a nice, hot steaming bowl of soup once in awhile. Fortunately, Healthy Choice makes a nice arrangement of taste and quality with their soups.
4743;Misty loves this!;This hairball remedy is crunchy and tasty.  At least I know it's crunchy and Misty says that it's tasty.
4744;Not Impressed with the item. Great shipping however.;Shipping was fast and quick so 5 stars to that. I was however disappointed in the olives.
4745;big mistake;This popcorn is not what I expected. I have tried other brands with the same packaging where everything is measured for you, but this one was the worse so far.
4746;Good for Packaged Tortillas;There's not much to say as I know everyone has probably had packaged flour tortillas.<br /><br />I will confirm that these arrived in fresh, good condition, well packaged, and with a distant expiration date.
4747;Oily dilemma...;I have a very hard time finding a moisterizer.  I have a very oily t-zone while the rest of my face is dry to the point of flakey.
4748;This is my brand of tea;I first came across this brand with Starbucks. Since I don't drink much coffee, I had a hard time finding this in the grocery stores.
4749;Go For The Sugar-Free Version;Having enjoyed No Fear's Sugar-Free energy drinks for quite some time now and being offered the Super Energy Supplement via the Vine Program, I decided to give it a shot.  What I got was a can of generic energy drink with the standard generic citrus-like, lightly carbonated taste and a bizarre but brief aftertaste that I can best explain as tasting like the smell of old cigarette ashes.
4750;Gulden's Spicy Brown Mustard;An excellent product that was not available in the NW.  My husband's favorite and he was delighted with his gift.
4751;Not as fresh dated as I get at the Stores and made in Mexico;"I just received 3 Boxes of Kellogs Rasin Bran as a Subscribe and Save purchase.  I like to check the ""Use By Date"" at the stores because it may sit awhile in our pantry before we use it."
4752;Mango Lover;Mango fresh or dried is one of my most favorite fruits. Since fresh is not as available this product substitutes perfectly.
4753;I really like this pilaf;I don't eat much packed food, but I saw a Dr. McDougall's tortilla soup in the health food section of Publix.
4754;Fast Free shipping;I always purchase the powdered goat milk for my baby's formula. Its easier to digest and does not get thrown up like regular formulas.
4755;Excellent Extract;I have been using this rum extract in Eggnog cake for years. It is without a doubt the best for baking.
4756;Prompt delivery;I tried it and didn't care for it much. Has a strange fishy taste and didn't come with instructions.
4757;The cat loves it too.;This is my pets' favorite treat. Three dogs and two cats love this product, and it is a healthy one for my animals.
4758;One cat loves this, one doesn't care.;My big Tuxedo cat loves these no end.  She will do tricks to get them and if offered she will eat them in large quantity.
4759;I love this one!;The aroma of this tea is heavenly.  Very fruity and soothing.
4760;Horrible, Not what I expected;These aren't real k-cups but the knock-off mesh kind. My coffee was filled with grinds.
4761;yummy!!!;"Plum Organics make super tasty ""green"" foods for baby.  I had been having difficulty in getting my daughter to eat anything green (broccoli, peas, spinach, etc."
4762;NO WAY!!!!;I promise that this oil smells like bacon. I just received my order today and opened it to use, I put a small drop in my palm and began to rub them together to apply it to my face and NO WAY.
4763;Dogs love it!;This was recommended by a friend of mines and since I introduced it to my 3 dogs (different breeds), they act like they cannot get enough. I particularly bought this for my boxer as she has many allergies and so far, she seems to be doing fine on it.
4764;Amazing Fruit Snacks!;I absolutely love these, healthy and yummy with an awesome texture. I love fruit snacks, but am kind of particular about them.
4765;The BEST pancake mix I have ever used;Kodiak Cakes Buttermilk & Honey pancake mix is by FAR the best tasting pancake mix I've ever used.  The fact that it is 100% whole grain and all natural is a major bonus.
4766;sweet but tasty;These are tasty pops, and they aren't too large. These things are so good they didn't have a chance, they were grabbed and gone in no time at all.
4767;Bacon, not so much...;This sort of taste like bacon smells (if that makes any sense).  They don't really taste like bacon, but they are still very sweet.
4768;Good Product for skin and hair;I just bought this product because I wanted to try something different on my skin and hair. I like the way it made my skin feel.
4769;Best scones I have had.;I love these scones. I am lucky enough to live near the cafe where they sell these and these scones keep me coming back and because they are so good and easy to make they make great gifts.
4770;Chiplets;My little dog, Lily loves these treats.  I like them because they break easily and since she is a small dog they work out great.
4771;Lingering bad bitter taste;I purchased the peach and raspberry extract for flavoring iced tea. The propylene glycol in it tasted bitter and left an unpleasant taste for 30 minutes.
4772;So Good!!;Ok Funley's keep doing whatever it is you are doing!!!<br /><br />I can't get enough of these treats, thank goodness they are individually wrapped.  My only dilemma is deciding which I love more the caramel, peanut butter or the original.
4773;Healthy and delicious!;If you want a truly healthy, filling snack, you must give these a try, as well as their sisters, the Vanilla Bean Almonds. They are both just lightly sweetened, and fragrant with either the cinnamon or the vanilla, depending on which you choose.
4774;Best wafers available !!;I have not been able to get these in the US since I left Germany 54 years ago,then found them in a Russian Deli in Washington State.I was very happy to be able to order them On Amazon after our return back home.
4775;Just who does not like oreos;nom nom nom. Oreos are just delicious at every age.
4776;IAMS RECALLED FP FORMULA;Iams recalled its FP formula dry dog food on 7/30/10.  However, Amazon was still selling this product as late as 8/3/10.
4777;It's anyones guess;I ordered this product assuming that I would recieve what was pictured. What I got was a generic package with a generic label.
4778;Nice Alternative.;I'm not an avid coffee drinker, but do have the occasional Monster/Rockstar/Starbucks energy coffee type drink.  Pretty rarely, since those tend to screw with my stomach.
4779;The Best!;For use on my espresso machine at home, I've tried various espresso coffees sold on Amazon.  Most have been very good.
4780;Happy Doggy;My 12-year-old Husky goes crazy for these - they are healthy, delicious (apparently), and a great training tool.  They are a little pricey, but worth it for the joy in my dog's face.
4781;Oops - should have read the fine print!;I thought I was paying for 2 bottles or perhaps 3!  Much too expensive for just 1 bottle.  I should have paid closer attention.
4782;Oatmeal deliciousness :);I just discovered this - a little spoonful is great in oatmeal instead of honey. I love the bite of ginger.
4783;New way to get old product;We used to purchase this companies Orange Cappacinno Coffee until they stopped making it.  We have now found that by mixing one can of the Orange coffee with one can of the traditional Cappaccino Coffee we get very close to the original product that we love.
4784;Great for a picky cat;My 15 year old cat is incredibly picky and instead of having to shove down arthritis pills, we first tried pill pockets (good product, my cat was just too smart). I give her a couple (check with vet) a day and she LOVES them.
4785;Yummy, easy, fast!;I wanted to try these peanut noodles because it sounded like they might be easier to make then the other boxed kind we've been using.  Initially I was a bit disappointed because it advised to pour in 1 cup water into noodes and dry mix, microwave 90 seconds, then drain off excess water, then add peanuts and sauce.
4786;Best Kitty Food Money Can Buy!;Layla is extremely picky and has left certain luxury brand wet foods out to waste simply because they were unappetizing to her (How? I don't know!). And yes, she is probably too spoiled =), but I recently adopted her malnourished and hyperthyroid and I have been trying my best to get her on a healthy eating schedule.
4787;Love this coffee for my Keurig;Tried something new with these paper pods. The coffee is great, smells really good and tastes even better.
4788;No arguing with your healthcare people;What a blessing it is to have these natural products to help with things that not just any ole herb can handle.<br />A very fine grind, to make it easy to use, steeping quickly in warm water or alcohol and filling quick and easily.
4789;Great product, better prices elsewhere;This is a fantastic product especially for increasing your protein intake.  Try making a smoothie with milk, a ripe banana, and a serving of the peanut flour.
4790;I dont like Vegan, I dont like Vegan, ok, Maybe I do;I am always looking for decent tasting snacks that will keep me interested in them.  I really appreciate people that are trying to make things that actually taste like food and not cardboard.
4791;Great way to use your own coffee;Great way to use your own coffee rather than buying k-cups.  They are great because you don't have to change out the holding tray and there is no mess, u just toss them like you would a k-kup, no washing out of the filter every time.
4792;Excellent, no junk, dogs love, great price;I researched all the medium priced good quality foods made of lamb and rice and this was the only product that actually had real lamb as the first product followed by lamb meal, then has rice, carrots, peas, eggs, etc.  Only nonfood items are the required minerals to balance diet and taurine and glucosmine.
4793;I'd give Pill Pockets six stars if I could;These pill pockets are fabulous. You can easily mold them tightly around a capsule (or pill) and so administering medication to a dog is a snap.
4794;Perfect for Soup;This is a wonderful pasta for chicken noodle soup.  It holds up well for refrigeration and repeat heating.
4795;Refreshing mints;If you like strong mints you will enjoy these. They are smooth and creamy.
4796;Great stuff!;This works wonderfully in sweet tea and other foods that don't need bulk from sugar.  I was using quite a bit of Splenda each week in tea, and since we have started Atkins we were unhappy with the carbs that the filler was adding.
4797;the best pizza crust mix ever!!!;We have looked far and wide for a gluten free crust. Hands down this is the best we've ever made.
4798;Tasty and good for your dog;My Boston terrier loves these!  They are great Kong toy fillers.  Besides being tasty, they are made in America.
4799;yummy juice!!;My kid just loves this juice. Not sure why many store do not stock this regularly.
4800;Refreshingly tart and perfectly sweet;This drink mix was a refreshing treat.  It was just tart enough and just sweet enough to provide a nice fruity drink.
4801;addicted.;My son has been diagnosed with a severe peanut allergy. I have been researching and shopping for alternatives to peanut butter so that he can have a more normal life growing up.
4802;Good pasta for our Sunday evening tomato sauce;Each Sunday, we cook up a batch of tomato sauce--with ground beef, diced tomaties, a bit of wine, herbs of Provence, garlic, and tomato paste (with a pinch of sugar). One commonw ay of serving this? Over a bed of penne rigate.
4803;WOW! Taste like the real thing.;These jelly beans are small but have a big taste. I found myself laughing because these taste so much like the real thing.
4804;If it looks good, is it good for the cats?;My two traditional striped cats eat mostly dry Science Diet cat food with a few NuCat vitamins added.  They also get Iams canned chicken, turkey, or beef once a day.
4805;good anti-dandruff shampoo;This anti-dandruff shampoo contains Pyrithione Zinc (1.0%), which is the same anti-dandruff ingredient found in Head and Shoulders shampoos.
4806;Tastes really bad;I love miso soup and was shocked that this soup was so bad.  The smell alone was enough to make me want to dump it out.
4807;Cats Like it;I have been feeding my cats dry food that is supposed to be minimally processed. I have found that they have been much healthier.
4808;It was a good try;It is admirable they are baking these things--clearly the manufacturers are trying to do something healthy here and I think they deserve accolades for trying. I don't think it is a bad taste and I don't think it's bitter.
4809;Best item ever;The Chocolate Fudge Think Thin bar is my.favorite flavor.
4810;Delicious;I love these noodles. They are tender and firm.
4811;Great Price for A LOT of jimmies;I used these to make Elmo cupcakes for my sons.  They make great red fur when you cover the frosting with them.
4812;Each 7 ounce package makes a nice meal or two with additional ingredients;Each individual 7-ounce package of Peacock Brown Rice Vermicelli comes with preparation instructions and two simple recipes, and contains enough vermicelli to make meals for up to two people.  I usually combine vermicelli with any two or three of the following: diced pork, shrimp, tofu, chicken, shiitake mushroom, and / or green vegetables.
4813;Good for the Gym and No Caffeine;I use this every time I go to the gym. It's one of the better tasting powders and it allows me to drink coffee (which I like), for caffeine, and then rely on this Cytomax for energy throughout the workout, plus ease the acid build-up in the muscles that can make you want to puke.
4814;Steel Cut Oats;No fault of the product, but not suited to my lifestyle.  Takes too long to cook on stove, but I haven't been able to cook by microwave - no matter how tall a container I use, it boils over.
4815;Good pancakes don't need syrup... These need syrup!;I bought these for pancakes, and I haven't used it to make any other recipes, so I cannot speak for how it makes biscuits, or any other item. But for pancakes, it's a no-go.
4816;Looove Flaming Cheetos!;Flaming Cheetos is sick.  I love it!  Soooo hot and spicy.
4817;Hot Kid Baby Mum-Mum Vegetable Rice Rusk, 24-Count Boxes;I purchased these for my grand daughter.  She loves them.
4818;A solid juice offering;You know what one of my favorite sounds is? The sound of a can opening. I think it's weird, consider I'm not a huge soda drinker.
4819;Great snack for the fruit-averse;"I'm not a big fan of fresh fruit (I'd much rather eat veggies), but these little bags of ""crunch-dried"" fruit are kind of like the astronaut ice cream of the fruit world. Very satisfying for 70 calories, and at least now I get some of the benefits of eating fruit."
4820;Wish They Were in China;I live in China, and I am unable to find anything made by Jack Link's here. I am able to buy different beef jerky products here, but they just don't taste the same.
4821;Love it. Bring more please!;Nando's closed their local branch here so I couldn't find their sauce anywhere.<br /><br />Highly recommended sauce if you love spicy food.
4822;It's the bomb...;This pickled okra is outstanding.  They are best chilled, however, even at room temperature they are still tasty and crisp.
4823;Very Good;Excellent with warm sourdough whole wheat bread and very convenient.  One box easily serves three people.
4824;Droool;It's Branston pickle, what is there to say. If you've never tried it you most likely wont like it.
4825;Yummy!!!;I was afraid it was going to taste like what I'd imagine fish food smells like, but I decided to take a chance since it's salmon. It didn't taste fishy to me.
4826;The Rolls Royce of Oatmeal;This is the finest oatmeal you can buy.  All you need is twenty minutes and the ability to boil water.
4827;great coffee;My wife loves this coffee over any of the other cups. Have to keep them in tight container for freshness but it's a small bother.
4828;Must taste good;My daughter seems to really like EB's organic squash.  We have been trying to feed her all organic food, and it is so much easier to buy EB than to hunt down Gerber organic foods.
4829;Love it but cheaper elsewhere!;My family had a great time making this gingerbread house. It was good quality and came with plenty of candy.
4830;Very good;I don't like homemade rum cakes, they have too much rum in them and rum is not my favorite liquor.  This has enough to qualify as a rum cake and to be able to taste the cake too.
4831;Great training treats - my cat luvs them;I use these treats for training my Maine Coon.  These are great for training because they are soft enough to break into small pieces and the cat can eat them quickly and await your next command.
4832;i love this;i woke up this morning with the intent of making brunch -  baked grits based on this recipe [..
4833;Best Pancakes...period;Pamela's pancake mix is the basis for the best pancakes you'll ever eat. Although I'm a celiac I've served these pancakes proudly to many others who agree they are better than wheat-based pancakes.
4834;Num, num, num!;Larabar fruit bars are good, especially for we who have many food allergies.  But their Chocolate Coconut Chews are REALLY good!  I think I'm eating a tasty, moist brownie.
4835;best decaf;The best tasting decaf.  Tried all the samples and  decided to stay with this.
4836;My dogs love these;I have five dogs and feed these daily to help keep their teeth clean.  My only complaint is that they are quite expensive to feed on a daily basis.
4837;YUM;My husband loves to keep some in his truck for a snack.  We are set up to get some once a quarter.
4838;Best tasting pretzel snack;I love the shape and taste of mini pretzels like these but don't like the flavor of wheat - so this is the perfect solution. Light on salt, baked just to perfection, with the slightly nutty taste of spelt.
4839;VERY GOOD!;I like turmeric, and this has a slightly different and stronger flavor than what I usually buy.  I don't need to use as much.
4840;6 Stars. This is so great--fulfilled by Amazon, OK;This is the best dark chocolate on earth, I believe. Because, it is organic and free trade and just tastes perfect with the little crunchy raspberry nibs in the bar.
4841;THOSE WERE THE DAYS, MY FRIENDS (ALMOST);Discovered this product while browsing in an ethnic store. It has a cult following to the point of being on, of all places, FACEBOOK.
4842;Sprite;What a create drink to have every other day.What a create drink in the after noon.
4843;Black Relaxed Hair;I love this coconut oil. I use this on my hair.
4844;John Henry's Pecan Rub;John Henry's Pecan Rub arrived securely packaged & on time.  This is an excellent addition to our barbequed meat & chicken.
4845;Awesome!;My boyfriend and I both love coconut water and have been trying different brands for a while. We decided to stick with Zico but it doesn't contain extra sugar or other fruit juices like some of the other ones that we've tried.
4846;Great popcorn, not a great price;"""Real Theater Popcorn"" is the easiest way to get the best theater style popcorn at home (especially if you use a whirleypop popper)<br /><br />But you should be aware that most resellers are selling this stuff for more than you would pay if you just buy direct from the source (and yes it is available online popcornpopper dot com)<br /><br />$1.10 to $1."
4847;CRUNCHY IS THE RIGHT WORD... HEY WHERE'S MY TEETH?;Yep, they're crunchy!  I thought I'd lose a tooth<br />or two just trying to eat them.  They are very<br />thin and not easy to eat.
4848;The VERY BEST Lemon Ginger tea out there!;This tea is the ONLY lemon ginger tea I will buy!  All other brands have some off-flavor, or are mixed with others.  This one has exactly the right blend and is always wonderful.
4849;Weird smell and taste, stay away;I normally don't leave these reviews, but I feel like warning future buyers. I bought the vanilla blueberry as well as the maple walnut clusters pack of three.
4850;Not actually Jesus!;I was super excited about receiving my gluten free communion crackers. Let me tell you.
4851;Lots of calories, lots of carbs, not much protein;"I ordered a box of these Oatmeal Raisin as well as well as the Orange Cranberry flavored bars through the Amazon Vine program. Frankly, I cannot think of why anyone would buy these alleged ""health"" bars."
4852;Best dentals;My Westies loooove those dentals. It works very well between the teeth brushing.
4853;Good but Variable;I bought these at a grocery store and I had all I could do to not eat the whole bag and then lick the wrapper.  So olive-y! So delicious!!!.
4854;Thanks from a Seattleite abroad;MarketSpice Tea is the greatest.  It really gets me through the chilly fall, winter, and spring here in Japan.
4855;Great Puffs, Give'm a Try;These are great.  My daughter loves them and I have no problem giving them to her.
4856;Strong!;I like the taste of this coffee very much, but it is stronger than the Senseo I<br />am used to.  I guess I just need to drink less of it.
4857;In-Your-Face Grapefruit Flavor, Chewy, Not Hard, Store Well;I bought these the last time I was in the US to bring back with me to share with family and friends.<br /><br />These are not hard gummies, be aware of that if you haven't tried the Haribo gummies that have sugar or sour coatings.
4858;Duchess loves it!;My sixteen year old border collie loves this food.  She's was used to dry dog food so I started out mixing this with the dry which she eats heartily, but she really woofs it up when I give it to her plain.
4859;Chocolate fudge is the best.;Chocolate fudge is the best. The rest of them don't taste good to me.
4860;Delicious, smoky, subtle, not too hot;"As the description says, don't be put off by the word ""hot"" in the name.  It has a kick, but it's a lot less hot than cayenne."
4861;Best granola bar ever;These are so awesome. They have great crunch, without being really hard (like nature valley) and the little bits of chocolate throughout the bar are delightful.
4862;Clam Chowda Pizza! It's Awesome! And Simple to make!;"<a href=""http://www.amazon."
4863;Italian Blend Medium;We just bought a Keurig a few months ago and are trying different coffees to try to find what we like best. So far it is the TWC Italian Blend medium.
4864;So-so. Good flavor, but overpriced;If you can get Cameron's flavored coffee priced lower than your supermarket's flavored coffee I recommend stocking up on it. If it's costing you more than the supermarket, go with the supermarket.
4865;Bad Taste;These are the first Hi-Chews I've tried. Got them from a local store.
4866;Very good;Easy to make.Use the Scone Pan sold by Amazon for best results.
4867;It worked for me!;My baby had colic,it's not fun really.our pediatrician recommend and it worked(we used for 7 month),he is 8 and half month old now,we have switched into Enfamil - Premium,and he has not problem at all.
4868;Wonderful Tea.;The tea helped me tremendously with getting a more restful sleep.  I do however, think you should take it when you know you have more time to sleep in.
4869;doggie chewables;This product was shipped in great condition, and on time.  The problem being I thought I was buying the small wafers.
4870;Sunberry Coffee is all I drink!;I am a big coffee drinker.  When it comes to the big commercial brands, I prefer Starbucks over Dunkin Donuts.
4871;For some reason, way better than other matzos;I dont know how they do it, but the texture of these is just great.  From the picture you can see parts that are toasty and parts that are less.
4872;Ridiculous price for good product;The Weight Maintenance version of Pedigree does a good job of maintaining weight, and my dog is happy with the taste. But the $23+ price tag at Amazon is way overweight -- I bought this size bag at my local Wal-*** last week for $12.
4873;The only food I give my cats!;My cats have been on Hill's Science Diet since they came home as kittens. This food is great and keeps them very healthy, it's what the vet has always recommended and I've stuck with for my cats.
4874;Awesome Sauce;The first time I had Dave's Insanity* sauce, I was at a restaurant. The waitress had sensibly warned me about its intensity and suggested I put just a dot of it on my plate to test it out.
4875;Great substitute to whey protein.;Great product and great seller! I don't feel bloated, gassy or uncomfortably full.The taste is also better, in my opinion, than the taste of pea or rice based protein powder.
4876;Tasty treat!;Fruit-flavored mentos are a delicious candy.  The flavor is teriffic.
4877;Great coffee;I'm not a huge coffee drinker but my husband is and we both like this coffee..
4878;love it;love this pineapple. taste super good.
4879;makes the kitty's happy;I buy this products occasionally for my 5 cats, since they really like the taste.  I think it's a very good product, it's not filled with too many fillers, and it doesn't smell too strong.
4880;There are better flavors, but still great Jones Soda;I didn't like this as much as other Jones Soda Flavors - maybe because I don't like that real sweet candy taste.  I find this similar to a sour apple Jolly Rancher candy.
4881;Excellent Tortilla chips;These chips are truly amazing. They have it all.
4882;Fantastic little treats!;Growing up on Oreos and milk is common. So I was taken aback with the brand extension of Oreo's to cakesters.
4883;Pretty good Tea;I like this tea, and its a good value, but I feel like it isn't full bodied tasting as some other roasted rice teas like that of yamamotoyama.  For me it's almost like drinking hot water.
4884;Actually Gluten Free!  This is Good Stuff.;If you've never tasted quinoa, you might want to go get a bag of actual quinoa before you venture into quinoa flour--it smells like bitter squash, and tastes like filberts.<br /><br />However, if you know what kind of flour you are getting, this stuff is great.
4885;Delicious and filling;My whole family really enjoys this cereal.  It is ever so slightly sweet (not the typical sickeningly sweet breakfast cereal!), crunchy, dense and hearty with just the right bite-sizes.
4886;kitty crack;This is the only canned food my kitties will eat. I checked with several Vets and they said it was a perfectly good food.
4887;Flavor Pop? - NOT;I love licorice, so am always eager to try something new. This was just barely OK.
4888;Pleasent surprise.;I had purchased this coffee as part of a random selection on a bundled budget. Of all the coffees, this received the most surprising review by the office coffee drinkers.
4889;cheaper on ebay!;I couldn't believe how much it here.  You can find it much cheaper else where.
4890;THE ABSOLUTE BEST SEASONING EVER!!!;This is without any doubt the best seasoning developed in the history of seasonings. I used to purchase this seasoning at Food Lion, suddenly it vanished, after searching around I found it at Wal-Mart, then suddenly they no longer had it available.
4891;Our dogs LOVE these  chews!!!;We started getting these from our vet after W**m**t treats poisened our Bichon/Cavilier King Charles mix. She spent 10 days in the hospital on IV's, and at death's door.
4892;A Winning Flavored Coffee;"I am a medium to heavy coffee drinker.  I've noticed most of the heavy coffee drinkers I know do not care for ""flavored"" coffees and I must say I've had more I poured out that drank down."
4893;CONSISTENTLY THE BEST;WHEN TRADER JOE NO LONGER CARRIED THEIR FABULOUS TOMATO BISQUE SOUP, WE TRIED EVERY BRAND THAT WAS AVAILABLE AND THEN TURNED TO A TRUSTED NAME AND WE WERE NOT DISAPPOINTED. AMY'S SURPASSES THAT WHICH WE MISSED.
4894;Happy little pappi;I got a sample of this product at an expo. My papillon loved it, so I decided to purchase more.
4895;Love these!;These pouches are a godsend. I keep a stockpile in the pantry and in the car.
4896;The best lentils;My wife cooks a lot of lentils. This product is far superior to other brands on the market, and we've tried them all.
4897;Hibiscus Tea;Healthy tea--a little pricey. Good flavor esp.
4898;Best Xylitol Gum I've found;This is the best xylitol gum I've found. Great cinnamon flavor.
4899;Even finicky eaters will eat it!;My little toy poodle had digestive problems a few months ago and just didn't want to eat dog food. All he wanted was cooked chicken breast, and so, that's what he got (so he'd at least get some food into him).
4900;Great nip;"Every year I buy a container of Cosmic Catnip to make a few ""tube-sock"" type toys with for my cats (currently 8 and 9 years- Female and male respectively) for Christmas. Even with the toy downstairs and wrapped in some thick wrapping paper, the cats go directly to their toy and try to claw off the paper to start playing with it."
4901;decaf;Works good in the blender for shakes and ice slush.<br /><br />Can not find decaf in stores.
4902;Great product just need to adjust the subscription.;My two small dogs took to the food immediately so well in fact I have had to move up the subscription for the 12 pound bag. Since they are young its not immediate if they look healthier or bouncier as they seem to be that way all the time.
4903;La Vie de La Vosgienne Les Framboises;When I ordered this candy, it was out of stock and I worried that it would not arrive before Christmas.  These candies have been a 'stocking-stuffer' tradition for many, many years tho I often have difficulties in finding them.
4904;More like the 10 Hour Energy Drink for me!;I have only used this product 2 different times in the past 8 months, and both times, I drank the whole bottle of it. It's probably not a good idea to do at first, maybe start out with half of the bottle, until you know how it will affect you, but I wanted to see what it would do.
4905;Little Bland, no shaking bag in pouch;I have tried a variety of the Shake & Bake products over the years and mostly enjoyed them. This one we used on standard pork chops, followed the directions and served for an every day family dinner.
4906;Love this!!;I am always looking for easy to cook low-calorie healthy vegetarian items for dinner.  This product is great.
4907;Best Blueberry Cereal;This is the best blueberry cereal I've tried.  Not sickeningly sweet, excellent flavor and texture, stays crunchy even mixed with yogurt.
4908;Good Value for money;I got a dozen boxes for everything like after bath, quarter cup down the drain to keep the drain clean and less smelly. And to mix with vinegar to make a paste to CLEAN the bath tub.
4909;Sad;I loved the Sugar Free Nips, because they were soft, creamy and chewy.  They did not taste like a diet candy.
4910;YUM! If you want a snack, have something REALLY good!;I've found a new taste treat. I'm not a big one for potato chips, so I am sure I've come late to discover these.
4911;BEWARE:  MADE IN CHINA;"I'm disturbed that these treats, as many reviewers state, are so ""addictive."" My dog, too, loves them but has now begun to shun her meals and will only eat these treats."
4912;Delicious!!!;I absolutely LOVE these little cookies!!! I'm not a Fig Newton fan (although my husband loves them!) and I was uncertain about trying these. However, I was pleasantly surprised.
4913;Stash Tea;Great Service and good price. Arrived in a very timely manner.
4914;Great steaks -- Horrible delivery;I ordered 12 steaks but only six arrived.  I contacted Omaha and they said they would send six more.
4915;Delicious but Missing Something;At my title says..
4916;Yummmmmm;When I really want to be decadent, I steep this tea then add a splash of rose hydrosol, aka, rose water (the authentic kind). You could heat rose water and steep the tea directly in it.
4917;All You Taste Is Salt;Save your money. This cheesoning has Way To Much Salt.
4918;Not that great/empty, moldy pods;I admit I might be a bit harsh, but I am really not that satisfied with what I paid for. First, it looks like somebody just swept their arm across a shelf and dumped a bunch of random stuff in a box.
4919;Not Gluten-Free;This item was listed under the gluten-free products and is absolutely not gluten-free.  Luckily I opened a bag and gave it to my one son that does not have the allergy before I realized this mistake.
4920;A perfect cup every morning;Big Easy isn't for everyone but if you like your coffee strong/bold, then Big Easy Bold is the one for you. It's the only one that allows me to select the large mug size without turning whimpy.
4921;Great chips!;"I have to say I am NOT particularly a fan of sweet potatoes but I love these chips.  These chips are unique and a great, healthier alternative to ""standard"" chips."
4922;best breakfast oats;Easy to make ahead of time in a rice cooker or crock pot but even on the stove you are a half hour away from an oaty warm bowl of something really good for you. I prefer my oats a little sweet so I skip adding the salt they recommend and use a little maple syrup and just about any kind of fresh or dried fruit.
4923;Disappointed in Assortment Received;While I was expecting to receive 6 DIFFERENT types of bacon - this is not what was sent.  I received 3 of the same pepper variety.
4924;The only problem is, after the first bite, you cannot stop.;I'm never a fan of popcorn. Hate the chewiness, grease and the sugary flavors.
4925;A delicious and nutritious snack!;These vanilla raisins are a very tasty, low-fat treat
4926;Pretty smooth way to enjoy espresso!;While these aren't my first choice for beans (local roaster makes the best!), I decided to try these based upon (a) the Lavazza name - usually equated with good coffees and (b) my experience with another Lavazza coffee (caffinated) from Amazon. My expectations were high, and this offering did not disappoint.
4927;Very poor quality;I did not like these chews. They were really light and loosely rolled.
4928;Great for occassional visitors from outside;These have trapped all of the occasional 6 legged visitors in the basement and entrance hallway.  You can see how many visitors, too.
4929;FAVORITE TREAT;By far my dogs favorite treat, it is also very healthy.  My crazy friend decide to taste it, he said it was excellent, a chicken jerky with less fat and preservatives.
4930;I love this gum;I love this gum, but it's getting harder to find in most brick and mortar stores.  Of course, Amazon has it!  Good stuff.
4931;bulk tea;The tea is bitter because I made it too strong. It would be much better for me if the bag had instructions on the amount to be used.
4932;Too easy!;This was way too easy for my dogs. I have dog that is super smart and I knew he'd get it quickly but I bought it for my other dog that is a bit slower.
4933;Good stuff;I love this stuff..
4934;Cocoa wasn't bad. . .Price was horrible;The Cocoa wasn't too bad. The taste is ok and as good as other hot chocolate mixes.
4935;Tasty Treats - Questionable source;Treats smell so good I would like to eat them myself. They are manufactured in China and they look shiny on the outside and I am not sure how that happens to the chicken and the company has not responded to my questions about this.
4936;K-cups;These k-cups were good. It was the delivery charge that I was upset with.
4937;love this mix;I am GF for 2 years now. This mix makes the bes banana bread ( add 3 ripped bananas mushed, then mix, I use olive oil instead of butter and lactose free milk, mix well then add 1-1.
4938;Smokin!;If you love almonds - especially Blue Diamond Almonds, these are great!  It is like Blue Diamond Almonds on steroids.  They are not incredibly spicy, but they have a little zip and a good amount of flavor.
4939;This is great coffee;This bean turned out to some of the best home roast that this reviewer has ever had. I had trouble messing up this coffee.
4940;Great mild breakfast coffee!;My wife has drunk this coffee for several years.  She tried many different brands before settling on this k-cup.
4941;first time cocao nibs purchaser;I have read countless articles about the health benefits of cacao nibs and was excited to purchase these. I even ripped open the bag upon receiving the product from Amazon excited to get my chocolate fix! However, after stuffing a small handful into my mouth expecting a chocolatey taste, I was surprised at the bitter almost coffee like taste (similar to the dregs at the bottom of an espresso).
4942;My dog loves this treat;I learned about this treat in a magazine article reviewing it. I have been looking for convenient treat, which is small, dry (so that I don't have to keep in the fridge), and irresistible to my dog, which is almost impossible since my dog is not food motivated at all.
4943;The Worst I've Ever Eaten;I started a low carb. diet and have been trying different brands of turkey jerky.
4944;Pooptacularly Bad;I tried this cat food for my 5 month old kitten.  we used this for about two weeks thinking that her stomach would get used to it.
4945;Healthy option;These almonds taste good, not as well flavored as the cinnamon or vanilla flavored but a decent change of pace.  A little plain though.
4946;Liquid Gold;I saw this tea at a local farmer's market and bought it.  I read the description and thought I would give it a try.
4947;Tried it...loved it...now my favorite herbal tea;Based on the other review, I went and tried this tea.  As a choir member, I am always interested in licorice products since they soothe a worn voice.
4948;like Alton Brown's salt cellar;We use this in the kitchen, just like Alton Brown (this one isn't endorsed by him, but we couldn't find one that is).  It's a great way to get to our salt for adding to recipes, rather than trying to dump it out of those little spouts on the boxes.
4949;potato & duck dry food;I order Natural Balance food for my pit bull, because of allergies. She gobbles it down.
4950;Makes excellent iced tea.;This makes excellent iced tea! The tea has a very good lemon flavor, think more like a lemon oil or lemon extract type of flavor, you will still need to add lemon juice if you like your iced tea to be a bit on the sour side. I make it in 1 quart batches, boiling water for 5 minutes, 4 packets of equal and a splash of lemon juice, then I steep the leaves again for a 2nd brewing using the same amount of equal as the first.
4951;tea review;This tea smells wonderful but I think it needs to be made very strong to get the taste.It helps to add some sweetener.
4952;Great coffee;For the price is coffee is pretty good, I like a strong cup and it does a good job. I have been using it for about 6 months now and have it on auto ship.
4953;Great value;My Golden Retreiver loves these treats, and I love the value. We break each stick into 3 pieces, so they last a long time.
4954;Tasty & effective;I really like this particular magnesium supplement. In ice cold water it tastes much like lemonade! It helps with minor muscle aches, headaches, and constipation.
4955;Dogs Love These;This is my second time buying these for my dogs.  The last box of 6 bags went very quickly with two hungry golden retrievers who love these treats.
4956;great feeding option;I received the first jug as a gift for my golden retriever (80 lb.), then bought a second one when I picked up a Wheaten terrier (30 lb).
4957;So Delicious!!;These candies are so delicious! It tastes like you are sucking on fruit. They are cute too.
4958;Problems caused by summer temperatures;The seller of York Peppermint patties tried twice to send me their product, but due to circumstances beyond their control, the merchandise arrived in a partially melted condtion.<br />The seller did their best to compensate, but it did not work.
4959;A loyal drinker (!) for years;Simply stated, I've been drinking this specific tea for several years now after an experiment went (happily) well.  Some friends have found it to be too sweet, but they needed to be corrected in that no sugar is required (because they inadvertently added some).
4960;Move Over Old Bay- This is for Real Cooks~;I love this seasoning. It truly is magic.
4961;my siberian husky likes it;i wanted to make sure i wasn't feeding my siberian husky junk, and have heard good things about blue buffalo..
4962;Great Machine and popcorn;I got an 8ounce kettle popper and combo popcorn packets and have used them almost every night. The popcorn tastes great and the packets make it super easy.
4963;Best Dog Food!!;I was worried that my chihuahua would not like this food since she is a very picky eater, but she loves it. Since she doesn't eat as much of this food, it offsets the price.
4964;Chocolatey Peanutty Satisfaction;Good snack. More filling than other bars.
4965;YET ANOTHER EPIC FAIL;I ordered tulips for my wife because they are her favorite flower.<br /><br />Instead of the 30 Multicolored tulips I ordered she receives a dozen roses.
4966;Meow, More Please!;So ..
4967;Very good xylitol mints, kids love them too;These mints are great -- I like the minty taste and the cavity-preventing xylitol content.<br /><br />My kids enjoy the taste and having 1-2 after each meal has become a treat.
4968;Sun-Dried Olives and Almonds (Olive Essicate con Mandorle);For some you will have to aquire a taste for the way these olives are cured. If you are willing to try it and hang in there it is well worth it though.
4969;Great Product!;My son is allergy to wheat, nut, milk, soy..
4970;Not a Fan;Refer to the picture I posted above.  The bar is half the size you think it is going to be.
4971;great for breast feeding moms!!!!;Chicory and barley are both galactogogues, so this product is great for breast feeding moms who want coffee flavor, but do not want the caffeine to pass on to their little ones. I have been using it throughout my whole pregnancy and the 8 weeks since delivery.
4972;Watery, flavorless, sour;Agree with the reviewers who pointed out this is too watery, acidic, and tomatoe-y. It doesn't taste like beef at all.
4973;Excellent cornbead;I had been trying to make GF cornbread from scratch with limited success. Now I don't have to! Tried this for the first time and it is excellent.
4974;spicy thai chips;TOTALLY ORGASMIC.  these chips are the best spicy chip i have ever tasted.
4975;Great Tasting!!!;"I wanted a natural sport drink and ""O.N."
4976;Not Happy;I just received these, and I will not be giving them to my baby. They are made in China.
4977;Holey smokes;Let me just tell you what a great decision 5 hour energy drink made at the corporate level.  As soon as I received my first case I popped open the first bottle and chugged it down.
4978;Great Product!;We've given our dog Zuke's Hip Action for about two years. She had been taking Rimadyl for back problems, but due to some other health problems could no longer take that long term.
4979;easy nutrition;get this for my mom & she'd addicted. Its the only sure way to get a bit of fiber & protien into her (the rest is a battle).
4980;Amazing!;I found these at Costco first, and decided to buy them on here because I can get an all Blackberry case which in my opinion is the best(not a huge fan of the Orange..
4981;Bought this on a doctor's recommendation;"Great treatment for ""male-related"" issue as we age. No, it's not for ED ."
4982;wonderful;This coffee is the best, we used green mountain for many years and paid way to much. This is a wonderful coffee and the price is hard to beat.
4983;San Fran Bay Coffee;I was pleased with this brand of K-cup coffee.  Instead of coming in a small plastic (not very green!) container it comes in a mesh-like pouch making the coffee flow through it easier.
4984;bait for training and all treats;Both of my dogs love this stuff.  We use it for training treats and to train our young male giant breed to pay attention while walking past rabbits.
4985;MNCook;Disappointing.  Healthy Choice is usually great - this was doughy and had a very cloudy, flouring taste to the broth.
4986;Walnut and date;These were the best nutrient bars I have had EVER!!!  They tasted like walnuts and dates and I will certainly order more.  Keep making them.
4987;Poor customer service;"Sticker on invoice: ""We care about your satisfaction with our products and service. If you have any concerns or questions about your shipment, please call us toll free at."
4988;An underrated energy drink;This energy drink is a little bit different. It has a bit of a kick behind the taste(which is unique)and pours nicely out of the thick can.
4989;Popcorners--Cheesy Jalapeno;While on a JetBlue flight, we had some PoPCorners as a snack.  I had not had this before but thought it made a great snack.
4990;Looks like good stuff!;The ingredients+price almost seem too good to be true.  That's my main thing lol.
4991;IT REALLY WORKS;BETA SITOSTEROL<br /><br />I ordered and promptly got it. I have been using it for more then four months and I find it very useful daily supplement.
4992;Could be better;I was recommended this product from my dogs allergist so ordered several bags from amazon.com.
4993;Best Dressing they make;The ranch was ok, the Chipotle is super spicy. But this one is definately my favorite.
4994;Great Taste;First, great value for this sport drink and second, the tropical fruit flavor is good (even better cold). I used it to train for a marathon and I will continue to use it
4995;It really works!!;I got this Yogi Muscle Recovery tea after starting a rigorous exercise program. In the past the only thing that stopped me from increased exercise was sore muscles, now that is no longer a problem! I will drink this tea before and after a workout and it is amazing the difference I feel!<br />This works very well for tired muscles.
4996;Miracle-gro for the garden;"I've only been gardening for a few years, and this is the first fertilizer I ever used.  A few days after applying this product, all of my ""struggling"" garden plants seemed to get over their iffy stage and just took off."
4997;Fantastic;I ordered this for my Irish mother around the holidays. She ate all but the blue cheese and said she loved every bite and wanted more.
4998;Best laxitive yet;I was looking for a basic natural fiber product that tastes good. This works.
4999;SeaBear;This is a very good salmon product.  It is not smoked, so you are not losing the good omega 3 oil.
5000;Scarpetta is betta;My husband and I love the Tomato and Arugula sauce.  I served it the other day with asparagus tips warmed  in the sauce, over Kashi Pilaf with a poached egg on top and a bit of Parmesan.
5001;Very nice flavor;My husband hates protein drinks and he gives two thumbs up to this product. We drink it daily! Try it you won't be sorry, promise! The Vanilla is a nice change from the mocha because you can add ANY flavoring to it and make it whatever you like flavor-wise.
5002;You don't need to got to Italy to have a great espresso;Great espresso coffee. I own Breville espresso coffee machine and this coffee is perfect.
5003;Great flavor;I am the buyer of this fine product for the last 40 years. It is great for salads, especially with tomatoes.
5004;Good quality...good price;This product worked really well and I am happy with my purchase. I used them for cake pops and they wrote vibrant and easy, unlike the Wilton ones I purchased before these.
5005;Yum!;The product was delivered quickly. Even though the weather was still quite warm at the time of delivery, none of the Curly Wurlys were melted.
5006;Just what I was looking for;Just what I need for a recipe I wanted to make..
5007;Very disappointed;I bought these bars to use as a good snack to help me loose weight. With chocolate and peanut butter, 2 of my favorites, how could I loose? I was very disappointed in the taste and texture.
5008;Pretty good flavor !  Great price !;After reading all of the dented can reviews, I wasn't sure what to expect. I did get 3 dented cans out of the 12- one was a mild ding, one was fair, and one was such that if I'd been picking it out at the grocery store, I would have looked for a different one- I just ate that one first.
5009;Not caffeine free;The tea I received is not caffeine free. The box is different from the pictured box as well.
5010;Nylabonre Healthy Edibles treats;Good product.  My 3 dogs love them.
5011;Great snack!;These are super tasty and addictive!..
5012;Salmon Formula;This smells more like cat food. My dogs ate the first can, but I mixed half with their previous food.
5013;Excellent Sardines! Delicious!;I've always liked sardines. I guess a lot of people don't.
5014;Yummy...;These are tasty asusual, not too sweet just a kiss of honey-loved that they are in mini packs helps to keep them fresh and makes is easy to grab some on the go. They were so good we ate them before we could make smores, or have them in any other recipes for that matter.
5015;Yumm-o;These are deliciously soft and yummy. I could do without the nuts though!! They taste even better warmed up as well.
5016;NOT suitable as strawberry flavor;I can believe the source material used for this extract may have, by some miracle, exhibited strawberry genes..
5017;Love the product but cancelling my subscription -Amazon raised the $$;I absolutely love this stuff! I don't drink coffee but used to be addicted to the energy drinks..
5018;Good birthday sausages!;I can't vouch personally for this product as I selected it to send as a gift to my brother-in-law for his birthday (he lives on the East Coast of the USA and I live in London).  It was delivered very quickly in plenty of time for the actual date I wanted it to arrive.
5019;Best wet food!;Nice to know my 15 year old cat is eating healthy organic food (and has done for years) AND he is crazy about the taste. He is very picky and wont even touch the other flavours.
5020;Low Calorie Dental Sticks;These are great treats!  My dog is older and has a few extra pounds so I decided to buy these for her.  She loves them.
5021;Good quality, priced too high;The unsalted Dan-D-Pak cashews were good quality, large and not over roasted.  However, the price was a little too high.
5022;Good GF cookies;We can get these at our local store and tend to pick them up whenever we're shopping. They're great little cookies - not much bigger than a half-dollar coin.
5023;My 7th favorite flavor;Diamond Almonds<br />Almonds are a good source of magnesium. One ounce contain approximately 20% of the RDA for an adult recommended dietary allowance (RDA)<br />Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) the amounts of selected nutrients considered adequate to meet the known nutrient needs of healthy people.
5024;If you like jerky this is it!;This is excellent jerky.  I could eat the whole bag in one setting.
5025;These are for dogs!;"I should have realized it from the picture that these pill pockets are for DOGS! I searched ""Greenies pill pocket cats"" and this popped up. I saw the price and thought, ""Hey! That's great"" and placed my order."
5026;Horrible;I had to pick up a grocery store brand after running out of our regular Innova dog food. I fed this to my 160lb dog for a week and could not believe the amount of waste this brand produced! He was going up to 10 times a day! Unbelievable! This just goes to show how much filler is in this food.
5027;1st rate from someone who knows better;This will be a short review (for me).<br /><br />I am somewhat of a tea connoisseur, so for me to give a tea 5 stars.
5028;Works much better dry as a snack;OK, I'm an unrepentant chocoholic. I admit it.
5029;Great snack item!;I had had these at my parents' house but there are no local stores that carry it so I decided to place an order. I was worried that they'd come broken or that they wouldn't be as fresh as they are from the grocery store.
5030;as functional as it is colorful;these little rolls of bags are smaller than other brands you can get at baby supply stores. we originally received it as a baby shower gift.
5031;Scrumptious;I ordered a case of 12 packages and only three cookies were broken. They taste delicious and eight cookies are only 130 calories.
5032;Twice as good as the best Peanut Butter!;Sent to us as a gift from our San Diego son, It disappeared in two weeks.<br />Frantically searched for it on Google, as it has become a near daily staple<br />for lunch & snacks.
5033;OMGOODNESS!;When I received my package in the mail it came in a white envelope clearly labeled Red Leaf Tea! I was surprised at how quickly my tea arrived! The matcha itself came in a shiny golden envelope with lovely labeling and the type of matcha I ordered printed on a smaller label stuck on it.<br /><br />When I opened the bag containing my tea the smell was intoxicating! Vanilla, Cream, Butter.
5034;So so so so so so good!;"This is so delicious! Truly a taste sensation. I could enjoy this any time of day but for me I believe this will be my evening ""night cap"" since it made with the white matcha I think I can get away with this! YUMMY! It truly feels like I am having a cocktail but I don't drink alcohol so this is a lovely substitute!<br /><br />I would love to be able to tell you some flavoring notes I pick up but its quite simple - its AMARETTO! lol I don't know how else to describe this."
5035;Harry1942;The delivery was very prompt, and true to the description the beans were a dark oily roast.  The packaging has maintained excellent freshness, even after months in our freezer.
5036;Why is this tea not famous and widely available?;You used to be able to find Stash Licorice at major grocery stores, and I'm baffled as to why it has disappeared from shelves and can only be found online. It's the only herbal tea I've found that is naturally sweet so you don't have to add sugar or sweeteners.
5037;Slighty spicy, deliciously salty... an AMAZING treat for saladito lovers!;I bought these and the company's salt saladitos. not only did the product arrive quickly, but they taste AMAZING! I have been eating saladitos all my life, and these are the top quality!! They actually taste fresh and a little fleshy, not like those store bought brands that are rock hard and got no meat to it.
5038;Illy issimo coffee;Not the greatest canned coffee ever made..
5039;Best Tasting Fruit Gum Available;It actually tastes like a strawberry smoothie. It's starts out cold, just like IceBreakers Ice Cubes should.
5040;Best decaff coffee;This is the best decaffinated coffee I have found in single servings
5041;Yummy!;I was pleasantly surprised by this granola. I cannot eat raisins or nuts, so I have a hard time finding granola that I CAN eat so I tried this one.
5042;Contains MSG!! (free glutamic acid);"I thought this was supposed to be the ""healthy"" soup option, but it's just come to my attention when shopping for some other soup brands that the ingredient ""natural flavors"" this soup contains, is a cover word for the main ingredient in MSG which is responsible for causing unhealthy effects: free glutamic acid. The food industry uses words like these because they don't want you to know the truth about the unhealthy ingredients in the food, as they would get less buyers."
5043;Alternate Uses;Perfect for our needs.  While we did use the peppermint leaves for cooking, we also used it in outside doorways to keep away unwanted pests (mice) who dislike the smell.
5044;Review for Quaker oatmeal squares, cinnamon flavor;This cereal reminds me of frosted mini wheats. When eaten without milk, it is not too sweet but is still sweet enough to avoid being bland.
5045;Better than store bought!;We have tried several gluten free packaged bread and bread mixes. All the packaged breads taste like cardboard-this mix actually has the consistency of sandwich bread.
5046;Very Happy!;I love quinoa for its delicious taste, texture, and nutritional benefits. This NOW brand as sold on Amazon is a great bargain.
5047;vegetarians rejoice;A great substitution for chicken or scallops in stirfry.  Look forward to using more Loma Linda products.
5048;Stopped my leg cramps...;I've been drinking a bit of this mixed in water before bed, and my night leg cramps have stopped. 'nuff said.
5049;Wow! Shiney Coat!;I waited to review this food because I truly wanted to see what changes would be evident in my dogs coat, etc. She is a 5# and 6 year old breed of Pom and Yorkie.
5050;Best Oat Bran Out There;I used to eat Quaker Oat Bran but one day discovered Hodgson's. I eat it every morning and it is the best, brown and crunchy compared to the bland whiteness of Quaker or Mother's.
5051;Very very good coffee;"I had never of this source but the reviews (positive) are right and this coffee is a ""keeper"". The coffee is bold are really a ""kick a__"" blend at a good price for K-cup coffee."
5052;Canidae Dog Food;This is one of the best dog foods on the market.  It saved me quite a bit of money to order it directly through Amazon rather than try to find it locally.
5053;INCREDIBLY HEALTHY BUT INCREDIBLY EXPENSIVE;My male Rottweiler has allergies and can have these snacks without worry.  Unfortunately, they are hard to find, extremely expensive at more than $10 a bag (about 14 small bones,) and the shipping and handling costs are KILLER.
5054;Meowwww  Great!;This is my cat's favorite treat.  I give her in late evening mixed with a little dry food, for an extra boost of protein (since it is 100% pure chicken, freeze dried.
5055;great taste!;This is a quick and easy to make chocolate pudding that's DAIRY FREE!  We take this when we travel, shake it up in a  protein shake shaker and it works every time.  Don't add too much water.
5056;Liquid Cocoa Puffs;This my friends is perfection among coconut water. I love all of Zico varieties  but this one is the best.
5057;Newman's Turkey and Brown rice formula;My dogs love Newman's turkey and brown rice. I have been feeding it to them for about a year.
5058;Fantastic Results;"For years I've used <a href=""http://www.amazon."
5059;wow;The garlic are good but the vinegar and salt are the best. I am so addicted I signed up for the bi-monthly shipments.
5060;Best pectin ever;I love this pectin. I love that it is so easy and requires so little sugar.
5061;Dog Luvers dream;If you have a dog that is a picky eater, well this is the dog food for you.  The local pet store can't even keep this stuff on the shelf.
5062;Excellent tasting coffee;The brand name didn't really attract me to this product.  With coffee I seldom go for big brands and love to try unique coffees from small independent roasters.
5063;Sugary but high in fiber;As a young guy im concerned with taste and also fiber content. This is high in sugar/carbs but it's entirely justified for the great taste and the high fiber.
5064;Excellent taste and nutrition;The dark chocolate cherry cashew kind plus bar combines everything I enjoy. The dark chocolate is not too sweet and the cashews add the right amount of crunch.
5065;Count Me Among Those Who Consider Felidae a Life Saver;I have two feral rescues who have lived with me since 2005.  One, Commander Fluffypants, I trapped as a young kitten.
5066;Didn't work for me;I read all the reviews of this product and couldn't wait to use it. I took it for over a week when my baby started to get extremely fussy.
5067;Splenda in every flavor...tastes horrible;Wanted the Sodastream for my birthday.  Got it, made up the first cola.
5068;No Hazelnut flavor;Bought this as a gift for a Hazelnut coffee lover who disliked it. She said it doesn't even taste like hazelnut.
5069;Smells great, but ...;I bought these K-Cups based on glowing reviews here (and elsewhere). They smell great while they are brewing: you can definitely smell french toast on the griddle.
5070;Lovely;I'm a big fan of this sipping chocolate. It doesn't have chemical-type ingredients or nasty oils, so that's a big plus.
5071;My favorite flavor;These wonderful fruits are of a consistency somewhere between apple sauce and baby food. After trying all of the flavors, I especially enjoyed this somewhat tropical blend, with just the overtones of banana baby food I've missed since my daughter grew up.
5072;Deliciously uncommon;I bought this candy bar after trying a candy bar at an old irish shop that i was told i probably couldn't get here in the states
5073;Fantastic flavor!;This coffee is delicious.  We expected a 5lb bag to last us much longer than this has.
5074;Gift To Rice Cake Eaters Everywhere!;For those of you unfamiliar with Paskesz rice cakes, the compressed nature of their rice cakes is a gift to rice cake eaters! There is minimal mess and very little crumbling when you eat these mini rice cakes. It's so much more satisfying to eat a finger sandwich made with these as opposed to trying to get your mouth around the standard sized height of a rice cake.
5075;Yummy;We love this cereal! The fact that is Organic and good is a plus. We like to use it as a snack rite out of the package.
5076;Caramel apple cider;I love this cider. It is really tasty and I hope I've got enough to last before it is no longer available.
5077;Terrific Product for Doggie Breath!;"The Greenies ordered through Amazon is less expensive than the ""bricks & mortar"" stores"
5078;it works!!!!;words cannot describe this oil, it does everthing it says. it stops any damage and breakage i have, i love it and i hope they never stop selling it.
5079;My favorite tea!;I was so excited to find this tea on Amazon and with subscribe and save to top it off! This Lavender Earl Grey tea is so hard to find in stores and is not an inexpensive tea. A much better buy on Amazon to buy in bulk and so convenient to have it shipped right to my house and often within 2 days! And to think I used to have to LOOK for this tea all over the place! I buy 6 boxes at a time on Amazon and I also buy the loose Earl Grey tea (I think Davidsons?) on Amazon too.
5080;Rich but not bitter;Newman's Own dark chocolate is labeled as 54% cocoa. This percentage indicates how much of the natural cocoa butter and cacao solids are in the chocolate bar.
5081;Yummy Goodness!;I just finished my first bowl of Umpqua Oats and had to grab my computer to write a review about it. I'm not the healthiest of eaters, though I really try to be.
5082;"Don't pay for ""expedited"" delivery";"I paid over $13.00 for ""expedited"" delivery and the product still took FIVE days to arrive."
5083;No Sugar really?;The forgot to say that ADDED Sugar was the 3rd ingredient on the list. What a joke.
5084;bal;Bahlsen Delice Cookies, 3.5-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 12)<br />Very Disappointed with your service and deceptive listing of the product ingredients.
5085;Got one!;Okay, a lot of stuff is written about gopher traps & I can tell you I got one big gopher after 2 days with one of the two traps I set. I guess you could spend more for a trap, but I can testify at least one of the traps I set got a gopher.
5086;Pretty sure this has some sugar added;Despite the fact it claims to contain only coconut water and pulp, I am pretty sure this has some sugar added to it. It is way too sweet.
5087;Love these chips!;These chips are great. I love the hot and spicy seasoning.
5088;This is not the tea storage box you are looking for!;"If you are looking for a tea storage box, and happen to stumble upon Amazon's subscribe and save page on two leaves and a bud tea presentation box, please note that teas are included, even though Amazon specifically says ""Two Leaves and a Bud Bamboo Presentation Box (Tea Not Included)"". This is a problem, as if you don't like the box, you cannot return it."
5089;Quite Good;Yes, I got my box for free. I probably wouldn't have bought it.
5090;Great Gift, Big Hit;Bought this for my husband as he a new coffee drinker and wasn't really sure what he liked.  He LOVES two of the flavors, really likes a third and finds the fourth just ok.
5091;Just like Starbucks!;These are so amazing, they remind me of green tea lattes from Starbucks. Much, much cheaper though for the same flavor.
5092;Delicious and easy!;Most packaged sauces are pretty boring and light on taste, but this is no ordinary packaged sauce.  This sauce is delicate and flavorful - it tastes like I spent hours working on the perfect spice blend.
5093;Great Selection. Great Price.;A lot of people are complaining about the fact that these come in a brown bag. They are in a brown bag, INSIDE of an amazon box.
5094;old things may be better?;To avoid all the chemicals and sugar in all the newer sweeteners like Splenda..
5095;DEEEEEE-FREAKING-LICIOUS!;1.  I love  Amazon's grocery/makeup/cleaning products subscription service.
5096;Not satisfactory;I bought 21 0z freeze dried liver. Half the container was filled with powder instead of pieces/chunks.
5097;A Favorite Year after Year;We make most of our tea from loose leaf in a press pot. Sleepytime is the lone exception.
5098;disappointed;When I was a kid, a very long time ago, we ate a lot of Spam.  My mother worked.
5099;Good tasting water.;Good tasting water.  This is a big bottle of water
5100;Raw Healthy Freeze dried snack ...but so expensive;Nature's Variety Snacks seem to have the right ingredients. My dogs were barely interested in the treats.
5101;Good taste---but;These are good, rich cookies, but I would not buy them from amazon again because they were so poorly packed that half of them were falling apart or already crumbs. I'll go back to buying them locally.
5102;Never Again;I ordered the Deluxe 6oz Red Popcorn Maker Machine by Paramount Entertainment and as an accompaniment I also ordered the Great Northern Popcorn, 6-Ounce Portion Packs (24 pack). The popcorn maker I like very much but the Great Northern Popcorn is terrible.
5103;A shout-out to those of us who want to maintain a healthy weight!;Due partially to the use of Splenda, Murrays makes the best-tasting sugar free cookies out there.  But don't forget they still have carbs! Chocolate chip is my personal favorite.
5104;Fantastic;I love to eat sardines and such while fishing. I just tried the Polar Kipper Snacks and they were fantastic.
5105;could be better;I'm used to going to Starbucks for vanilla lattes and I was hoping this coffee would have a sweet vanilla flavor to it.  Although I'm glad to be contributing to buying Starbucks products, this coffee flavor is a let-down.
5106;Does Seem To Make Wine Taste Better - But Messy;My wife is the wine drinker in the family and she has many times picked wine that has been aerated from the Vinturi out in a blind taste test as tasting better.  I personally didn't think it would actually do anything but she seems to notice the different.
5107;Love these for my old guy...;Even though these are pricey, my old Aussie Shep loves them. I am glad there is a special senior formula.
5108;Cheeseburger in a bowl;"This is your typical ""add hamburger,"" pasta & seasoning boxed meal.  The difference it that it comes with a packet of creamy Velveeta cheese."
5109;"Nothing at all like the cereal in milk but OK as ""Treats""";"Why did they have to use brown rice? Just because I have to eat gluten-free does not always mean I want to eat ""healthy"". I was so disappointed when I saw that they would not just be altering the originally recipe for this cereal."
5110;BPA? Yes and no...;"I contacted Muir Glen directly and asked whether or not their cans contained BPA. You can see their response below:<br /><br />""Thank you for contacting Muir Glen about bisphenol-A or BPA."
5111;So Good!;I can't believe there aren't any other reviews here yet. These are great.
5112;Love This Movie!;This movie is a very odd movie but I love it because it doesn't follow that Hollywood way to make a movie.  This movie stars Winona Ryder who plays Lydia Deitz, who is very sad and depressed.
5113;Excellent food for dogs with allergies;My golden|yellow lab mix was adopted from the shelter with a number of health issues including severe malnutrition, a pretty bad skin condition, and chronic  inflammation of the feet and face.  We placed him on an elimination diet and found that he was allergic to chicken, turkey and beef.
5114;The dogs love these!;My dogs definately give this product a four paws up! These tiny bits of salmon are great to use for training. Healthy as well as tasty (apparantly), a good combination.
5115;Good for Breakfast;"Panettone is an Italian Christmas tradition. A product that is inherently artisanal and difficult to make, requires use of ""sourdoughs"" from Milan that have been sometimes kept alive for over a century."
5116;Great tasting organic power/breakfast bar;Great tasting organic power/breakfast bar - only 160 calories.  Perfect blend of low fat/high protien that taste very good.
5117;Good chips, more cheese;They are good but need more cheese and wish they were krinkle cut. I much prefer the salt & pepper just for the krinkle cut - they have a better texture.
5118;My new favorite!;Discovered coconut water this summer and I love it!  It tastes great and is very refreshing.  We took some bottles with us when hiking on hot summer days and the coconut water kept us going.
5119;Excellent!;I have always enjoyed Earl Grey tea because of the flavor of Bergamot.  I was pleased to find that there is this version of Earl Grey with Double Bergamot which only enhances the flavor!  I love this tea and believe anyone who enjoys Earl Grey will love this as well.
5120;shiitake mushrooms;A great buy when you consider the price of shiitakes in the stores. I used to buy large bags of shiitakes at Costco', but do not carry them anymore.
5121;Works for me and I exclusively pump;Very fortunate that it worked/works for me. I took one capsule every time I pumped.
5122;Classic Tomato (almost);Campbell's is known for soup and they did a pretty good job with the Soup at Hand meal. It tastes close to the canned stuff and isn't to bad with a grilled cheese sandwich.
5123;Nothing like the real thing;Bought this yesterday and was very excited to try the salted caramel one, since I LOVE IT at Starbucks.  Made it according to directions and was very disappointed with the flavor.
5124;No Super Saver = Very Disappointing;This product would be worth buying on Amazon if Super Saver applied but it does not.  Without SS the total price is almost the same as if ordered from Herrs' site.
5125;boy they are minced small;ask yourself if u might not prefer chopped clams. Minced are minced very very very  very small.
5126;Toasted Rice Tea;I love this hard-to-find tea that I discovered at The Japanese Tea Garden in San Francisco. It is not strong, and one can drink it all day, hot or cold.
5127;Mmmmmmmmm!;I agree with a previous reviewer..
5128;Best EVER!!!;Aloha from Hawaii!<br />I absolutely love this product especially since it DOES NOT have the bad after taste like the artificial sweetners. This tastes really like sugar but isn't.
5129;KETTLE CHIPS -- DISAPPOINTINF;I ORDERED KETTLE CHIPS IN THE FOLLOWING FLAVVORS<br />SALT & FRESH GROUND PEPPER<br />TUSCAN 3 CHEESE<br />N.Y.
5130;Healthy food, happy Kids, no mess - happy mom too.;My kids love Ella's Kitchen Apple Banana sauce.  We have purchased various flavors and various brands of this type of product - fruit sauce in a pouch.
5131;High quality, organic!, a little flat;I have been drinking fine tea for a few years now. I have a couple of favorite Assams that I have enjoyed for some time.
5132;Crunchy, corny, and good;It is difficult to explain what exactly this new cereal tastes like. It's good, crunchy, and sweet.
5133;Other products taste better and healthier;I used this product for many years. I favored them for high quality ingredients, excellent flavor, reasonable price, and wide availability.
5134;Good, strong coffee, high price;I do love the Vue, it erased the complaints I had about the regular Keurig. The problem is that there aren't enough varieties of Vue Cups yet, and they are expensive.
5135;Never ordering cat food online ever again!!!;I ordered this for my 17 year old cat. She only has one tooth and is very finicky.
5136;Dogs love these bones and I can see a difference;These really whiten their teeth.<br />And the dogs love them.
5137;Great coffee blend, in my opinion;I've been buying this coffee for something like a year now, ever since I first tried it. It is exactly the kind of coffee I like - dark, lively-tasting, full-bodied, and rich, with NO bitterness and NO ashtray aftertaste.
5138;Easy to Use/Easily Tolerated;This product is easy to mix into my daughter's milk or yogurt and doesn't seem to upset her stomach.  It is a nice alternative to cod liver oil which can really upset a little one's stomach.
5139;Simply wonderful!;Superfast Shipping! I had ordered the bamboo on Monday and had received an email the following day that the they had been shipped and would be receiving them by Thursday.  The seller instructions on what I needed to do when the shipment arrive as well as what needs to be done to take care of the plants.
5140;terrible;firstly, the packaging. all of the tubs were opened, plastic cracked, tubs lids do not fit the bowls so they can't actually close and seal the contents, it looked like one tub was eaten out of, apricots missing.
5141;Great!;Love the taste and it's much less salty than the store-bought cubes.  Easy to use.
5142;Still the best!;"When I first got my K-cup machine a couple years ago I ordered virtually every coffee/tea cup brand except for the inane.  The Newman extra bold is the best ""every day"" coffee IMO."
5143;YUMMY;We always drink Timmothy's or Emeril's. Thought we would try something different.
5144;Boring, Flavorless, Lackluster Hot Cocoa;I love my Keurig and I was ecstatic about the hot cocoa option. My Keurig came with this flavor as part of the variety pack, and I have to say, it was probably the worst hot cocoa I have ever had.
5145;Great for lattes;I bought 3 flavors, peppermint, vanilla and chocolate. We have used them to flavor our lattes.
5146;Bleh!;I got some free samples in the mail and tried this stuff directly.  It really didn't taste near as sweet as sugar, and has left a bad aftertaste in my mouth.
5147;Glad to find OTC's, but...;Like others, I grew up with OTC's.  Received the shipment and it was full of stale crackers.
5148;Love the tea!!;My husband is the tea drinker in our household. I love my coffee.
5149;Disappointed;I figured this coffee would be great from seeing the good reviews. I'm starting to think they are from the company.
5150;Great gift!;The candies were a big hit with my Husband. He loves these candies and I surprised him for our 25TH Wedding Anniversary with these lovely little liqueur chocolates.
5151;Awesome Snack;For this product to be baked, all natural, its very good.  I like it as well as Cheetos Puffs, which were my favorite.
5152;Cheap Price;
5153;Love it!;I love that there are so few kernels left unpopped in my Whirly Pop. The popcorn itself pops up small, but is delicious! Another plus is that the hulls don't get caught in your teeth.
5154;Enjoy Life Sugar cookies;These cookies are great, great taste, healthy ingredients. I amm gluten and lactose intolerant and it is not too hard to find cookies made with out gluten, but finding cookies with no eggs, lactose and gluten is difficult.
5155;costa rica flavor;So much flavor for a bottled product! use on eggs, in salsas or in a sandwich.Brings back the joy of Costa Rica.
5156;I just started using Amazing Grass Green SuperFood;I have instantly noticed an increase in my energy and overall well being.  This makes it so convenient to get your greens regularly.
5157;Not really that dark;Good beans for the money but if you like it really strong like I do this is not the coffee for you. I actually have been blending in some french roast beans to darken my brew up.
5158;Wow!;I love this stuff!  I add 1/2 packet to 12 oz of skim milk, stir and add ice.  Delicious.
5159;The Barbecue are my favorite chips!!!;PopChips are the best potato chips I have ever had, hands down. The BBQ flavor is strong and tangy.
5160;Garden of Good Eating soy corn chips;I love these chips.  Nice alternative to the regular.
5161;Green Mountain Coffee Dark Magic;My husband enjoys this coffee so much, we're constantly running out
5162;Folgers Classic Roast is my favorite coffee;I've tried different brands, and different roasts, including gourmet coffees, but I always keep coming back to Folgers Classic.  To me, it offers a smooth, relatively full bodied flavor, without being overpowering or bitter.
5163;I love it;This is really good. The coffee tastes awesome!<br />It comes in a glass jar that you close it tightly so the coffee stays fresh longer.
5164;Not so tasty;After costco ran out of grade a thought I would try this. There is no comparing the grade A with this stuff.
5165;Smells nice, but...;These are nice smelling little towelettes, but very expensive..
5166;This product is not as advertised;The picture shows: cheese straws, a jar, fake grapes and fake leaves. None of these were included in the package.
5167;Hits the Spot;I add a shot or 2 on Sat am to get me motivated and this does the trick.  Tasty too.
5168;All Day Long;Enjoyable all times of the day. Just the right amount of salt and flavor.
5169;Great Mints;We've tried a variety of mints, Many are sharp and have an edge. Others are mild and lacking in flavor.
5170;Absolutely AMAZING;This oatmeal is unlike anything I've tasted before -- and I've eaten a lot of grains in my life.  The flavor is creamy and delicious -- absolutely amazing.
5171;Lady Grey a hit!;I have such a hard time finding loose tea locally. Being able to order my favorite Lady Grey tea on Amazon is convenient and timesaving.
5172;Better than Starbuck!;I love this mocha! With only 30 calories, one can't ask for a better drink, either hot or iced. I brought the box into work to share and they all love it.
5173;I LIKE IT;The first ones I got there was something wrong with the cans and they were almost impossible to open with the new can opener from Amazon.<br />But I tried them again and these are great and open more easily.
5174;NOT a Black Bean chip!;"Although labeled ""Black Bean Chips,"" unlike the (now unavailable) Trader Joe's version these are CORN chips with some black bean thrown in.  That's misleading."
5175;A lot of food compared to other Hormel Compleats Meals;Each meal consistently had a large piece of chicken breast that actually covered more that 3/4 the length of the package.  Also contained a substantial amount of potatoes in the package.
5176;Love Orgain;Just read the ingredients label..
5177;Surprising;I am not an organic person by any means..
5178;Patriotic Candy;I was very satisfied with my purchase.  This product was fresh and my guest appreciated the extra effort I put into my planning.
5179;Cat Sure;Pros: Great supplement for convalescing cats - vitamins, nutrients, and includes taurine.  Cons: only good for 3 days - but I have frozen it in ice cube trays and use it as needed.
5180;Green Mountain Coffee Breakfast Blend;A smooth light roast for your morning coffee break. This is my favorite blend, not too strong with excellent flavor.
5181;Amazing Service;The cookies came to me fine. The service was beyond my expectation.
5182;WASTE OF MONEY;I BOUGHT THIS FOR MY DOG AND HE TOOK ONE LOOK AT IT PLAYED WITH IT FOR A FEW MINUTES AND NEVER LOOKED AT IT AGAIN- IT WAS A WASTE OF MONEY..
5183;Good tea except for one thing...;It is a pretty good tea except they have licorice in it -- even in small amounts it is not appealing to me.<br />Raises some people's blood pressure, too, so it would be good to know this before purchasing.
5184;Love all HappyBaby Tots!;My kids (18 mo and 3 yrs) love the HappyBaby Tots.  We have tried every flavor and they eat all of them.
5185;My cats love this stuff  >^..^&lt;
5186;Excellent!;I could never handle pancakes even though I liked them on occasion because I would be hungry an hour later. Now that I found I am insulin resistant I tried these with Walden Farms sugar free syrup.
5187;Very good mint flavor!;This Peppermint Mocha is so delicious!  Mint mixed with chocolate is one of my top favorite combinations.  I agree with other reviewers that this doesn't really taste like coffee - in fact, it doesn't have any coffee flavor that I can tell at all.
5188;Okay coffee but cannot detect any vanilla;This coffee is okay but I am unable to detect any vanilla flavor either before or after brewing.  I also found the coffee to taste a little more bitter than most coffee blends.
5189;Mild but Satisfying;Chantea's Aloe Vera Green Tea (Passion Fruit) is a mildly flavored sweetened green tea with passion fruit flavor and bits of aloe vera.  The chunks of aloe vera are big enough to chew and add both texture and flavor to what would otherwise be a very bland drink.
5190;BIG DISAPPOINTMENT;I ordered the skim version of this product thinking it would cost me less Weight Watchers points. Well, it certainly accomplished that goal but the product is almost undrinkable.
5191;Beware!  Flavored Coffee...;It sure would be nice if they stated ANYWHERE in the description of this coffee that it is flavored.  I love the Bed and Breakfast coffee, it's just plain coffee, so I was surprised when I received the Jamaica coffee and it was flavored.
5192;Unsafe teething biscuits;This is my first review as a new mom but I felt I needed to alert parents that this product is not safe as a teething biscuit. I got this at Whole Foods supermarket for my 8-month old.
5193;Kid Friendly Tortilla Chips;These chips are just the right size and strength for dipping or snacking, especially for kids. They survive the trip to school in a lunch bag pretty well.
5194;Splenda in every flavor...tastes horrible;Wanted the Sodastream for my birthday.  Got it, made up the first cola.
5195;Amazing and Incredible product!;this is Amazing and Incredible tea! very versatile and drinkable all the time.<br />I'm a tea fanatic, but this one I'm drinking all the time.
5196;Excellent Low Sugar Sweet Treat;This almond product is wonderful!  I am so excited to have healthy options that curb my sweet tooth.  It has on 5 sugars for an ounce of almonds.
5197;Great Flavored Coffee;With a name like Chocolate Raspberry Truffle, Van Houtte's new k-cups already had my mouth watering.  The first taste lived up to my expectations.
5198;Wouldn't Go Without It;I've had frequent headaches, muscle cramps, and headaches since I was a child.  I have vivid memories of laying awake into the late hours of the night before exhaustion and sleep would settle in.
5199;Great marketing and packaging, but yuck!;This coffee looks great and this coffee sounds great, but it does not taste great!  It had several  off notes to it.  It was weak and bland.
5200;So much better than the 'mainstream' brand!;"I've been feeding these to my 10 month old as ""dessert"" for the past month or so, and he loves them.  I like them too, and have been known to pop one in my mouth when I'm putting them on his tray."
5201;Happy;Excellent! Package arrived on time..
5202;My dogs have rated Booda Bones 5 Stars!;I have three King Charles Cavalier Spaniels and they are picky, picky eaters even when it comes to Treats.  They love the peanut flavored Booda Bones and have one every day.
5203;Quality Food;First thing I did was check the ingredients.  No wheat and no corn.
5204;Thick and Rich;I have used dandruff shampoo for most of my life.  It seems as though I have tried most of the dandruff shampoos that exist.
5205;Makes me think of ...patchouli;The grittiness is forgiveable (somehow I feel better that it's less processed), the earthy taste is not a total turn-off but I feel calling it delicious is a stretch.  Of 3 different sweetners I tried with it, honey seemed best to neutralize the earthy aftertaste.
5206;Not Bad/Acually a wuick decent meal;The food is actually quick and decent.  Great for keeping on hand in an emergency or for a quick lunch.
5207;An essential kitchen spice;I love the Mediterranean Spiced Sea Salt!  I put it on just about everything to give my food extra flavor. It's great on vegetables, eggs, meat, potatoes, etc.
5208;Tropical Vacation in a cup;This tea is so good, it tastes almost like a pinacolada. The flavor is light and sweet.
5209;Sweet!;These are so much better than Gerber..
5210;No more gas;Boxers are known for being susceptible to gas. My Boomer is aptly named, but since switching to Wellness dry with about a third of a can of Wellness canned food, fed once  a day, he stays slim, energetic and blessedly flatulance-free.
5211;This is my new conditioner;I have problem hair. There's all kinds of textures in it, from thin and silky to fried and crinkled.
5212;Wanted to like it;It sounds delicious, but the taste is just too fruity, and not all that good tasting.  It just tastes weird, for lack of a better description.
5213;Perfect!;My husband and I are stationed overseas. I don't know what I would do without this amazing mix! I use it everyday for so many things.
5214;Bold coffee;To me, bold coffee like the extra bold espresso from Timothy's, is pleasing to my taste.  It's not harsh or bitter but has a pleasant satisfying taste.
5215;Ahhhhhhh, delicious.;I love this drink. I would rather drink crystal light beverages than just about anything else, and they're also much healthier than just about anything.
5216;My Dog Loves this Food;"My dog really enjoys this brand of food, and her ""poop"" seems a lot more solid and ""normal"" since I put her on it.  It is not a cheap brand, but it is very good quality, and my dog seems to love it."
5217;Excellent product but....;I love these crackers and they are every bit as good as other reviewers say, but I cannot justify this price. Some stores sell them for about five dollars per box but they're hard to find.
5218;Great Bold Coffee;This is outstanding French Roast Coffee, not for those who like their coffee weak and watery. This brews a full body cup.
5219;Had ball out in 2 minutes!;I just brought this home and gave it to my dog(cattle dog mix) and she literally had it out in 2 minutes flat. This is supposed to provide hours of interactive chewing challenge(as it states on packaging) but it didn't even give 5 minutes! I guess if your dog is a master chewed like mine, the extreme kong is a better choice.
5220;Beautiful Tasting Oil!;This oil has a smooth feel and a strong coconut scent and flavor. I use it for cooking and also for hair and body.
5221;OMG. Tastes really weird;For those of you who really want to explore different kinds of weird taste or test if your tongue is working properly, buy it. Otherwise you probably want to stay away from this stuff.
5222;Good taste and chewiness;I liked the taste and texture. However, one of my packages arrived with the vaccuum broken and the balls had turned to complete dust.
5223;Makes baby gassy!;My son liked the taste and has a nice thick texture.  But he was sooooo gassy after eating this there is no way I can feed him the rest that I bought.
5224;WORST THING I'VE EVER TASTED!!;One word sums it all up - HORRIBLE!  I'd comment on the texture but the particle board flavoring made all other attributes null and void.  Enough said.
5225;Loved them;Had these the other night.  Was amazed how great they were and how many I could eat for only 80 cals.
5226;I don't love it, my dog does!;Of the Zukes flavors, the New Zealand Rabbit is Pepper's favorite. In fact, she likes it almost too much.
5227;Great Product, Hands Down!;As a sports referee for Basketball and Lacrosse, I do a lot of running, stopping, changing directions in an instance. This takes a toll on bones, muscles and joints.
5228;Terrific;I love this stuff, and was able to provide it to my sister when she came down with gestational diabetes. As a major sugar fan and chocoholic, she said this helped the craving a little, while not affecting her blood sugar at all.
5229;Fresh and tasty Cayenne Pepper - generous amount and good value;As other reviewers have mentioned, cayenne pepper is also good to deter animals from getting into certain places. It has been good for cats, and smaller dogs, not so much for my curious Labrador who will smell and eat anything.
5230;Love these, but only got 11 of 12 packets.;When I opened the package, I only found 11 packets of the Honey Stingers. There should have been 12.
5231;"Fantastic ""Hot"" sauce with great flavor";The other reviews are classic examples of how taste varies. This is the same sauce that is used at Popeye's restaurants in the little packets.
5232;Not really a fan of this type of coffee;I am trying many different types of coffee, and I don't particularly enjoy this type.  Some people might but not me.
5233;Excellent snacks;I love this small, tasty cookies. They are my backup in office when I get hungry in the middle of work or I am late in launch.
5234;My puppy loves it and no allergy!;My puppy had very loos poops and lots of horrible gas. I tried W illness puppy food(dry and can), orijin puppy food, and blue buffalo.
5235;Maybe Biased;This might be a biased review, since I don't quite like pickles nor onions. However, I will comment on the taste as best as I can.
5236;Love it!  works great - grows fast and furious;My wife and I love the fresh salad greens kits, and also have had success with the salsa kits.  It's great to harvest for meals, and grows back quickly to replenish the stock.
5237;Delicous salty snack;"Its hard to stick to the rule of doing everything ""in moderation"" with these tasty snacks around. Salty, smokey, a wonderful and more nutritious alternative to potato chips."
5238;Less strong, but still delicious;"I have 12 flavors of Lorann Oils, and all of them are great. This one is more ""delicately"" flavored and hard to taste, and also harder to use (how often do you have an occasion for it, really?) but still delicious."
5239;best tasting coconut water;Zico 33.8 Ounce tastes so good, crisp and pure.
5240;misses the mark;This is a seitan (wheat protien) product with a strong anise (licorice) flavor that dominates the thai peanut taste. If you like black licorice, you may like this.
5241;Oat Meal Cookies;In order to get a great deal on Golden Syrup I had to get the 6 pick, just to make a batch of Oat Meal cookies.  This syrup is not bad at all, it's even good with regular oat meal.
5242;Ewwwww!!!!;Really?  Who blends this stuff and decides that it is good?  Ugh.  I can sum this nastyness up in one quick phrase.
5243;Comment on new box design...;I love this tea, but I find the new box design annoying.  I don't really like the photos on the boxes and I have gotten two different types, this one and the Hazelnut one and both of them had flaps that ripped and they don't stand upright like the other style did, the old style with no picture.
5244;What a treat!;I found this wonderful hot chocolate mix during a pre-Christmas shopping trip.  We really enjoyed it and when I went to buy more, I couldn't remember where I had purchased it.
5245;Brown Family Maple Syrup;This is an outstanding natural food product. I am trying to improve my diet and stay away from harmful food products like MGG and High Fructose corn syrup.
5246;LOVE LOVE LOVE the Almond Cashew with Flax;HATE HATE HATE the gooey mess I was just sent from Amazon.  It looked like it melted then firmed up a bit.
5247;works wonders!;My baby's doctors recommended this to increase milk supply. 610mg 3 times a day.
5248;Best Chips EVER!...and they're GOOD for you!;We found these at Costco and fell in love with them.  They're SO GOOD.
5249;Weak & watery - where is the coffee & hazelnut flavor?;I see that some reviewers also noted very weak coffee with these, yet some rave about it. I've only tried one box of the GJ's Hazelnut (won't be ordering more).
5250;Elegant;An elegant treat, unique in that it incorporates tiny pieces of crystallized ginger in a paper thin, crisp cookie. Absolutely the finest product of its kind.
5251;Not my favorite Green Mountain;I don't know if I got a bad batch but this coffee has a nasty plastic flavor. I think the Nantucket Blend is good and the Dark Magic is excellent.
5252;These pouches are great!;These pouches are so easy and convenient.  They taste great and are perfect for busy moms.
5253;tastes like perfumed soap;I am a daily herbal tea drinker. I prefer green teas, but also love red bush teas.
5254;our cats get diarrhea from this product;Our two cats eat a variety of non pate, chunky canned cat foods without any issue but this particular one seems to give them slight diarrhea.  This has happened with two separate orders.
5255;oatmeal cookies;What happened to the oatmeal cookies. You've been out of stock for months.
5256;Very drinkable alkaline water;"Without wading into the controversies surrounding the use of alkaline drinking water to improve body chemistry, I can share with you that this water is very drinkable in that it is largely indistinguishable from our tap water notwithstanding its ""ionization"" and the addition of electrolytes.  It did not upset my stomach or cause any other physical reaction, as is sometimes reported when using other alkaline water products."
5257;Horizon Organic Chocolate Milk;MMMMMMMMm, SOOOO delicious!<br />My sons love it! Milk's Carton fits great to their lunch bags.<br />Price is pretty acceptable considering that you don't have to:<br />1.
5258;Best chutney we've ever had;We enjoy curries - English and East Indian.  This chutney is the ideal addition!  We think curry just isn't the same without it.
5259;Gross!;Read the fine print before you buy this! I got it as a gift for a friend who is allergic to gluten but loves licorice. Turns out this is for 6 teeny tiny, barbie doll sized boxes of licorice.
5260;Love Chocolove;Best candybars. I was skeptical buying food online, but I can't get these anywhere near me except the Chocolate Show once a year in NYC.
5261;Its our Sunday Staple. Ten Stars!!;Living in the west this product has been very hard to find at times.<br />Now I order it from Amazon and keep over 100 boxes on hand in the basement.
5262;WAY better than I expected;The label says they're popped, rather than fried or baked.  However they did it, these are great chips!  They're very nicely seasoned such that I don't think you'd be inclined to dip them, though they're certainly sturdy enough to.
5263;Good Quality Bean, Stands Alone, Also Nice for Blending;BLEND this for a Great Smooth cup of Coffee! Easy to do.<br /><br />These coffee beans arrived quickly, however there were not in a vacuum packed pouch.
5264;Love these soups;Great for the busy person-throw in the crock pot in the morning with some protein (meat or more beans)-I can add anything like a can of Rotelle or fresh veggies, dried lentils.  I usually chop up 2 raw chicken breasts, add a can of rotelle, a hand full or lentils or black beans, any fresh veggies I have on had, and  put it all in my crock pot and when every one gets in that  afternoon or evening I have a FABULOUS stew that can serve a big crowd.
5265;CALM By Natural Vitality****A Must Have For Anyone!!!!!!****;I love this stuff!!!!!!! It works quickly, efficiently and tastes good too. It works for headaches, stress, mental disorders like Schizophrenia, ect.
5266;Great for pukey cat;My cat was born in August 2001, so he's almost 10 years old. Three years ago he started to throw up quite frequently.
5267;Best you can buy for your best friend;Great product loved by my buddies, my dogs Bait and Milady!!!!! They look forward to their special treats. Great for their health ,too.
5268;Great holdover snack;These cookies are high in fiber and make a great holdover snack in-between meals. Like Nana's other cookies, these are not very sweet.
5269;HORRIBLE doesn't begin to describe this product!  Very disappointed!;"The product description says: ""Keta Salmon Caviar is from the select roe of the Keta Salmon, which has very large eggs with a color that can range from bright red to brilliant orange.""<br /><br />The caviar I received consisted of really small eggs (about half the size of those at a sushi restaurant) that are mushy, and taste awful."
5270;Delicious, unique tea;This is a full-bodied tea with ginger. It's substantial and satisfying--a great coffee substitute.
5271;"Ghost Chili, A Real ""Ghost""";Dear Ladies/Gentlemen
5272;Buyer Beware - Can't Return This Product;My wife ordered this, so I'm not sure if she was aware that this product came from China.  When we got the pkg and learned that this was from China, we wanted to return it.
5273;Absolutely delicious and satisfying;This item came up in a gold box recommendation and I took a chance.  While a bit more expensive than the Cliff Bars I had been buying, these were an absolute treat and I plan to purchase more.
5274;Delicious!;This is a great product.  We had been drinking Vitamin Water (which we still love) but needed to reduce the amount of sugar.
5275;Pheweee. No way. And these are chicken! Controversial brand losing even more ground here.;"This brand has been implicated in the big ""Chinese chicken"" dangerous dog treats disaster. That's enough to condemn these treats."
5276;"Giant Pez ""Joe Cool"" Snoopy";It's giant pez Snoopy.  Dispenses Pez candy rolls.
5277;This Is the Way to Go ...;..
5278;smooth and mild;I don't like bitter or strong coffee, so this blend is perfect for me.  It has a nice coffee taste without being too strong.
5279;Breathsavers;I love Breathsavers Peppermint, not too bitterly strong and not overpoweringly sweet. My job involves talking a lot, and sometimes, it's inconvenient to be swilling down water every five minutes, and these mints do an excellent job.
5280;Love it!;My son loves these and like to feed himself with them. Wish I would have invented them!  Going to order more very soon.
5281;Rooster Sauce;"I first discovered this sauce as the ""secret ingredient"" from my favorite restuarant's hot wing recipe, they called it Rooster Sauce because of the Rooster on the label.  I now use in my hot wing sauce recipe."
5282;Best Chips Out There!;These are my new favorite!  I have always been a fan of salt and vinegar but these honey dijons have replaced them as my new number one!  They do have a strong taste so loving the honey mustard flavor is a must if you hope to like these.<br /><br />Price wise.
5283;KarenG;Nutiva coconut oil is the best there is.  I have tried many different brands over the years and by far Nutiva has the best flavor, consistency and price that I have found.
5284;Great GF crust!;This is an excellent gluten-free pizza crust.  When I decided to go gluten-free I knew I would miss pizza the most, but this crust is a great replacement.
5285;The Perfect Power Booster;I often use this KIND Plus Cranberry Almond Bar as lunch.  Why?  Because it is the perfect all-natural combination of proteins and fruit, is gluten free, and delivers 50% of the DV Antioxidants Vitamin A, C and E.
5286;Miracle;I have three dogs, and one of them kept having bouts of diarrhea.  My vet gave her antibiotics and other prescription drugs to resolve the problem.
5287;Excellent, easy to make cake and cookies;A very good mix, easy to prepare  as a basic gingerbread and also a great base for additions  and variations (I sometimes make it with applesauce).<br />I made this with chopped dried fruit and a touch of brandy for a holidau  coffee cake and have added cinnamon,cardamom, and cloves to the mix for a spice cake that is a huge hit.
5288;My Favorite- for blueberry lovers;This is my favorite kind bar. It has a nice blueberry taste.
5289;Great Deal If You're Hooked On Starbucks Coffee!;My local grocery store charges $9.95 per 12 oz bag of French Roast which is the only Extra Bold Starbucks which they sell.
5290;Timothy's coffee pods for the Keurig machine;We love the Timothy's extra bold rainforest<br />expresso coffee  After trying many of the Keurig brands,<br />we found this bold, velvety coffee is the best!<br />We also use their decaf in the evening.<br />Great coffees works well on subscribe and<br />save program.
5291;great treat, but too expensive;okay, it's freeze-dried liver cube-lets.  my common sense tells me that for a lot less than the price of this treat i could buy real liver, cube it and freeze it.
5292;Spice up your world!;I tried a demo of Tasty Bite Entree Madras Lentils in a supermarket, and absolutely fell in love with it. Everything in it is healthy stuff, and it's a wonderful thing to use as a topping for baked potatoes or rice.
5293;Great Looking!;These sprinkles make a great presentation and are tasty too!  Used them for my french chocolate balls.  Would recommend them highly.
5294;Great pantry item;I stock up on these broths via subscribe and save and they're a huge convenience to have in my pantry.  It's so much easier to throw together a soup, make a casserole, or reduce a sauce with one or two of these pouches on hand.
5295;Great product;Love these noodles! Great when you want a big bowl of pasta but not the calories. Only issue is that they smell awful!  Taste great ,just have to rinse them well to get rid of the smell.
5296;bad choice;Was told by an employee in a pet store that this brand is one of the best. Bought from them and then purchased at Amazon (cheaper).
5297;Finally the help your dog needs!;I have a lot of hope using this food for my dogs skin allergies and ear infections. This company has the BEST costumer service I've ever had in an online shopping experience.
5298;Better than starbucks!;When Starbucks quit making tassimo disks, I thought I would have to throw away my coffee maker.  Instead I gave Kenco a try based on a good review.
5299;All gone already?!;My son eats these vegatables with no problem. These were his 1st solid foods after Earth's Best rice cereal.
5300;Bliss is an accurate description.;I love Cacao Bliss.  It is a sweet treat right out of the jar by the spoonful.
5301;If you like Jack Links, then this is a great deal;You can count on Jack Links to provide a tasty, consistent-quality product. This Mega Pack is a great value, too.
5302;So close to the real thing!;YAY! These gluten free graham crackers are superb! They are thicker than the normal graham crackers that most people are used to but you quickly adapt. We like them just plain, out of the box but they also make great s'mores.
5303;Great source of fiber;I was thankful when Bakery on Main came out with this product, as it is so difficult to find tasty, high fiber GF cereals/granolas.  I like the cinnamon taste and enjoy eating it on top of yogurt.
5304;It reduced puffy eyes for me!;I really like this eye cream. I used department store brands for years, but have been trying to reduce the amount of chemicals I put on my skin, and so turned to 100% Pure.
5305;Well...;I would not give this a 1 star but I would not give it a 5 star either. I am thinking 2 1/2 is fair.
5306;Almonds and Brazil nuts...;If you like handfuls of almonds this might be the perfect mix. I love almonds and don't mind getting more than a few in every handful.
5307;Truly the best!;As someone who has been at this for a very long time..
5308;Bad product containers;This item contains four tins of Colman,s Mustard. Each tin was leaking and two of the tins had no sell by date.
5309;Great quality healthy dog food;I am very pleased with this product.  I have 6 dogs and they love it.
5310;Good Noodles;i practically lived off these stuff during my college years.<br /><br />they're one of the best instant noodles i've ever had.
5311;Not same as Kroger brand Cinnamon Cream creamer;I purchased this creamer hoping that it would be the same flavor as the Kroger brand of Cinnamon Cream non-dairy creamer that was recently discontinued.  It is good, but is not exactly the same as the discontinued Kroger brand - so not a direct substitute.
5312;Zesty;I usually buy orange and lemon zest for cooking, when I don't make my own. I decided to get this for a new toothpaste recipe I picked up.
5313;One of my toddler's favorites;This is another one of my daughter's favorite snacks.  She seems to prefer the varieties with pears in them, and I do like that is is getting some spinach and that she actually likes it!  She does prefer the Peas, Broccoli, & Pear flavor, but this is also a favorite.
5314;are they making CC out of gold now?;$22 for 2 bags of cereal? that averages to more than 5 dollars per 10 ozs..
5315;Brewt Tea Brewer;We are tea aficionados and we have tried everything. The Brewt is the best, we love it.
5316;Very Good Beef Jerky;Oberto has the best flavor of all the beef jerkies I have tasted.  Better than Jack Links, Wal Marts or a local brand I tried.
5317;First Rate Quality;These beans were really fresh and lower cost than other suppliers.  The beans were shipped free and promptly.
5318;What more do you want?;The taste isn't great, but you can get used to it (I mix mine in water).  I am a vegan and I don't like eating a lot of soy (I think it may upset my stomach).
5319;I love Moroccan Mint;Stash is my favorite tea, and by far the Moroccan Mint is my favorite flavor.  I love mint, and the mix of green tea and mint is just delcious.
5320;Very sweet.;I'm not complaining about this.  I think this item is great.
5321;Fantastic blend;This is a great tea packed with caffeine and complex flavors. It even works well iced! It's a great example of how some black teas can be re-steeped as many as 6 times before losing their flavor.
5322;Ferrero Raffaello Almond Coconut Treat Candy;This is the best candy I've ever eaten..
5323;Good Quick Meal;The soup is pretty flavorful and almost tastes like restaurant quality. I usually add water above the line because it still tastes good and not watered down.
5324;It tastes really good.;I have tried many types of noodles and vermicellies and this one by far the best one. It is very easy to prepare (only took me about 20 minutes to get my meal ready).
5325;Pamela's Flour;This is exactly what I wanted. It is much cheaper to buy it this way and not through a store.
5326;Decent variety.;I read many of the reviews of this product before purchasing.  I have to agree with many of the other reviews.
5327;excellent superlight substitutes for palmiers;Many of Bahlsen's cookies are too sweet and floury for my taste, but these light flaky cookies don't taste stale and are not too rich but are nice and do not taste like sugared cardboard.  I don't crave these but when you eat them, you realize that these are better than the average boxed cookies and unexpectedly delicate and fresh tasting given the supermarket price.
5328;Harney and Sons makes wonderful teas;Paris tea by Harney and Sons has a medium boldness. Sweet, with kind of a vanilla and caramel flavor to it.
5329;Great for Earl Grey lovers!;I first ran across the Double Bergamot by accident.  I love Earl Grey, and I have enjoyed many other Stash teas in the past (if you haven't tried the Chocolate Hazelnut yet, go order some now.
5330;Bad taste and worse aftertaste;This product is absolutely not to my taste.  It is advertised as a carbonated juice drink, so I kinda expected something along the lines of Welch's Sparkling Grape Juice
5331;Felidae saved my cat!;My 10 year old cat was on the brink of death about a year ago, when my vet theorized he might be allergic to the grain in his Science Diet food. When we put him on Felidae Salmon formula he recovered and is now more healthy than he has been in years.
5332;"My favorite vegetarian ""meat"" product";I grew up on this stuff. It's so quick and easy to use.
5333;Pretty good, but seemed to go stale;I found that about a month before the expiration date these tasted stale to me.  So have several bags left from the case I bought that are not that good anymore.
5334;Better value elsewhere;The old saying buyer beware comes to mind as i review this product. while the sweetner itself is a good product, it does not represent the best value for the money.
5335;Dog ate toy;I got this toy for my 8 mo old pit bull.She took the chew thing out and chewed the ball up.
5336;Tea may have been adulterated;This stuff hardly had any stimulating effect at all even when I went up to two rounded tablespoons per serving.  It also didn't taste so bitter unlike what people say about ephedra.
5337;Parents;Ordered this for my parents at christmas time and they had me order it for them again they enjoyed it so much. Every flavor and brand has a lot to offer.
5338;makes perfect espresso;I tried a bunch of the small roasters amazon sells and the most gracious I can be is that they are inconsistent.<br /><br />Lavazza Super Crema is fantastic espresso.
5339;Delicious!;Orange Tangerine Switch is a crisp carbonated citrus beverage. Unlike its sugar-laden brethren, Switch doesn't leave a sticky film in your mouth after you've finished drinking it, presumably because there isn't any sugar added to the drink.
5340;addicted to sugar in the raw;i like to use products that have the least amount of processing and this fits the bill perfectly. I love the large,easily dissolved crystals and the molasses imparts a hearty sweet flavor, especially in black teas.
5341;Excellent for those using lots of onion powder;I purchase McCormick brand 4.5 ounce containers at my military grocery store for almost exactly this price.
5342;Please keep in stock, best olives on the planet;these are the best green olives on the planet. i buy cases of these.
5343;A great plain tea;I have been looking for just a pain black tea with no flavors.  I finally found it.
5344;Confident in the food;I feel good using this food. My schnauzer was having minor food allergies and I had trouble finding food without grains and by-products  The price was good and even better with the auto order and free shipping.
5345;Has a really odd taste and aftertaste;I'm usually a big fan of Starbucks' bagged coffees and of flavored coffees in general, but this one just has an odd taste and aftertaste to it.  It doesn't even really taste like vanilla to me -- just like some kind of flavored hot beverage.
5346;Takes you back!;"Everyone who tastes it says, ""Oh yeah - This is what Coke used to taste like.""<br />Wonderful on a hot day when chilled so well that the bottle ices when opened."
5347;great northern popcorn;I have tried other brands of popcorn for our machine and great northern is the best.Everyone always likes it.
5348;Rather expensive, but...;..
5349;Pretty good but not crispy enough.;These peanuts are very good in terms of having the right amount of salt and the size of each nut is good, but I was disappointed in the lack of crunch from them. I was hoping for the nuts to be very crispy/crunchy since they are kettle cooked, but they weren't, at least not enough for me to justify the price they are charging.
5350;Awesome!;If you like goldfish crackers these will satisfy you for a while. I have bought this box 3 times and eat them.
5351;Most Decadent Truffles EVER;These truffles were everything they should have been: rich, creamy, chocolaty, with a hint of sweetness.  It's nearly impossible to eat more than 2 or 3 without a strong cup of bitter coffee.
5352;perfect!;These are the perfect treats for training. My dog loves them and because they are moist and so tiny I don't feel bad about giving him multiple treats for completing tricks or good behavior.
5353;Wonderful tea!;This is the best tea I've ever had.  It is mild with no bitter after taste.
5354;Tasty;I love this tea.  I keep an iced pitcher in the fridge at all times
5355;Good night sleep;I purchased these tea bags in hope for a good night sleep. The first night I drank it, I slept great.
5356;Good but Not Better;These granola bars with peanut butter mini-chips, a drizzle of chocolate over the grain, and a bottom layer of chocolate taste good.  It is a touch sweet and the chocolate isn't very strong compared to the peanut butter flavor but it has a good amount of whole grains and those are decently crunchy but not hard.
5357;I love this tea;I love this tea.I didn't order it for the appetite suppressant ,but it really does help.
5358;Tasty and seems to work;I thought these were worth a try, and in fact I was a little surprised that over the course of a few days, they do indeed seem to work.  The taste is good too, with some sweetness from the liquorice and even a pleasant hint of curry (I think from the fenugreek), which is better than it sounds.
5359;Great;So far there haven't been any worms in my rice though I've only opened a couple of the boxes. Besides just being boxed up, the rice has a thick plastic bag protecting it from any worms.
5360;San Francisco Bay Coffee for Keurig Brewer;San Francisco Bay Coffee OneCup for Keurig K-Cup Brewers, French Roast, 12-Count (Pack of 3)That is 36 K-Cups. I was worried when they looked different than the other cups.
5361;Excellent product.;I use this to keep my blood level stable all day, it works great, but taste awful. i usually mix it with some naked Juice and that helps a lot.
5362;Lipton Black Tea;Arrived fast and undamaged. I love my lipton tea.
5363;Kick Start;I purchased this coffee for when I wanted to made double runs with my coffee maker.  For large cup sizes you can do a 10oz and then lift the lift like a new cup has been added and then do a 4oz or 8 oz on top of the orginal 10 oz.
5364;Best brownie mix;I purchased this item at my local grocery store a few months ago and immediately checked Amazon to see if they offered it.  My family says these are the best!  They're rich, chocolaty, chewy, easy to make --and did I mention chocolaty?  I know there are other flavors I haven't tried yet but I'm betting they are also great.
5365;Pleasantly surprised;"So I saw this at my local Target and thought I'd give it a shot.  I almost decided not to because generally I haven't liked anything but the ""double"" sized T-Discs from Starbucks and the new Gevalia ones that are decent."
5366;My puppy loves it more without the rope attached.;My large puppy (8 mo., 70 lbs, Doberman/Am.
5367;not perfect but better than the rest;although this isn't a perfect cup of cocoa, it's far superior to the others that i have tried. i will order this again.
5368;Kenyan AA;After Green Mountain decided to discontinue everyone's favorite K-Cup flavor, Expresso, Kenyan AA came the closet as a replacement.  If Green Mountain does not revive the Expresso flavor, I will go back to Melita Columbian brewed in a conventional drip coffee maker.
5369;The Best Sugar Cubes;First of all huge thanks to Amazon. I ordered the cubes on 8/23 and they arrived 8/23, WOW!<br /><br />I have been buying the La Perruche brown sugar cubes for years.
5370;Great homemade popcorn;Thank you for the fast delivery of my order, the 6lb bag of Midnight Blue popcorn. It popped on the stovetop just fine, although I think this company also sells a popper, which we haven't purchased.
5371;Love It!!!!!;I absolutely love this product.  I bought it because I just went natural and I have to say that this oil is the best.
5372;Not even close to what I hoped for;I can eat just about anything, but these went down the garbage disposal.  I followed instructions and used pasta sauce on them, couldn't eat them.
5373;Tastes Great;I prefer the taste of this over the alcohol-based vanilla extracts, particularly in uncooked items and beverages. It has a fairly thick/syrupy consistency.
5374;It is a winner!;This is my first purchase from Trappist and it will not be my last.  The berry variety pack is very good.
5375;poor quality of product --great customer service;We have ordered this item before and have been quite pleased.  This time, the product quality was lousy!  Sardines were very hard and had a funny taste.
5376;A great tea for the money.;This tea is very mild and really does taste great and I could definitely see myself drinking this everyday. I mainly use loose leaf teas, but find tea bags useful for the office or if I'm in need of a quick fix.
5377;Not good;It smelled bad and my dogs poop turned white within hours of being deposited. I think the ingredient quality is questionable.
5378;Made in the USA and Delicious!;Excellent protein powder, GF, organic and allergen free. It also has an excellent amino acid and protein profile.
5379;Great stock up item;"I bought this as kind of a food storage ""survival"" item, but we keep eating it.  It seems that having a case of tuna on hand is good when you haven't been able to get to the grocery store for a while, or someone just wants something different or a quick snack."
5380;Awful taste;I dont like the taste of this at all.  I have some other fennel tea from another company not on amazon and it is fantastic.
5381;If you have cats, don't bother;Although theoretically these small bags are ideal --- waste from six cats fills up about three bags per day, the litter scoop fits easily into the opening, and these bags are easier to deal with than sandwich bags --- unfortunately they're not strong enough to deal with the weight of wet litter clumps. They stretch out just in being carried from pan to pan and occasionally rip and fall (usually in the litter pan, thank goodness).
5382;These are great!;Got these for my kids as Christmas stocking stuffers.  They love them.
5383;When you need a lift or help with motion sickness;Uncle Lee's Tea can be difficult to find where I live.  I keep some of this tea a work.
5384;Product not sealed;This product arrived and I found it a little odd that a liquid food product such as this is not encased in a cellophane shrink wrapping.  Then I opened the top and found that there was not even a seal across the top of the bottle.
5385;Great product, but carries a bad odor;I have the Beaba baby food maker and two of the trays.  I also use my food processor to make food.
5386;OMG! These Are Good;I normally HATE fake chips.  I don't even really like real chips, but if I'm having a chip, I don't want any of those taro, cassava whatevertheheck kind of chips.
5387;Great herbal tea;Do you love the taste of licorice? If so, this tea is for you. I used to be able to buy it from retail grocery stores but they no longer carry it.
5388;"SF Bay ""Fog Chaser""";This is my second favorite flavor from SFBC.  Breakfast blend is still the best.
5389;Great value for a good quality jerky;Great item to do Sub & Save on so you can keep a healthy snack on hand for work, school or just at home. Teriyaki is my personal favorite.
5390;Bumble Bee Lemon Pepper Tuna;I eat a different variety of the tuna kits everyday at work.  This is my least favorite, but it still tastes good and is a quick snack in between meals.
5391;yummy in pink;I've been making food for my 7.5 month daugher.
5392;Great BBQ sauce;Virginia Gentlemen BBQ sauce is good on its own (just a little bit of heat and not too sweet). It's also good as a starting point if you want to mix up your own hot sauce.
5393;Tea, tea everywhere;Having always had trouble finding loose PG Tips in the US, I finally popped for this multipack, and have no complaints--it arrived quickly, and was well-packaged and fresh-tasting, not to mention a good bargain. Of course, about a month later, my local grocer started stocking loose PG Tips.
5394;Yum!;The Moroccan Mint Green Tea by Stash is simply delightful.  I generally enjoy 1-3 cups a day (considering I have six boxes to consume) and each one is delicious.
5395;Sour Smell emailed company;I received the Zukes Chicken Mini's a couple of days ago. I opened the bag and the smell that came out of it was a sour almost vinegar smell, much like pickles in away.
5396;Great on-the-go meal;I am a mom of 3 kids. My youngest is always on the go as we take her older siblings to their sports practices and games.
5397;good stuff;this red clover tea is worth my money, i have shed 8 pounds in 3 weeks, i know its not a diet tea or anything but, i drink this twice a day eat my 3 regular small meals, and a fruit or a rice cake or something lowfat, the tea coupled with better<br />eating habits and i ride my exercise bike and do a few stretches, lunges, lift a 5 pound weight in sets of 5's twice, for<br />about 15 minutes total2 times a day, nothing long and drawn out. before 3 weeks ago i honestly weighed 199, that's a lot of weight if you are 5'2, mostly in my butt and thighs.
5398;YUMMIEST;I bought the five LBS bag from a different retailer and they smell like sulfur and do not taste like mango a all.  These are great!  They are chewy and tast like mango.
5399;Good deal but close expiration date!;I love this sea salt & vinegar flavor from Kettle.  When I saw this one on the daily deal here for $17.
5400;Long time Splenda user.;I am already a long time Slenda user, so I was happy to try another one of their products. Any vitamins that can be added to the product only makes it more attractive.
5401;BEST HOT COCOA YET;This is by far the best hot cocoa I have found yet for the Keurig. I love the assortment and the peppermint is my favorite.
5402;Highland Farms has better flavor than Coombs;I tried Coombs syrup just after Highland Farms and before Chafee Farm's. Coombs had a mildly unpleasant burnt caramel taste that I didn't care for in comparison, though it was fine used in recipes.
5403;I love this product!;All I can say is I love Lakerol Special Menthol Liqorice throat drops.  I hope this product will always be available through Amazon.
5404;For Environmentally Concerned Pet Owners;We have a greyhound that can put out a lot of poo to be disposed of. I was concerned about the amount of plastic bags we were using and adding to land fills.
5405;This is the tea that converted me from coffee;And I was drinking good coffee too. This is my absolute favorite tea.
5406;Peanut butter for the chubby set;Does it taste like a full fat peanut butter? No. Is the consistency the same as a full fat peanut butter? No.
5407;terrible, chemical-like flavor;OK, so I'm spoiled by Gevalia's German Chocolate Cake coffee. (Unfortunately, they only have theirs seasonally).
5408;Great Flavor;I have tried a couple of flavors and the cheddar is by far my favorite.  The Sour Cream/Onion has an off-putting sweet yet salty powder.
5409;Kind of grainy;I'm sorry, but i just had to go back and update my review. The over flow of reviews saying how great the taste is, is true to the people who have been drinking this kind of product for awhile.
5410;Delicious!;"Love these cookies! When I learned a couple of years ago that I was heading toward diabetes and needed to cut out as much sugar as I could I knew I needed a ""sweet"" substitute.  I tried various products and found Murray Sugar Free cookies."
5411;No Aspartame!;Only chewing gum I can find that does not contain Aspartame!<br />(If I am wrong, please let me know)<br />Check this site [..
5412;Goji Berries;They have sent me 2 bags with no labels on it. Kind of weird.
5413;Horrible purchase;The worst tea we have ever had the misfortune of drinking. Tasted like dishwater.
5414;Where is the CORRECT list of ingredients?;UPDATE! BEWARE FALSE advertising.<br />Received the case of INKA and found the advertisement is FALSE.
5415;Very enjoyable decaf;I've tried several of the Coffee Bean Direct decafs, and this is probably my favorite. Smooth flavor, but with enough depth to make it interesting.
5416;Best Muesli Ever;This gem of a cereal from England is so hard to find in the US - and if you do find it it's outrageously expensive. This 6-pack was great value.
5417;great option;I think Fruity Cheerios is a great alternative to some of the sweet kid's cereals on the market.  A serving has 9 grams of sugar which turns out to be a lot less than many of the kid's cereals out there.
5418;Great product, great price.;I tried Grove Square Cappuccino when I was in Washington state and enjoyed it tremendously. After returning to my home in Montana, I found it was unavailable here.
5419;Yeah;Need an emergency boost in the middle of the day? Yeah this is the stuff..
5420;Can't get enough!;To be honest, I haven't tried these, but if my dogs could type, they would give this stuff 10 stars.<br />Just noticed from doing this review that this stuff may be made in China?  If so, I won't buy again.
5421;Yummy Vegetable soup;To me, this is the best vegetable soup I ever had.  After eating this, no other will do.
5422;Great oil for baking with;love this stuff although it's not HOT enough so I'll be seeking a more concentrate product. I'm sure that there's some hotter cinnamon oil out there.
5423;Good Coffee!;My wife and I both thought this is a nice cup of coffee. The bag has a one-way valve on it to keep the air out and arrived virtually flat.
5424;Great deal for lots less;Same great bully sticks sold for so much more everywhere else.  My Shorkie loves them and spends hours working on them.
5425;creamy delicious;great 2nd stage food for my baby.<br />It's also great for adding other stuff into it when you want to introduce more density food for your baby because it's quite running.
5426;Surprisingly nice crunch;These look like shredded wheat cereal but taste completely different. The texture is light and very crunchy.
5427;Great chips and a great rpice!;Got my first order of these last week and have ordered four more for friends who keep raving about them! I usually buy these sort of chips at Trader Joe's or Whole Foods but the price and convenience of ordering from Amazon can't be beat. These chips have a great flavor to them and arrived in perfect condition.
5428;The Best Granola;This is the best granola I have ever had, I love how it has large chunks of fruit and nuts.  It's great when I am on the run and need some energy.
5429;Oh, wow.;Like a number of other reviewers I found these at costco. Immediate impression was that these are really wonderful tasting and the crunch gave me satisfaction that I was really chewing something up.
5430;the best raw honey on the web;I buy this raw honey all the time.Great taste very hard to find in market & if you do they want over 5.
5431;maltese owner;these are beef LUNGS..
5432;Starbucks Sumatra - a hit!!!;Delicious bold flavor without bitterness. Smooth with dark smokey undertones.
5433;Wonderful first food...;"My son started on solids at 4 months and I wanted to give him healthy, organic first foods before I decided if I would do the whole ""make my own baby food"" thing.."
5434;Very tasty!;The Cashew Cookie is my favorite flavor of the Larabar.  Very tasty!  I have Crohn's Disease and am on the SCD diet.
5435;Naturally tasty;Got these on time and they taste great. Product label shows all natural ingredients and no artificial ingredients.
5436;in-store 82 cents vs. 59 cents for 50-pack;In preparation for an international trip, where coffee quality would be uncertain, I bought a 12-pack at our local Starbucks store.  I like the quality and convenience so much that I use them at home.
5437;The best thing for cat's teeth;Although it may seem just a tad precious, our vet recommended this for a young cat who doesn't brush.  He has clean teeth, fresh breath, and I hope will have all his teeth all his life.
5438;Very Effective;My veterinarian recommended these.  My dog is a German Shepherd, Pit Bull, Jack Russel mix.
5439;Very nice..mild;Finally a product in a price range that I can say WoW about!If your looking for a product that delivers positive results that isnt 80 to 100$, I swear this is it. I have combo skin and some light scars around mouth/chin area from acne.
5440;Lives up to its appealing name;This is my favorite K-cup coffee (I've tried about twenty different types) and, so far, everyone I've served it to really likes it a lot. Even the pickiest coffee connoisseur I know thought this k-cup made an excellent cup of coffee.
5441;Has an unpleasant taste....;I was disappointed in the quality of this coffee.  It has a weird whang to it - a bitter taste.
5442;My cats love it;I have an Siamese and an Oriental Shorthair.  Their coats are much shinier since I switched them to this food, and they both like it.
5443;Cereal Marshmallows - ummmmmm;After opening up my last box of Lucky Charms and finding out that my daughter had eaten most of the marshmallows out of the box, I decided to try this product. I am so impressed!  The marshmallows are just like those in the Lucky Charms cereal!!! Now we don't need to fight over who is getting the marshmallows 
5444;most delicious coffee and candy combination;Biting into a Pocket Caffe is a surprise and a pleasure.  The interior expresso blends with dark chocolate in your mouth.
5445;my dog loves them;these are good for your dogs teeth.  they sell them at most vet offices for more.
5446;Fun, but way too pricey for the size!;"I ordered these to have at my son's Harry Potter birthday party.  The kids had fun eating them and trying to guess what ""nasty"" flavor each one was."
5447;Not good;I was really excited about these but they didn't taste good at all.  They left a terrible aftertaste in my mouth.
5448;Tastes just OK but what's in it?;"The new ""Dark Chocolate"" flavor of Kellogg's Special K granola bars tasted OK out of the box. The texture was a little grainy, but not in a whole-grain sort of way."
5449;good coffee;I was really impressed with this coffee, it has a nice bold taste, yet a smooth<br /> finish. I would order this coffee again.
5450;Re : Good deal for what it is;For the price and being a microwavable quick meal it is a good deal. It is certainly not for everyone's taste.
5451;Not worth buying on Amazon!!!!!!!!;Everytime I get this shipment delivered, the cans are broken and the food leaked out and there are bugs everywhere. I have to throw away part of the the shipment and go through the disgust and hassle of cleaning it up.
5452;You won't be sorry...;This product does exactly what it says it will for you. It especially helped with my anxiousness and body tension.
5453;quite different almond butter, too much like peanut butter!;I love almond butter, and was excited to try Barney Butter based on all the positive reviews--but was really disappointed when I received the product. I don't usually write reviews, but Barney Butter is quite different from any other almond butter, so thought I would share:<br /><br />1) it's very watery/oily/runny, with large chunks of what appear to be blanched almonds--stirring it up didn't help the consistency
5454;Delicious Tea;I buy this for my teenager. She loves it as hot tea.
5455;I am a little unhappy;I have been purchasing this product for over a year and lately my jerky is hard as a rock. I have been feeling like my over $30.
5456;Really for bigger dogs;I didn't realize this was so big until I got it.  I ended giving it to my Fiance's mom for her GSD.
5457;This is a favorite of mine;This is a favorite of mine, mainly because I like the flavor and I think the noodles hold up better than most.  It is not health food, too much sodium and fat, so if that is what you are after look else where.
5458;Best almond butter ever;We have searched everywhere for a delicious almond butter that's peanut free since my son has a major peanut allergy.  Finally!  And the whole family loves it - soon after I ordered our first 3 pack I was back to Amazon for more and have even ordered some for extended family.
5459;These pouches are great!;These pouches are so easy and convenient. They taste great and are perfect for busy moms.
5460;Salty;I had high expectations but it was extremely salty and tasted nothing like movie theater popcorn. Next time I try popping it ( I do have 23 more packs to go through) I'll try cutting back on the salt in the packet.
5461;Thank you, Riedel!;I have been enjoying single malt scotch since back in the '70's. For a long time the selection available here in the States was quite limited.
5462;"OK, but just a ""cup of coffee""";A cup of store-brewed Starbucks Breakfast Blend has always been my favorite cup of coffee. Even when I brewed (regular brewing) it at home I couldn't get the quite same taste, but I could get close enough.
5463;meets my son in law's approval;I keep this strength on hand for my coffee connoisseur son-in-law.  He voices his approval , stating that it is strong, flavorful and not bitter.
5464;my cat will eat all their flavors;She was picky before but after I started to put her on a diet she started eating every flavor. She hasn't lost any weight yet but she enjoys her meals.
5465;Good Season's Caesar Dressing Mix;I've used this powdered dressing mix both as a salad dressing and a marinade for chicken. One of the things I like about it is that you don't need to use nearly as much oil for the marinade as is called for on the package directions.
5466;great peach flavored black tea;As a previous reviewer stated,this tea is a wonderful balance of peach flavor and black tea.I am a traditional tea drinker and could never tolerate those 'fruitty' herbal teas as they are not really tea at all.
5467;Love Bold Coffee;Very fast shipping, this is one of my favorite Senseo coffees.  Just the perfect bold flavor.
5468;A very fun gift!;We gave these to my husband's family members for Christmas. They were a big hit! It is good quality chocolate and a nice variety of liquors.
5469;LOVE this stuff!;Our chiropractor recommended Natural Calm for more muscle relaxation and deeper sleep - and my entire family takes it.  We've adjusted the dose for our 10 y/o downward (1/4 t.
5470;The Best;This is the best beef jerky that I have found (aside from and elderly man that sells his homemade jerky once a year from a road-side stand). This is exactly what I want in a jerky.
5471;YUMMY!!!!;These pumpkin seeds were really, really good.  I used to only eat sunflower seeds and had tried eating pumpkin seeds before but did not like them.
5472;Wonderful coffee at a great price;Only coffee I want to drink.  Great taste and always frest with a price that just can't be beat.
5473;pretty good;I was desperately in need of these in the shell but they were a little pricey and although not super stale were not the freshest (I bought them way out of season). Served the purpose when purchased though.
5474;Meh;Was expecting more, but not quite sure why. Not terrible, and at least there's nothing too sinister in it.
5475;Cats love the food, but no pull-tab top, and dented cans.;I appreciate being able to buy this larger, more economical size from Amazon.  However, I didn't examine the picture closely enough, because I was surprised to see that the cans were not pull-tab and I had to dig out a can opener.
5476;Great Buy!  Great Coffee!;"These k-cups are a terrific price, and ""green"" as you're saving on packaging.  This hazelnut flavor is our favorite, as it's subtle, not overwhelming, just delicious."
5477;My dog loves them;My dog is actually a little picky when it comes to treats. He loves these though, and I don't have to feel guilty about giving him several throughout the day because they are very low in calories.
5478;Great for cats with allergies!;My cat has food allergies and I was paying for expensive prescription cat food that he didn't like at all. I worked with him until I found the Purina One Chicken and Oatmeal, he likes it and it doesn't make him itch! We've used it for some time now and he seems to be doing well.
5479;Jerky Naturals Dog Treats.Lamb 6oz.;This is very good dog treat. Our Chihauhua loves them.
5480;Healthy Treats;My dogs absolutely love these treats - we get them in salmon, duck and chicken.  There is nothing they won't do to get one!  If they are ignoring me outside, all I have to do is shake the bag and they come running.
5481;Too confusing;"""A squeeze""? How do I know how much I should squeeze in order to get the proposed benefits on the bottle. I didn't like leaving that to chance."
5482;IT WORKS  FOR ME;I use it to help jump start my weight loss regime. I sometimes flip flop up and down 8 pounds when I am not careful and i drink this tea for about 3 days and I shed it all.
5483;Menthol mints;I have never heard of pine drops so I tried them.They do not taste like pine but more like a menthol cough drop.
5484;Quality Product, But Not What My Cat Would Prefer;"I purchaed the <a href=""http://www.amazon."
5485;Vino Italiano - A Quality Economy Wine Kit;This is my third Vino Italiano kit and I made a double batch of this Tuscany Rosso Magnifico to fill a 40 liter oak barrel I have ..
5486;still waiting....;i have not received my purchase..
5487;Good stuff;Baby loves this.  She is 14 months old and I scoop it into her bowl and she feeds herself.
5488;BEST CHOCOLATE EVER;This is one of the best chocolate i have eaten in a long time..
5489;Not good;I ordered the 10 oz crab cakes.  Usually you expect a shell or so, but not in EVERY bite.
5490;smiles;Smiles..
5491;Great Coffee (from a non-coffee drinker)!;I'll admit outright that I don't normally like coffee.  I'm a big drinker of hot tea though (and that's usually what I drink).
5492;This is the coffee I have been looking for;First had Lavazza at a local coffee shop and was floored. To me, this is what coffee should taste like.
5493;Yummy !;I love my Keurig machine and find the different flavored coffees to be such a nice indulgence.  I really enjoy this vanilla biscotti from Folgers.
5494;Kitty Litter Review;I use this product all the time.  I did not realize it was very small containers but that was my fault.
5495;Superb -- only the pecans are better;"This product, with spicy almonds / sesame seeds / dried apple chunks, is only slightly less delicious and interesting than the ""Valdosta"" pecan / cranberry snacks by Sahale.  These two snacks had none of the stale and rancid flavor of Sahale's ""Dauphine"" (walnut) and ""Soccorro"" (Macadamia/hazelnut) snacks that came in the same shipment."
5496;Coffee is good - Shipping is 3 months??;I really like Nantucket Blend.  I drink way too much!  So I thought I would buy the 96 ct.
5497;GREAT PRODUCT FOR GIVING MEDICINE 4CAPSULES & PILLS;My dog ha s Epilepsy and requires morning medication and evening medication.  4 are capsules.
5498;Tasty!;Bought this for my wife. We'd recently bought a Celestial Seasons variety pack and had been stunned by the over-a-dollar-a-cup price tag.
5499;Unenchanted;Product received quickly but unfortunate it gave my dog diarrhea after one lambs ear.  After waiting several days I tried again with same results.
5500;Best Olive Oil Ever;I have tried many olive oil's but most of the time I do not like them. None of the general store bought brands.
5501;lovin every drop;I have looked all over for a good decafinated cup of coffee.  I was about ready to give up when I discovered Senco decaffinated coffee pods.
5502;No Bam in this...;I have tried around 30 different coffees in the k-cup and i keep track on paper as to find some that I really do like.  I like dark coffee.
5503;Read the fine print!;Be careful when ordering this item, I expected for every type of tea pictured to come in the pack, however what comes is based on availability and there were two kinds replaced with more of others. I still received the correct number of teas, I just should have read the description more carefully.
5504;Perfectly portable snack;I have to stay for long hours at school, and I've been looking for snacks I can bring that aren't too unhealthy. When I found out about these fig newton minis, I was pretty excited since I absolutely love the full size fig newtons.
5505;awesome stuff!;love the product and have told all my friends.  Did notice since then, the price went up.
5506;Too Sweet;I've had other Kind bars and this one is okay (I don't particularly care for the taste). In my opinion, it's too sweet (while I occasionally indulge in sweet things, this isn't what I had expected with this product).
5507;Expected better quality;"We have two cats and we were feeding them with ""Advanced Pet Diets Select Choice"" food but unfortunately it was discontinued so we had to research for another great product. We were recommended this cat food by several people who know what the ingredients suppose to be in it and because this food is made by the same company so we expected same quality."
5508;Try a Box Before Buying a Case - a review of BTN's Mac & Cheese;I like organic. We do organic milk and meat (and vegetables when we can afford them).
5509;Haribo Gold Bears;Haribo Gold Bears<br /><br />Where to start?<br />Haribo Gold Bears are in the elite, top echelon of candies.<br />The perfect blend of flavors, texture, and satisfaction.
5510;Good but weak tea;Packaging suggests 1T for 10oz tea, which is high compared to most loose leaf teas, but the tea is still pretty weak at that concentration.  It definitely doesn't have enough flavor for iced tea, which is my preference.
5511;11 Flavors!!;So I wasn't convinced about the greatness of Popchips - until I tried them!!  Now, although they are more expensive than regular chips, they are so much healthier and taste GREAT so I'm not sure I will ever buy regular chips again!<br /><br />However, even though I loved the basic flavors in the 6-flavor variety I wanted to try some of the different varieties because they sounded good.  The only purchase option to try some of these other flavors was to buy a whole box, and I was very skeptical to buy an entire box of 24 if I didn't like the flavor.
5512;coconut oil;My 88 year old great-aunt swears by this stuff.  She says it cured her ulcers.
5513;fantastic;For a great appetizer, stuff these little guys with goat cheese (or goat cheese mixed with cream cheese) and a little fresh basil.  Just put the cheese and basil in a plastic baggie, sqish to mix (add mild if too thick), cut a corner from the bag, and squeeze into the drained Peppadews.
5514;not what I thought, but not bad;I purchased this product because I had the caribou coffee k-cup before & it was pretty good.  I wanted to sample what I thought were other flavours, and thought I was getting various samples because the picture had 3 different colours of lids on the product.
5515;This tea is tops.;This is one of my favorite teas.  The double dose of Bergamot gives this Earl Grey a wonderful flavor.
5516;Doctor Recommended;My doctor recommended this supplement.  It seems to really help me, so I hope it will also help you as well.
5517;good dunker;cookie part is nice and chocolaty but I could do without the swirled icing. It adds too much sweetness, and melts when dunked in my coffee.
5518;Taste good....a little sweet;I like this product. It is slightly sweet for my taste though.
5519;Mighty Leaf Iced Tea Sunburst Green;1 tea bag good for 32 oz pitcher. Great fruity clean taste.
5520;Just like I remembered eating as a kid.;The brand I remembered eating as a kid, allegedly changed their recipe. Surprisingly this product got it exactly right.
5521;Great Treats!;"First I want to say, I have a very ""picky"" little Peek-a-Poo. She absolutely loves these treats."
5522;Baby loved this on the first try!!!;We tried this for the first time while on vacation this month(risky, I know..
5523;My dog loves them!;My dog loves them a little too much..
5524;Delicious!;The popcorn pops up small, but tastes really good! Almost every kernel pops in my Whirly Pop, so there is very little waste. Another plus is that the hulls don't get stuck in your teeth.
5525;Moderately sweet biscuits are a filling, healthy snack;"The Newton Fig and Honey Fruit Thin may be hard for an American to peg.  Nabisco calls them ""crispy cookies"" but the English would likely label them as ""biscuits."
5526;THESE ARE SO GOOD!;I got these looking for good finger foods for my daughter. While the pieces are still a little big for her, she loves the flavors.
5527;Great item, bad packaging.;I have ordered this product, International Delight Hazelnut, two times. Both times it came with leaking singles that got all over the other ones.
5528;The Best;This is simply the best non-flavored coffee in K-cups that I have tried.  I drink my coffee black and this has an excellent coffee aroma and taste.
5529;happy mom;I have two, 10lb, russel terrier pups that absolutely love these bite size treats. Training them using these treats as positive rewards has simplified my life.
5530;Mr. Yoshida's sauce;I have been cooking with this sauce for many years! It is one of my favorite marinades. It has been hard to find it in stores and was delighted to find it on Amazon.
5531;Unpleasant Aftertaste Ruins Cereal;I will have to respectfully disagree with some of the other reviewers here.  As someone who cannot have gluten or casein, I often have difficulty finding good cereals.
5532;should say diet;It has artificial sweetener which not only taste bad to me but also gives me a headache. This should say light or diet to let the buyer know this.
5533;YUM!;This is a great product that feels like a healthy indulgence.  I hope the recipe isn't different than the one I tried from a convenience store, like a reviewer indicated previously.
5534;Good coffee with a small flavor boost;The Starbucks Natural Fusions Ground Coffee, Vanilla Flavored is a very smooth tasting coffee.  There is a very small hint of vanilla flavor that did NOT have a chemical taste.
5535;Stale;I bought these at Hannaford a year ago and they were not bad..
5536;best chocolate ever;I have had so many difference chocolates, high end to low end, and Gorant's Mill Creek Asst is one of the best I have ever had.  Creamy, different centers you don't find in other boxed chocolates.
5537;Love this item;"I really love these candies and have a couple every evening after dinner.  They satisfy my ""sweet"" cravings without the calories."
5538;Great bargain;I use to be able to buy this product and SAMS and save on the price but they no longer carry it. I was so glad to be able to at least order on line.
5539;Used it 15+- times;I had mine now a little over a year and use it on at least 15 occasions.  Parts are plastic and I would<br />also prefer them to be stainless steel, however the injector functions flawlessly.
5540;MTR offers Great Quality Tasting Food that wont break your wallet;Bisibelebath is a great lentil and vegetable broth that is thick, musky, with a hint of a little something spicy, but not too spicy or hott. This dish is amazing by itself, or i would recommend accompanying with Vegetable Pulao or you can make your own Rice.
5541;Good option;These are handy if you are trying to low-carb and miss your pasta fix. They aren't exactly like traditional pasta, naturally, but for us they do fill the void.
5542;Awesome brew, strong, bold!;Every time I get a new Keurig k-cup to try, it just gets better and better most of the time.  This one is no exception.
5543;Pretty tasteless;Quite tasteless and they make you order so many. I am stuck with 12 bags of this tasteless stuff.
5544;For when you forget the actual bacon;This is a great tasting product!! Both me and my wife love it. I don't know how they did it but it is wonderful.
5545;Tullys Coffee Kona Blend for Keurig K-Cup brewers;We like our coffee bold and this is perfect. A good wake-up in the morning and mellow enough to relax with while socializing or reading.
5546;Pure Awesomeness!!;The best salt of all sea salts!!!  There's nothing I can say that the other reviewers have already said.  This is truly the most delicious of salts.
5547;Different, Not Berry-Like, Not What You'd Expect;*****<br />St. Dalfour's Organic Strawberry Tea is a black tea with some very slight strawberry overtones---not enough to make it berry-like, but enough to make it different.
5548;Is it safe??;Is this food bought from the frito company? and is it expired? I just wanna know that my food isnt tampered with and would like to place an order..
5549;Junk;Low quality.<br />Self Hand packed.
5550;Great Popcorn;I have ordered this popcorn 3 times now.  It is just like being at the movies!  We don't get to go because we have small children so we make our home a theater.
5551;Pleasant;Like many on the Atkins diet, I needed something that I could put in my bag as a snack to keep me from buying any number of high carb snacks.  These cheese mini rounds are crunchy and tasty.
5552;Twang;Excellent product great for mexican beer and shooters of<br />tequila. Great on chicken and fish also.
5553;Neumans cat food;My cat has had a delicate stomach. I have tried many different foods and tricks.
5554;What's up?;Good flavor but they still have not solved their packaging problem.  I would say that 15 to 20% of the cups leak and leave a lot of grounds in the cup.
5555;My cats loved them!!!;Another review said their cats wouldn't touch these treats. I guess all cats are different because my cats go crazy for these treats.
5556;Great Office Snack;The staff in our organization loved this item.  It was placed in our kitchen as soon as it came in.
5557;Wakes you up, maybe a bit too much;I drink a strong black cup most mornings, thought I'd give Jet Fuel a try.  One thing is this is a strong cup of coffee.
5558;It's Just the Best;I need serious anise extract for my biscotti.  I have tried several other brands that are less expensive, but I always end up using 2-3 times the amount of the McCormick.
5559;Best coffee on the planet;I love coffee, until I had Eight O'clock Brand I never knew what excellent coffee was.  I only drink perked coffee, because it has the full flavor I'm looking for in a cup of coffee.
5560;use it all the time;I use this product a lot when I make Indian/desi food. I would give this product 5 stars.
5561;Another error, Wake up!;"Here's another 4.4lb bag of dog food that does not represent the normal ""regular"" price."
5562;A fast, sweet treat (with a tiny bit less guilt);I subscribed to these in the 6-count boxes (12 to a carton), rather than the 12-count boxes (6 to a carton, which cost $3 less at Amazon than the smaller boxes),  but whichever packaging you buy them in, I'd recommend these organic frosted strawberry toaster pastries . .
5563;No more non-GMO on label;Bought the nacho chips regularly for my kids but the last delivery came and there was not a non-GMO label on the package anymore, they still use organic corn but use non organic canola oil and any non organic canola is most likely Genetically Modified, which is something I do not want in my body.  Will not buy this product again.
5564;BEST stevia: best taste, no matodextrin, no aftertaste, not overly sweet;I suppose more people on Amazon haven't discovered this because it's not available (yet) with Prime shipment. It's worth paying shipping just to get it, so I order multiple boxes at a time to cut the cost (and Swanson is a good company that I order other things from, sometimes).
5565;Disappointing;Found this tea to be quite disappointing. Its flavor is quite weak, and doesn't remind me of a vanilla at all.
5566;Great bold flavor and great value;Love these k-cups, bold flavor similar to Jet Fuel or Big Easy with less of a French roast flavor.  I can actually get a 12 Oz.
5567;Looks Boring to Me, but the Dogs Love It;I hesitated a long time before buying our first Nylabone chew toy.  They are moderately expensive and, frankly, don't look all that exciting.
5568;Traditional Shortbread;I gave these packs out as Christmas goodies, but saved myself one.  Delicious!  The gifts were well received also.
5569;Senna Leaf tea;A friend suggested this as I have been taking pain medication which tends to bind the bowels. He told me that this would help keep me regular.
5570;Needs Help;When I opened the carton I found 4 packets consisting of:<br /><br />A. A clear packet containing what was described as pasta and had some similarity to orzo.
5571;Not very good expresso!;The marketing propaganda on this product is wrong.  It is not instant expresso by any count.
5572;BPA in Lid & Food;Like other customers, I was sorely disappointed to find out that there is indeed BPA-containing plastic in the lid of Earth's Best food products.  I feel that this company is taking advantage of customers and deceiving mothers & fathers who are trying to do the best by buying organic food for their babies.
5573;Worth the Price;Sure it costs a bit more, but all five (yes, cinco gatos!) of my cats love it.  Plus it's organic so you know you are feeding them the best and you know it's good for the earth.
5574;Great toy for a gentle chewer;The large Everlasting Treat Ball has been a great toy for our 55-lb Basset. It fits just about every type of treat, and you can choose different ways of stuffing it.
5575;Terrible;There are few foods I don't like, but I couldn't get these down. I can't begin to describe how terrible they taste and how unappetizing the texture is.
5576;Terrible;This tastes like scorched artificial butterscotch flavoring. If artificial sweeteners taste bitter to you, as they do to me, don't buy it.
5577;excellent dog food;After my dog has had wellness, she has more energy then before. I strongly recommend to people to buy it for your dog.
5578;Great coffee;I love Jamaica Me Crazy coffee. This version is flavorful, the price is pretty good, and it sure beats the office pot coffee that sits on a burner for hours.
5579;Not as great as it appears;"I was very excited to get this, but it was very disappointing. It had a plasticky off-gassing smell, and I noticed its made in China not ""french-made""."
5580;SUPER BUY!  HUGE BAG!;This is a great buy.  We are talking a whole pound, here.
5581;delicious!! 24 carbs for the whole bottle;$1.54 is average, works out to $18.
5582;strong/ not bitter;great cup of coffee. i MUST have these or else :) i am very fussy about my coffee.
5583;One packet might be better off making TWO cups;When I opened the pouch, I sniffed the contents and found the aroma to be intensely complex and inviting! I tried a little pinch of it raw -- and it excited my taste buds -- very enjoyable. I even think that the contents would be spectacular if sprinked over vanilla or dulce de leche ice cream -- this Gold Kili Ginger and Lemon Beverage Mix is VERY gingery and sweet --- and with a nice lemon tang.
5584;Vegetable Broth and Seasoning;My daughter led me to this fine broth and seasoning. This is the best product of its kind on the market.
5585;Great Flavor with a BAM!;This is one of our favs. Gets you started in the morning.
5586;Low Carb cereal that works for me;Item arrived well packed in plastic.<br />Great price with subscribe and save and expiry date 9 months later.
5587;Best Pods;Better than Puck's.  Better than Senseo.
5588;Better than shopping in stores;I can now make all the Tiramisu I want plus all the low carb variations that are out there.  Specialty items like this are hard to find in country stores where I live so I keep them in the freezer and escape to Italy anytime I want.
5589;"Once you go ""Double Black"" you'll never go back!";Not for the amateur coffee drinker! If your current coffee just isn't doing the job, step up to the Double Black Diamond. We like dark, bold coffees and this one is our number one fave.
5590;Over roasted;These do seem to be a little more roasted than other JBM beans I've bought on Amazon. This one didn't smell as good when I opened the bag, it smelled more burnt.
5591;Love it;Love this dipping mustard.  Bought a jar from a vendor at December Nights in San Diego about 3 years ago.
5592;German Chocolate. Yum!!;LOVE this product. The best one is the Peppermint & the Marzipan by far.
5593;Great stuff!;Love this Chai tea. It is the best.
5594;Great tea~!;I first tried this as a friend from CA (originally from England) had me try it.  I have never been a coffee or tea drinker, but loved this tea!  It has a mild, yet distinctive flavor.
5595;Sometimes works sometimes doesn't and it's overpriced;I remember when this product came to the market, it was dirt cheap at your local gas station. Now that the product has taken off the price has also taken off, it is easily twice as much as it used to be.
5596;Good Pizza Crust;This pizza crust is easy to make and has a good taste.  If you prefer a softer type crust, you do not need to bake the crust before adding sauce and toppings.
5597;no place like homestyle;I was wondering what happen to homestyle popcorn. it had been my favorite for a long time and then suddenly disappeared from all stores i have shopped in.
5598;this is the only coffee i drink;original kahlua coffee is a very good coffee. every time i go out and buy a cup of coffee it always taste burnt.
5599;Excellent Proudct and Fast Service;I ordered this product from Amazon with hesitancy, which I normally buy from Indian grocery stores.  When I placed the order the shipping date showed as 30 to 45 days, but it arrived in 7 days.
5600;Yummy, but you might find a better price...;Definitely a 5 star product, but we get it at Costco in a 30-pack for about $10. If you have Costco in your area, you might want to check it out.
5601;The puppies love it;Our one dog constantly had dried out skin, and has always been such a picky eater, she'll starve before she eats something she doesn't like.  Our puppy also had stool that smelled just awful, and I get that poop always smells, but I've had dogs my entire life, and nothing compared.
5602;a little bit of Christmas;I purchase these mints every year for my son.  He says it isn't Christmas with the mints he remembers as a child.
5603;"Led to the best ""gasms"" of my life!!!";"I am a 36 year old female and have tried plenty of products to enhance my bedroom fun and help me achieve the big ""O"". Nothing works like NeuroPassion."
5604;Sour Hormel product;I opened one of these dishes for roast beef, mashed potatoes and gravy and found it to be SOUR.  I want credit for the 6 unit carton.
5605;Dan's Perfect Popcorn;Dan's Perfect Popcorn<br /><br />Note:  This is a very thorough recipe, but it is very important you follow these steps closely.<br /><br />Heat 2 TBS of vegetable oil in a medium sized pot for 5 minutes on high.
5606;Not for me;I didn't purchase this product for myself, but it was important enough that I wanted to review anyway.<br />A family member of mine is undergoing weekly chemotherapy.
5607;Versatile & Delicious;Whether sprinkled on veggies, cereal or mixed into smoothies, this hemp seed is the best. My young daughters even enjoy eating it plain with a spoon.
5608;great pancakes;very good. everyone liked these.
5609;Newman's Own;My cat eats well and has good digestion.  Last spirng I switched her from Science Diet to Orijen, which had been recommended to me by the owner of one of those fancy pet stores in downtown LA.
5610;Ripped pods;The delivery was prompt, but the pods came in horrible shape. They look alright from the outside, but once you open them, you'll find that a huge percentage of the pods are just ripped, and thus deemed useless unless you have the patience to actually collect the coffee and then do the tampering manually.
5611;Smooth and Sublime--This is Kona for the Hawaiian Demigods;The aroma from a pot of this coffee is earthy and heavenly at the same time. Everything about this product--packaging, texture, and taste--tells you that it was lovlngly produced under rigid standards.
5612;snack;Great snack and easy to make - just pop in microwave.  Good for the whole family and easy to share with everyone.
5613;the real stuff;Other than the green ones tasting oddly like Pine-Sol, this is the best of the Salt-Water taffy currently found on Amazon.<br />Fralinger's sets the standard.
5614;Loaded with flavor;If you enjoy cinnamon this is an excellent coffee. It is smooth but leans toward a bold roast packed with a cinnamon kick.
5615;HORRIBLE I CANT BELIEVE THIS!;Terrible! I cannot believe this, I received this item and EVERY SINGLE BAG WAS OPENED BUT 4!!!! I'm stationed in Afghanistan and this was gonna be a snack for my team while going out on missions. I was so embarrassed when the bags were opened and spilt out all in the box, gross! And the box is filled with grease stains.
5616;One my favorite breakfasts;This is a good alternative to oatmeal.  It takes a little while longer to make in the microwave than oatmeal, but it can be done at a lower power setting.
5617;Not bad but a little hard to get used to;My husband likes these a lot. They are a bit different to get used to as they are less greasy and salty in taste than the usual chips you buy.
5618;Cracker Crumbs;Taste is great -- but by the time I got the package open it was largely in crumbs.  The packaging is too tough -- unless you have a scissors or knife handy.
5619;Quaker made this??;I received a sample courtesy Influenster, well..
5620;Good flavor;I really like this cornbread and muffin mix fro Pamela's products. The consistency is really good and the flavor is great too.
5621;Really Cool Game!;This was purchased as a game for my thirteen-year-old daughter's Harry Potter themed get-together to celebrate the release of the final movie.  The jelly bean game is loads of hysterical fun, and fit very well with our theme.
5622;Addictive!;"Wasn't sure how these would taste - after an initial ""hmm, interesting"" my mouth said ""yummy"".  The rest is history."
5623;Very Good Product;This is by far the best crystallized ginger I've ever had. So many brands are a lot of sugar and not a lot of ginger, this ginger is the complete opposite.
5624;Very tasty;This is a great product that is very easy to make. It never clumps, which is a great plus when it comes to dry sauce mixes.
5625;love these!!!;these are awesome!! they are probably my favorite brand of bars. i like how they don't contain a lot of ingredients(i think usually about 2-5) & it's all very natural stuff (probably the most natural bars out there), like dates, nuts, and stuff like that.
5626;Delivers what was promises;Wolfgang Puck's Chef's Reserve Colombian (Dark Roast) is basically what they said it will be. Dark roast, but not too strong.
5627;Bitter!;I had high hopes for this coffee based on the reviews but was let down.  I picked up a can of this to have on hand incase I ran out of fresh beans for my grinder and I'm glad that I didn't get the 4 pack!  Perhaps I got a bad batch since the reviews here are mostly positive but I found this to be incredibly bitter when making espresso in my Rancilio Silvia.
5628;NO FLAVOR  Spent over $100.00 on 6 jars;I purchased 6 jars of this Almond Butter on a suggestion from someone who had eaten it before.  I am so disappointed, After spending well over $100.
5629;great alternative for coffee drinkers;This coffee is a great alternative for someone who has acid reflux and ulcer problems.  The low acid allows me to still have my caffine for the day.
5630;Second batch inferior to first;My son drinks gallons of green tea.  We ordered one of the three-packs in the fall, and it was really good.
5631;Decent cat litter;I used to buy World's Best Cat litter when my cats were kittens then I switched to Fresh Step after they turned 1 year old. The world's best litter is pricy and does not absorb odor well.
5632;Not Pure Juice;When looking for pink grapefruit juice, I wanted 100% juice with no added sweetners.  This product seemed to fit the bill, since it is listed as Florida's Natural Ruby Red Grapefruit Juice.
5633;good stuff;This agave nectar is smooth, good flavor with no bittersweet taste. Taste great and delicious in cereal, fruit smoothies, and over french vanilla ice cream.
5634;My dog LOVES these;"Usually my dog is particular about his treats. When he got a whiff of these ""treat time"" was over quickly."
5635;Best Easter gift;This Easter I found a great gift item for my neighbor who is the mother of a six year old. I wanted something that would delight both mother and daughter and came across the Somebunny special Easter bunny rabbit gift tower.
5636;Just like the old Eagle Mills San Francisco Sourdough Bread Machine Mix;While I lamented the lack of Eagle Mills San Francisco Sourdough Bread Machine Mixes on Amazon, someone had commented that the company had been acquired by Krusteaz and that I should try that mix instead.  Being unable to find it anywhere in my local stores and feeling like I had to have an alternative to homemade sourdough, I finally relented and ordered the boxes.
5637;BOO HISS KRAFT FOODS;I along with the rest of you grapefruit fans am mad that Kraft thinks that this flavor isn't that popular. Whenever I went into a Walmart,(less than $3 price too) I would buy up all that they had, because it was ALWAYS SOLD OUT!!!!!! I urge you to email Kraft.
5638;Too many tradeoffs;Perhaps the best thing that I can say about the Pure Natural Bars is that they are okay, not great and certainly NOT a substitute for a brownie or treat.  It might be a healthier alternative, but you're going to sacrifice taste (the first tradeoff).
5639;Pamela's bread mix is great;The best bread mix I have used that is gluten free.  With a minimum of effort and my bread machine I can have bread made in a little over 2 hours.
5640;Aces!!!!;This stuff is 'finestkind'! The slightly tart flavors of tangerine and mango were positively inescapable, whilst the carbonation was quite crisp. The added Splenda provided just the right touch of sweetness, without crossing the line.
5641;Quick filling lunch;I love to bring these to work because they don't need a fridge or freezer and they heat up quickly (1 minute!). They are easy to put together, and you can add in veggies easily to make it more filling.
5642;shrunk to a 42 pack;This 50 pack was only a 42 pack in my order. When I noticed pack was only half full upon opening, I counted and box WAS short.
5643;they really are that bad.;They have a rubbery texture and taste bad. I don't know what they did, but it was a big mistake.
5644;Great!!!;Fantastic cocoa.  All the flavors are excellent but my personal favorite is the dark chocolate.
5645;Too much filler material, but chocolate chip the best flavor;I'm not a big fan of the new type of Quaker Oats granola bar
5646;Great Coffee!!;This is my everday coffee and I love it. Add a little non-fat creamer and a splenda.
5647;Gooseberries delight;My order of a case of gooseberries arrived in a short time. I made one pie according to the directions on the inside of the label.
5648;SWF seeks tall, dark, warm, fast Joe.;So I had this enormous coffeemaker and I like to have a cup of coffee before I buzz off to work.  Problem: Mr.
5649;Decadent Coffee!;Having never sampled this flavor, I took a chance and ordered a 2 pack because it sounded so delicious.  I'm happy to say I made the right choice.
5650;Whats happened in Oct 2011  not 2009;Three years ago we found out our dog Bella had severe food allergies.Fish,potatos,veggies,fruit and a few other selected foods are all she can eat.
5651;Not as described and more regular coffee and teas added;I am extremely disappointed in this offer. The advertisement states several different types of flavor coffees which is what you do not receive.
5652;GREAT CATFOOD;"Because of our cat's digestive problems, and due to multiple unsuccessful trials of other ""top"" brands of canned cat food, led us to try the WELLNESS brands. Our feline-centric veterinarian concurred, and I am happy to report that after 2 weeks, our cat is responding wonderfully!<br /><br />He is a ""new"" cat! He LOVES THIS FOOD! A great, all-natural product."
5653;Puppy Is Crazy for Them;I just started training my Maltese puppy to be obedient. He is catching on with these treats because he will do ANYTHING to sink his tiny little teeth into these.
5654;old friend;Used to get Skinners when I was a kid in Kansas. Hard to come by on the West coast.
5655;Perfect;Honestly, I can't understand the complaints that people have about this product. Food pops out easily (I never have to run it under hot water) and it doesn't make your hands cold.
5656;Nasty Stuff;This stuff is pretty nasty. I live in a household with two cats.
5657;Good, but not great;When I first started to buy VitaGravy, my dogs loved it. After a few weeks, they don't seem to care too much for it anymore.
5658;Good for a Teething Baby.;Our 11-month-old boy is teething and starting on solid foods. We've been giving him more and more solids for a number of months now.
5659;One of my favorite bold coffees!;If you enjoy other Starbucks bold coffees, this one will not disappoint.  It has the classic earthy fullness characteristic of a good African grown coffee.
5660;Move over Almond Joy and Snickers!;Unbeatable! I've been cruising the protein bar isle for years, and this product just took first place in my book! I relapsed on carbs when I had Odwalla's Peanut Crunch Bar (though yummy very high in carbs). Who needs to cheat when there are Kind Bars on hand.
5661;nanas;i have tryed the oatmeal, chocolate chip, coconut chip and love them all. A wonderful no sugar cookie.
5662;Best snack ever!;I got these at my local Publix. They're the best tasting almonds of the bunch.
5663;awesome coffee;I have enjoyed this brand of coffee for several years now and it has been consistent in flavor!  I was happy to see that it came in a 50-count box..
5664;Does anyone else on Amazon know what green tea is supposed to taste like?;Im not sure what everyone else on here thinks green tea is supposed to taste like, but this is not it. I go through about half a gallon of green tea a day, so Im always willing to try new flavors, brands, etc.
5665;Blah;Good aroma, good mouth feel, but the taste..
5666;A Surprising Blend of Bean and Apple;"I wasn't sure what to expect from this Jelly Belly flavor. I have eaten ""red apples"" before but they were usually in a fruit."
5667;Best Mayo Ever!;i was introduced to Duke's Mayo in North Carolina and haven't had a reliable source until Amazon. It reminds me of the home-made mayo my mom used to make.
5668;excellent oil;This is an excellent oil. We first got hooked on it while living in SLC 6 years ago.
5669;Not a good dog food;This is bottom of the barrel dog food. You can tell by the ingredient list.
5670;Looks & smells good enought to eat!;"This is a perfect example of ""you get what you pay for"".  Yes this is expensive but by golly, I think it's real food!  Amazing!  Upon opening the little can, I see flakes of fish & some liquid."
5671;Awesome K-Cup Apple Cider;This is the best K-cup apple cider I have tasted.  It also has ZERO calories, a major plus for people on a diet or with Diabetes.
5672;Its OK;Its OK. It tasted more like sugar than pina colada :( i was a lit bit dissapointed.
5673;My dog LOVES these;My dogs have severe allergies and can only consume duck, salmon, white fish and potatoes. Needless to say, finding treats they can eat is challenging.
5674;Terrible - Tastes nothing like store bought product;"I had been purchasing this product for several months at our local grocery store.  The product became unavailable and I couldn""t find it anywhere."
5675;So disappointed.. where is the meat?;I got this product about a month ago to try it for the first time.  My cat and I were pleased so I got 24 more.
5676;Probably fine, but doesn't live up to the hype;I read the marketing hype on the Tropical Traditions website and ordered this product through Amazon.  I'm quite disappointed - the taste is not great.
5677;Great Taste That Won't Keep Me Up!;I'm a big fan of the Lipton To Go products, I drink a lot of their White Tea W/ Raspberry because it's wonderful but Caffeine limits my drinking to the mornings and early afternoons, Then I found out about the Tea & Honey Strawberry Acai and I had to try it!<br /><br />It's a true taste treat and the sugars are very low (1g per serving) So I don't have to worry because of my dietary limitations of sugar.<br /><br />I have a iSi soda siphon, that I've been using for years and after putting a  packet of this Iced Tea mix in the bottom of my glass, I spray some of my carbonated seltzer water into the glass making the most delicious Green Tea soda I have ever tasted, I LOVE IT!<br /><br />This mix is truly delicious and it's decaf, I will be enjoying this as I watch my evening TV without losing sleep.
5678;Great mojito flavor and if you are clever, you can make cocktails out of this too;I haven't had Crystal Light for a long time.  Not since my childhood, when my mom used to drink it.
5679;Green Mountain Coffee Nantucket Blend K-Cups;I have tried a variety of K-Cups for my Keurig Brewer and find Green Mountain Coffee Nantucket Blend works best for me in taste.  I shop Amazon when offers are available including free shipping.
5680;Love these!!!;Mariani Cherries are by far the best dried Cherry available. Always so fresh, not to tart.
5681;Very good bouillon but hard to find in stores now;I think these vegetable bouillon cubes are great.  Each individually-wrapped cube makes two cups of vegetable broth.
5682;Poor Packaging--Lost Product;I ordered the Fifty50 Crunchy Peanut butter and it arrived promptly--BUT, one jar of the product was completely busted open and coated the other jars, and one jar was crushed but no product was lost.  I left comments on packaging with Amazon, but am unable to get a refund for the broken jar for this product.
5683;Just Water Baby;Not exactly sure what to say about Essentia 9.5 pH Drinking Water, 1.
5684;Perfet bite sized treats!;These treats are wonderful. They are healthy and you can tell they are full of EFA's.
5685;Our favorite chips;These chips are the whole family's favorite. They are just the right size to share, but not so big that they go stale before they are gone.
5686;Is Crystal Light for adults or children;I drink Crystal Light as an alternative to soft drinks and a low calorie treat.  The taste is always great but I wish they offered a formula that did not contain chemicals just for presentation.
5687;OK;It is OK.  No need to spend money on expensive mints!  It is better to brush one's teeth or chew a Big Red Cinnamon gum.
5688;best cat food in the world!!!!;My cat was very sick with kidney problems and she had little chance of making it.I tried every kidney food out there and remembered my daughter had a sick cat that liked wellness.
5689;Got um !!;These thing are great.  They all but eliminated the gnat problem that developed on my orchids.
5690;TASTE LIKE GARDEN GROWN...FRESH!!!;My husband and I LOVE these San Marzano tomatoes.  NO, they are not from Italy.
5691;Delicious;These are simply delicious, and so good for you! I would highly recommend them as the perfect snack. Great with soups, sandwiches or the base for your home made trail mix.
5692;MY REVIEW OF NATURE'S PATH HERITAGE FLAKES;GOOD BASE TO BUILD ON. ALL IT NEEDS IS A LITTLE HONEY AND IT'S GREAT.
5693;It is made with a healthy sweetener (xylitol) rather than the bad stuff.;Healthy preserves without sugar and harmful artificial sweeteners. It's made with xylitol, which is actually good for you.
5694;Cheaper at stores;You can get it cheaper at stores, around $3.00 each.
5695;My son's favorite flavor!;It seems every baby company has these pouches these days but no one has them that include SALBA, which is a super-grain that is so nutritious and good for brain development.  I know I'm not alone in having a picky toddler (2 1/2) and struggles to get fruits and esp.
5696;Awesome coffee;This is one of the best k-cups ever.  Yah, it smells funny while is brewing but the taste is awesome.
5697;Great flavor, intense heat;Pure Habanero added amazing flavor and great heat to a recent batch of chili I made. It seemed to add a depth to the flavors that were already present as well as its own amazing flavor.
5698;Truffles with breakfast.;Start your day off right.  Cook some steel cut oats and amaranth (2:1) in unsweetened almond-flavored soy milk.
5699;Yummy and addictive;Expensive little buggers - sixty cents for a piece of candy is pretty steep.  But they're almost worth it.
5700;Not recommended;I bought this tea because I love the Thai Ice tea I get at my local Thai restaurant.  Although it taste similar to the tea I love, no matter how many different ways I make it, I still get a nasty after-taste.
5701;Excellent product;This drink is great hot or cold over ice.  It has a great flavor.
5702;Best K-cup yet... but pricey;4 stars for the flavor, aroma and strength. Missing a star for exorbitant price per K-cup.
5703;If you're looking to add a truffle LOOK only to your dish & NO Flavor--then this is it!;Little lesson on TRUFFLES..
5704;Great Blend of Medicinal Teas;I really like this tea.  I've been trying st.
5705;Delicious;I love these whole wheat crackers by Lance!  It's a nice big pack so I  have plenty.  I get cravings for these and they're great for a snack which I enjoy a pack for every day.
5706;Intended for pod brewer;
5707;Great Gum!;I ordered this gum in hopes of finding a healthier gum that tasted good and I was not disappointed. Around the same time I ordered some Peelu gum and was extremely disappointed in that.
5708;Great Puppy Food;I would recommend this puppy food!  We have a puppy that got off to a sad start.  We found him along an interstate with a broken shoulder and was malnourished.
5709;Best Bar there is;Ive tried every bar, these are BEST. Just the right amount of protein, fat, carbs, sugar, everything.
5710;Excellent espresso!;I am a big fan of Lavazza coffee products and I usually buy the crema e gusto.  This time, I decided to try the Lavazza in Blu.
5711;The best!;We love this curry paste.  Absolutely delicious - can use more or less to make dishes slightly or very spicy.
5712;Yummy taste!;Having recently quit caffeine, and being a bit bored with herbal teas, I decided to try Teecino and ordered their sampler. The first flavor I tried, Chai, was not my type of thing, but *this*! The chocolate mint flavor is almost like a dessert, a cross between coffee and hot chocolate with distinct (but not bothersome) mint flavor.
5713;MY PUPPY LOVES THEM;MY 3 MONTH OLD MIX LAB/RETRIEVER (CHESTER MATEO) HAS TRIED beef & turkey AND lamb & salmon AND I JUST BOUGHT chicken & lamb. HE JUST LOVED THE 2 PREVIOUS ONES.
5714;the best dry cat food hands down;I was glad to find this high-protein low-carb dry cat food here on Amazon.  It is conspicuously absent from the shelves of many big box pet food stores.
5715;Decent Instant Coffee;I love coffee - good coffee - so am hesitant to even review an instant coffee.  However, there are times when I'm not up for brewing (especially not decaf) and this brand of instant works well.
5716;hmm ok;I think I taste more of the mango then the peach but over all I like the Vita Coco water with flavors then just by itself. I am not in the food science world but I think Coconut water is made by taking the coconut milk and separating the cream/ solids from the water part.
5717;Great Chocolate Chip Cookies!!!;These cookies are great for people who can't have wheat or sugar.  They taste like real chocolate chip cookies!!  I have been looking for a substitute and these are the ones.
5718;pretty good;this is the only grits my husband will eat now. since i started changing the way we eat, taking out all whites, this was the way to go quality wise.
5719;Not Good;These bars just do not taste good. They have a sourish taste and also a long lasting bitter aftertaste.
5720;Certified organic liver for my dog! I'm very glad this product is on the market.;UPDATE:<br />The company determined that the product I received was defective in some way. They speculated it got too hot during storage or shipping.
5721;Really Delicious Carob Powder;I've used a couple brands of Carob powder from raw to roasted.  Using this in my coffee or with soy milk heated and stevia for sweetener makes truly wonderful mock hot chocolate drink.
5722;My daughter loves them;My 21 month old is a picky eater when it comes to breakfast food.  She hates eggs, and our attempts to feed her Quaker oatmeal was not successful.
5723;Thick and just the right amount of sweetness and maple;I started subscribing to this syrup this summer as a replacement for my usual Nature's Promise syrup.  I'll admit it took me a little while to get used to because the taste and consistency are very different form the Nature's Promise (NP).
5724;Change The Picture!!!!!;I ordered this item because the picture shows that it is a Blue Sky Sugar Free Soda. The product is actually Hansen's Cherry Vanilla Cream Soda sweetened with cane sugar.
5725;expresso without having to make it;Makes a great Latte without the trouble of brewing expresso. great tasting not bitter.
5726;One of the Best and Delicious;I remembered this cereal from my childhood and had to buy it.  It is still delicious.
5727;hmm... dogs enjoy, but there are healthier liver treat options;"My dogs love these treats, and I do buy them occasionally because they are cheap and perched at the check-out counter of our local garden/feed store. But check out the ingredient list-- I don't think anyone can feel good about feeding their dog high-fructose corn syrup! Just not the healthiest option-- when so many of our dogs are overweight, it seems better to feed them a real liver treat, versus this product which is ""made with liver""."
5728;Long Time Loyal Customer NO Longer!;I have ONLY fed my 3 dogs Canidae since 2002. Until 3 days ago we have HAD no problems at all, and I had highly recommended the food to everyone who would listen.
5729;Really good;Delicious syrup!  4 out of 5 only because I didn't feel like the flovor was as buttery as I expect from a toffee flavor.  This is very similar to the caramel flavor (which is also delicious!)  Amoretti is my new favorite brand of syrups.
5730;great;it is a really great product. it helps me stick to my diet.
5731;love it;This tastes just like the iced tea you buy at Starbucks. I like it better because I make it with purified, filtered water.
5732;The Best;I have tried all the K-Cup coffee's and I always come back to this one, it sounds like a foo-foo drink but the aroma and taste make it a good cup of coffee anytime of day, and the price is right too.  I buy two fifty packs and that comes out to just a little over four cents for a twelve ounce cup of coffee.
5733;'One Love' Marley Coffee;I love the smooth flavor of these single serve pods, but also believe in their mantras of organic, 'fair trade' coffee. I'm much more likely to purchase organic coffee in the first place.
5734;New favorite syrup;"My husband and I have tried myriad brands of pure maple syrup over the past two years, but Anderson's is now our favorite! The taste is exceptional: mild but rich, ""mapley"" but not sickeningly sweet. After my first order, I tried going back to another organic brand we've frequently used, but the difference in taste was too noticeable."
5735;Could be better.;I expected this cereal to be sickeningly sweet, and for the middle to be rather gooey and overpowering.  Fortunately, the cereal is none of those things, thank goodness.
5736;Highly recommended!;Amazing coffee!  It gives you exactly what you need to get you moving in the morning..
5737;the perfectoil that doesn't break the bank;buttery smooth with delicate overtone of flavor- my new favorite olive oil. great for dipping , cooking or anything else.
5738;Eat. Think. New name please...;Title says it all!  They need to come up with a better name.  Now onto the good things.
5739;Southern Pecan;One of the best K Cups that I have tried. It was not overwhelming and you could just taste a hint of pecan without it tasting artificial.
5740;Food-Great;I have McCann's Oatmeal every morning and by ordering it from Amazon I am able to save almost $3.00 per box.
5741;SeattleLee;Loved the distinct flavor of Stash Organic Chai Black and Green Tea and, when I could not find it, finally purchased the Earl Grey Black and Green.  Found it okay, but nothing unusual or extremely tasty.
5742;smells great, tastes bland;The steeping instructions say to leave tea bag in the mug for 5 minutes for best flavor - I say it's more like 20 mins. It smells really great, but there just isn't that much flavor.
5743;Organic coffee pods;I know organic has a different taste, but this is bad. Couldn't get even one cup down.
5744;THIS IS AMAZING. but a little pricey;I am on a diet, and this peanut butter is really really really really healthy. Will buy again in bulk.
5745;Best cheese ever;It's good.  Seriously good.
5746;Delicious...gluten-free...easy...versatile & travels well.;This products is delicious for a packaged pesto. It's gluten-free, quick to make, versatile ( you can make it low fat too)& it's easy to travel with.
5747;Great cooking and much more;We use this for all of our cooking. It is great for frying any thing.
5748;Great snack!!;For a healthy and guilt free snack, try these nuts.  The combinations of ingredients are interesting, the flavor is complex, they have a nice crunch.
5749;Best Decaf I've had..;Its so hard to find a good decaf. Either their is a nasty burnt, stale taste or it just taste old.
5750;Babies LOVE puffs!;What is it about these puffs that babies love so much?  Both my kids could not get enough.  Currently, my 9 month old just loves them.
5751;Fantastic chips!!!;I want to start out by saying that i thought at first that a bag with only 120 calories and 4 grams of fat (no saturated or trans) for every 20 chips was going to taste like crap. I must say that not only was i wrong, that this is my favorite BBQ chip on the market today.
5752;way too sweet;44 grams of sugar and 170 calories in 12 ounces. Hansens wake up, people dont want death by sugar and a zillion calories in 12 ounces of ginger ale, try adding more real ginger and cut back on  cane sugar.
5753;"Should be called ""Peanut bar with Almonds and Other Nuts""";"While this bar (Almond Walnut Macadamia with Peanuts) is really tasty, I was surprised by the misleading description because Peanuts are actually the first ingredient (you have to lift the marketing flap on the packaging to discern the actual ingredients), yet they say ""Almond Walnut Macadamia + Protein with Peanuts"". Their description would tend to let you think peanuts are way down on the list."
5754;Great Tasting Chips;After looking at the pictures someone put on here showing a crushed box, I had to write a review.  I have bought these chips numerous times from Amazon Warehouse Deals and each time they came packaged perfectly.
5755;Strong cherry taste, more tart than sweet;These bars have a strong cherry taste, but because they have no sugar, they don't really taste like cherry pie. The bars have only three ingredients: dates, almonds, and unsweetened cherries.
5756;Love it;Can't get this here in this little MX town.  It's my breakfast every AM and I will continue to orer it when I run out.
5757;Great For Dipping!;My mother-in-law introduced me to this sauce years ago and I have loved it ever since. Me and my kids cant live without it! Try it with a little rice vinegar added and it is a great dipping sauce for egg rolls, california rolls and gyozas.
5758;Just don't.;I actually bought these at Tarjay, but these are basically the same thing.  Evenflo Comfi Angled-Neck bottles.
5759;Way over priced.;This vendor is clearly attempting to take advantage of consumers.  A 4 pack used to be sold for about $20 and has since doubled in price.
5760;Simply the best!;Forget everything else and just use this simple product to kill your moles. Getting rid of their food source or trying to chase them away through other ways just will NOT work.
5761;Amazing taste;I love these. That is the easiest way to put it.
5762;Not the best nutrition, but the dogs love it;The first thing I have to say is my dogs love this.  It's what my dad feeds his dogs, and my dogs always raid their food dishes when I take them to his house.
5763;Quick and yummy, but very salty;"This evening we had <a href=""http://www.amazon."
5764;Love this coffee;I just en joy pouring it into the grinder and smelling the aroma.  It makes a very good cup of coffee.
5765;yummy;really does taste like the name.  Not overpowering chocolate either.
5766;Spicy Sweet;I purchased this one twice. I like that it is spicy and sweet.
5767;My favourite coffee;I received exactly what I intended to order. It came securely packedged  and arrived sooner than I had expected.
5768;Yummy!!;These are my new favorite. I have always liked Kashi's Crunchy granola bars but had never been a fan of their chewy varieties until now.
5769;Alfalfa Sprouts;Thanx Amazon..
5770;Great value;I purchase this for an MD practice and the auto ship is so convenient. This way we never run out of Splenda and the price is half as much as we were paying another vendor.
5771;dogs LOVE it--  best treat for rewards and training;Freeze dried liver has a hypnotic effect on dogs. They LOVE it and will do just about anything for it, so it is a great treat to use for training.
5772;Delicious and diet friendly. Thanks Amazon;I found one lone bag of these in a TJ Maxx. They were terrific and I went back for more.
5773;Anti-oxidants...;Organic oregano gives me omega-3, 8% vitamin K and many anti-oxidants and disease preventing properties. It has a strong taste that does not compliment my dinners, so I consume just small amount of it every night to get the benefits without ruining the taste of my dishes.
5774;Great Buy;I love Lord of the Rings and I love Pez so this was something I obviously needed. The package got here on time and was in perfect condition when recieved.
5775;I love them:);I have always liked these but I haven't had them in years.  Today, I was hungry and saw them at the natural market checkout counter.
5776;DO NOT buy this from AMAZON!;Good cereal - my favorite in fact, however the packages I got from Amazon are not crunchy and stale.  I cannot even return or exchange any of them either.
5777;Sprouted well!;I was very impressed with the freshness of these beans.  They sprouted within 24 hours.
5778;Good for baking sweet things--too sweet and lumpy for anything else.;I've used this with great success in making gluten-free impossible sweet potato pies.  (E-mail me if you want the recipe--it's going in the cookbook.
5779;Stash Darjeeling Tea;I was disappointed with this tea.  The taste was no better than Liptons Yellow Label Tea.
5780;Great way to buy pumpkin offseason;We buy this pumpkin as a supplement for our dogs. It is very hard to find pumpkin offseason, especially in a small town.
5781;burnt;These bags had a lot of overcooked brown pieces. also felt very greasy.
5782;Total misrepresentation;I purchased a bag of Nutro Ultra Small bree dog food for 34.00.
5783;My fancy feast only cat loves it at first but now he only likes the juice in it!;My 5yr old cat eats only Fancy Feast Grilled products. He does not enjoy Science diet or Halo canned food much after he got a taste of Fancy Feast Grilled.
5784;nice gift;It was my cousin's birthday and she's fond of chocolates. So, this was a very nice gift for her.
5785;Good stuff;Great little cups.  I previously had the international delight brand vanilla creamers and they always seemed a bit off.
5786;Bad Item;I ordered this item as a gift for my daughter who had received a Keurig brewer for Christmas. The cups arrived partially opened and with holes in them.
5787;Wellness CORE Ocean Recipe;I got this at a great price and fast free shipping. My miniature schnauzer is liking it ok so far, not as  well as she liked the other flavors of Wellness CORE.
5788;Delicous and Fresh;We had been getting this granola at the health food store and found it online at Amazon.  It is much cheaper and more fresh than the health food store and delivered to my front door.
5789;Xylitol;Amazon made it so easy to compare prices and order the Xylitol.  Quick ship as well.
5790;picaridin rocks;OK, so picaridin is not as effective as DEET and doesn't last as long. Now that we agree on that, lets look at why I rarely use DEET anymore.
5791;C.E.T. Enzymatic Oral Hygiene Chews;I have been purchasing this product for many years because it does help little dog's teeth.  I am familiar with it
5792;Wow!!;I hd ordered the men's dandruff shampoo in this same brand.  It worked super well so I decided to try this one for my thin ageing hair.
5793;Perfect size;The bags are a perfice size for small children as well as adults.  Your hand fits in perfectly and holds enough popcorn.
5794;Decent Fast Meal;Product was fresh, price reasonable, packaging was good, shipping was fast. It has kind of a tangy flavor that I haven't decided I really like or not.
5795;These are fine;"I've gone through a whole package of these in just over a year and came back to see about ordering some more. I didn't notice any problem, unlike the other reviewer who complains of a smell of ""ammonium."
5796;LOVED!;We purchased two of the rawhide dog bones for our two dogs - we have a pitbull mix and a boxer, both who go through rawhides like they are going out of style. We had spent 30$ at Petsmart for a similar product, but they didnt enjoy the Petsmart ones as much as these ones.
5797;Love it!!;I quit using lotion on my face and switched to this. I now rarely ever break out.
5798;Addictive!;I recently picked up a single tub of this at my local Wally World because they didn't have the butter flavor I was looking for. Took this home, popped it up and my wife and I loved it! We didn't even really care for kettle corn but this one is different.
5799;Tangy goodness.;These are so tangy it prevents me from eating too many, a handful or two does the trick. Very crisp and savory.
5800;kitty goes bananas for this wild salmon;My very picky 11 year old Himalayan just loves this salmon, and occasionally the chunked chicken -- I mash them both in her food bowl.  I'm happy that it's wild caught and looks like it's made from acceptable parts of the fish.
5801;More decorative than tasty;I really like tea and this is so inventive.  I love the look of the flowers when they bloom.
5802;worst tea in the world;How this tea could get any stars is beyond me.  I tried one bag and could not taste anything.
5803;Why do they use High Fructose Corn Syrup?;Its too bad that they cant just use natural ingredients in something so simple.<br />You can get the same bars with natural ingredients at trader joes or whole foods for much less.
5804;Weak Chai, But good.;I have a feeling the favorable reviews here are for Chai tea in general because honestly this Chai is not very good. Personally I don't like it, I prefer the Celestial Seasonings Chai which is closer to a Starbucks Chai latte.
5805;van houtte choclate rasberry k cups;I purchased a sample pack at christmas time and it was excellent.  This coffee is full of flavor and as a added bonus you can smell the rasberry while it is brewing.
5806;Say I Love You , then let it melt in your mouth;Imagine if you will a 1st grader in 1965.<br /><br />You first learn about the magic Necco Roll on the way to Bobbette's with your friends, it's all the answers you ever need.
5807;Unhappy;Price at Amazon entirely too expensive. Plus some of the canned dog food was hard, stale & my elk hound refused to eat it.
5808;Not bad;This tea is best hot..
5809;Cats won't touch them;I have 2 cats and neither would eat them without a pill in them. They are spoiled by the brand Temptations and don't like anything else for a treat.
5810;Bad tea;There is virtually no tea in the tea bags. Save your money and drink plain hot water it tastes about the same as adding tea.
5811;love this tea!;I have reordered this several times. After I brew a cup, I blend it with fruit and fresh ginger for a healthy, invigorating smoothie.
5812;Great price, but not as tangy as I expected.;"Chips are not as tangy as I hoped or expected. Poore Brothers is a better choice for the ""hard-core"" Salt N Vinegar fans."
5813;Berry, Berry Good;Contrary to popular belief, these are not just for baking. Not only are Oregon Blueberries loaded with antioxidants, they are delicious right out of the can.
5814;5 star product but cans are heavily dented;Of course the pumpkin tastes great but when I got my first order only 6 cans weren't severely dented/smashed.  Amazon was great and sent me a second order without question but there were 11 cans smashed in that one as well.
5815;Okay, for a not very strong coffee;"I like my coffee kind of medium, not too strong, not too weak, and these pods made fairly weak coffee.  I compare them to my own home made pods (using the ""Ecopad""  http://www."
5816;Great, high-quality cat food;I've tried a number of high-quality canned cat foods to supplement the dry food my cats always have available to them, and these appear to be the best as judged by me and the cats.  For one thing, these actually look like fish.
5817;smells awful;My cat does not seem crazy about it and I don't blame her..
5818;great product;"I purchased the Soda Stream (Starter Kit)  as a Father's Day gift for my husband. We both enjoy soda water, but there are only a few brands we've found which do not taste ""soapy."
5819;My Cats Savor Newman's Own Organics;It took some time, but I finally got my cats to savor Newman's Own Organics Adult Cat Dry Formula. (The green labeled bag is just as good).
5820;Nutiva Organic Extra Virgin Coconut Oil 54 once jar;IF you want to change you life for the better and loss weight naturally this is the product for you.  Highly recommend.
5821;Love these things!  Satisfies that salt craving...;Tasty little strips, slightly spicy, with great umami flavor.  Satisfies that salt craving, as they are from the sea, but don't taste or smell fishy.
5822;Best packaged pretzels ever;We had never eaten spelt before we ate these pretzels..
5823;Received the wrong item!! Again!!;I really the original Vita Coco, without any other flavors added. My last shipment was wrong! I received the one with Pineapple added to it which I have tried and do not like.
5824;Not the same Bold Flavor;I wish I hadn't ordered so many, they aren't the same bold flavor as the Nantucket Blend. It's like making a cup of coffee and you didn't put enough grounds in, kind of watered down.
5825;Great cocoa flavor like none other, but waaaaay tooo sweeeeet;"Whoah! I just peeled myself off the ceiling after drinking a cup of this. This might be better named ""Double Sugar"" Flavor Hot Chocolate mix."
5826;Excellent coffee;This is an excellent coffee. It has a full flavor but not overpowering.
5827;Bergin Nut;I guess I should have read that product description a bit better.  I didn't realize how many it contained.
5828;Prepare to chew;Please note that I think this product deserve 3 1/2 Stars rather than 4. But this is not star search and amazon wont let you.
5829;same food, less money;Great price, same food! Food arrived well packaged, quick, no problems. My cats like the food (it's really the same stuff) and I am glad to spend less and not have to go to the store.
5830;My honest opinion;This product is awful.  When I took a bite, they were slippery and slimy and there isn't any sauce or seasoning that will get me past that awful consistency.
5831;Blackberry Juice water;I bought this @ my grocery store and found it was a weak soda, but very tasty as a pop. It could be mixd in a tea or used in a punch mix too.
5832;Surprisingly Awesome;I never really expected to make anything but coffee in my Keurig.  But making tea was starting to get awfully inconvenient, comparatively.
5833;easy to use;Bags are sturdy enough for task and I like that they are biodegradable.  I have used these for a few years for my shepherd and lab.
5834;Great deal and quality;"Quinoa is a staple ""grain"" in my diet so this 10 pound bag/box was a great deal. There were no surprises with the product or delivery."
5835;Cold Weather Only;The good news is..
5836;My 16 month old and I eat these.;My little one has been eating these since she was about 10 months old. She didn't like the wheat ones and frankly, I like these barley ones better too.
5837;Excellent cookies;So yummy and easy to make.  All of their mixes are worth ordering.
5838;If you like bold coffee this is the one for you.;Nice wake up cup of coffee.  Good flavor.
5839;Average;Is this hot chocolate..
5840;Good filling, but crumbly crust;I loved the idea of buying a gluten-free fig bar. The flavor of the filling is great, but the cookie crumbles when bit into.
5841;Great taste;If you like bold taste..
5842;Honest Kitchen is honest goodness!;Bought this to add into my own meat mixture for the dogs and they just love it. It's easy to make in any size and really fast.
5843;my dog's favorite treat;These treats are a favorite with my 4 dachshunds and a beagle.  They absolutely love them and I love giving them a low fat high protein treat.
5844;Great product, great price;These are 12.99 plus tax at petco.
5845;Quality cat food at a great price;We have 3 cats and are on our third bag of this cat food. They all love it.
5846;Good, but not really kombucha;This drink is tasty and made with some pretty simple and natural ingredients. However, carbonation is added (in true kombucha it is a natural part of fermentation) and the drink is obviously pasteurized, which destroys any live culture (and thusly the probiotics that make kombucha popular as a health drink).
5847;caramel popcorn seasoning;This seasoning is fantastic. If you like caramel corn, you must buy this.
5848;licorice taste, twinings chai is much better;I am really disappointed in this chai tea. It has a distinct licorice taste.
5849;Favorite New Chew;My labradoodle absolutely loves these rawhide pretzels. He's a big chewer and usually gets through his rawhide chews within moments, but one of these will last him days without boredom.
5850;Awful;This peaberry is terrible.  They roasted it incorrectly I guess.
5851;Yum!;My family is from the West Indies.  This is a little sweeter than we're used to, but I would still say it's delicious.
5852;Good chips, terrible packaging;"Chips are good, but Amazon ships them in their original ""ready to ship"" box, which turns out is not really so ready for shipping. The box arrived in tatters"
5853;Green Mountain Sweet Lemon Black Perfect Iced Tea, 24-Count K-Cups for Keurig Brewers;This tea is my wifes favorite. A nicely balanced sweet tea that carries smooth flavor.
5854;Cat loves it;My cat is a picky eater and is also a 'licker' meaning that when he eats he just licks instead of bites. He won't eat chunky type cat food, he will just lick the juice up and then leave.
5855;Baby not yet sold;So we're 50-50 on this one. I think the price is reasonable, and I like the packaging.
5856;This is the worse Ethiopian coffee ever...;First off, this is a BLEND, and NOT pure Ethiopian coffee, which is not at all clear.  And when you open the bag, you can definitely see that it's a blend with beans of all different sizes and color.
5857;Great Price -- Great Product;Would NEVER know this is Sugar-Free -- being diabetic, this is a real treat for me and being able to be able to make something quickly that is also delicious -- is a total plus.<br /><br />Jell-O Instant is a PERFECT snack and Pistachio is my favorite flavor of all time.
5858;One of my very favorite flavors!;I love all of the Blue Diamond Almond flavors and they are my favorite snack. This one is one of my favorite flavors and I eat these almonds for a snack because I view them as being healthier than other types of snack foods.
5859;Clear Scalp Conditioner;I have shoulder length medium to thin hair. Weighing it down with heavy conditioners that cause it to look even thinner is unacceptable.
5860;Really Good;I seared mine when I got them just to add color and a little flavor (1 to 2 minutes on each side).  Extremely good flavor.
5861;Nice source of nutrition;I really like the flavor of these so I think I am a bit biased in favor of them.  They are a bit expensive, but for a product that has added antioxidants, and is gluten free, i then that's about right to cover the cost.
5862;Our dog loves the peanut butter flavor!;These Mini Naturals Peanut Butter flavor are a bit hit with our pup!  And the mini-size is perfect for treating good behavior.  I will buy more of these when she runs out of the several bags she received for Christmas.
5863;Outstanding Product!;Whip It is an outstanding product to keep whipping cream firm when exposed for long periods of time. e.
5864;Best tea I tried.;"Here at the office we started a ""tea catering club"", and we are actually hooked with Yogi teas. We have tasted over 15 different types but I have to say I like this the most."
5865;One of the best dog food out there.;I have a very picky puppy that would often rather starve himself, than to eat something he doesn't like. Because of that, he was becoming underweight and I decided to switch him away from dry kibble to have him gain some weight first before worrying bout his picky taste.
5866;Great flour, great price;I'm always looking for sales on Spelt flour.  This was the best price so far.
5867;Actually Bold;"Tried so many that called themselves ""bold"". But finally found one! We make it with a generous amount of water, and use half n half, and it is still very flavorful."
5868;A taste of Imperial Russia;I first had this tea served at the Firebird Resturant in New York. They served it in traditional Russian tea glasses with sweetened cherries from Moldavia (no sugar).
5869;Starburst FaveRed;For some reason, the stores have stopped selling this pack of starbursts, and it has been quite annoying.  I purchased this candy and have given them out to friends, and we are ALL quite happy.
5870;Yummy! & Healthy;These Apple Cinnamon Crisps taste so good! The crunchy snack I was looking for without any guilt and all the taste. These rock! The price of having them delivered is excellent especially since they are always out in local stores.
5871;Melitta Cafe Collection - Parisian Vanilla Ground Coffee;Typically I do not like flavored coffees, but this one is the exception.  It has a deeply fragrant aroma that is just simply heavenly.
5872;little dog continues to love this item;We've been receiving Cesar Canine Cuisine Variety pack for several months now..
5873;pigs fly;Luv em, hate buying them, but dogs live them. Keeps them busy at my dinner time, just be sure to always watch your pets when they get pig ear treats .
5874;Great tasting coffee at a great price;This coffee had a great taste and was purchased through Amazon at a fantastic price.<br />Wish I could get more.
5875;Excellent food for dogs with allergies;My golden|yellow lab mix was adopted from the shelter with a number of health issues including severe malnutrition, a pretty bad skin condition, and chronic  inflammation of the feet and face.  We placed him on an elimination diet and found that he was allergic to chicken, turkey and beef.
5876;Quick Shipping;I ordered these just a few days ago.  Haven't used them yet, but like this sellers attention to customer care.
5877;Vegan Organic Kosher Choice;Vegan. Organic.
5878;He ate them begrudgingly;"I was excited to offer these seemingly healthy treats to my dog, as I love other Newman's Own products such as their spaghetti sauce.  My dog Kirby was very excited as I opened the package and announced ""Ooooh, I have a treeeeeat for you!"" in the high pitched voice I use to get him worked up."
5879;Party mix is now one of my cat's favorite treats;"The various Friskies ""party mix"" flavors of treats really appeal to my cat's taste buds. They are his new favorites."
5880;bought it for the packaging - use it b/c it works;I'll admit it, I initially bought these because of the packaging. The design indicated to me that the makers believe they have a product that is truly different, and I think they're correct.
5881;Strong, delicious flavor!;I normally don't enjoy coffee, but this one is espresso-like in it's flavor. I have it every morning.
5882;Great coffee!;When I ordered this coffee, I wasn't sure it would be as good as the k-cups I had been using.  I was pleasantly surprised at the flavor and the freshness!  Of course the price was the best part.
5883;UTI;My husband is a paraplegic and was having UTIs constantly.  Since he started drinking a cup of this tea every morning, he hasn't had a UTI for a year.
5884;Best so far...;This is the best instant oatmeal I have tasted so far.  It is hearty and rib sticking.
5885;Delicious!;Surprisingly mild in flavor with a great texture as it is pleasantly crunchy.  It's delicious straight, but also works nicely when blended with other ingredients.
5886;Worth the Money;I have to disagree with other reviewers who said that the banana chips in this are the same as any other.  Normal banana chips are like eating rocks and are really tasteless.
5887;Very good and very spicy;These are great noodles.  However, the same product is made in both Korea and California.
5888;This is the foulest Tea ever;These reviews are wrong.It may work but I could not swallow this disgusting swill.
5889;This is good coffee;I was a little leery of this at first (who buys $40 a pound coffee, in a can, roasted in New Jersey, from Amazon) but I went ahead and ordered.  It's excellent Blue Mountain coffee.
5890;Not the cheapest....;I used to buy this stuff in the nice McCanns' cans. But you can get the exact same stuff much cheaper.
5891;Pure Himalayan Salt -  the healthy salt;I have been easily able to substitute Himalayan Salt with regular table salt for cooking, baking and flavoring my food at the table. I was on a special diet for esophagitis and starting using Himalayan Salt for its healing benefits.
5892;Yum Yum;Upon receiving these, I was very surprised regarding such good packaging of the product, but upon eating it was amazed. This vegetarian product is one of the nicest I have had the pleasure to enjoy for quite a while.
5893;Stashing this cake for later;After reading about pu'erh, and then tasting several kinds, I've decided I like the ripe teas better, but I'm open to new pathways, so I decided to get this one and stash it for a couple of years to experience the aging process for myself. It's a small cake, so storage shouldn't be too difficult, and it's a minimal investment , so I'm not out for much of a loss if I'm not too impressed when I do break it open.
5894;Why?;I have no idea why I bought this item online. It tasted like it had been shipped via Jupiter ie: terrible.
5895;Take care when you order-;After I purchased this for a gift, I was told that the enclosed cold pack had melted.  Soggy peppermint patties weren't the treats that I had intended to send.
5896;Delicious and filling!;Kashi GoLean Crunch! is really good. Seriously, truly tasty.
5897;A little goes a long way;"What a great idea - especially if you don't want soda calories, but something besides plain water.  Two ""squirts"" is all I need in a Sigg water bottle to provide the flavor that I need."
5898;Wheat Grass Powder;Next best thing to drinking fresh-juiced wheat grass. I love to grow wheat grass and juice it myself.
5899;Road Trip Companion;I like good coffee and when I find it I stick with it.  Nonetheless, when a chance comes along to try something different, I'm willing to give it a try.
5900;Great Tahini;I'm not an expert on Tahini. In fact, this is the first Tahini I've ever purchased, but I really enjoyed this brand.
5901;Great Buy!;Placed the order on July 15th, delivery was suppose to be Monday, July 23, 2012 but was delivered on Sat, July 21st which was a nice surprise especially since the shipping was free. Recipient was very happy with the gift, the selection, the assortment.
5902;"""Sturdy"" comes to mind as the best description!";"If asked to sum up this coffee-pod drawer in one word, ""sturdy"" would be my enthusiastic answer. It is one hefty piece of metal sliding-drawer perfection - it weighed in at 4 lbs."
5903;Excellent Quality;This condiment ROCKS! Tasty, spicy and hot.  Loving it.
5904;Great Bars;These bars are great for backpacking trips! I love the natural ingreients because they agree with my digestive tract. In the past certain bars have been hard on my stomach, but these have never given me any trouble.
5905;Great product!;This is a great vegetarian meat to add to anything you would add chicken to.  Definitely a great substitute for meat.
5906;Thank you Betty Crocker;Thank you Betty Crocker for a product that is simple to prepare and one that might soon be available in mainstream markets.  Received mine through Amazon yesterday and promptly made them up as directed.
5907;Yee-ouch!;I love spicy food and this stuff is crazy hot!  Goes well with just about any salsa or sauce and you don't need much so it lasts quite a while.  Enjoy, but be aware that the shipping cost is a bit high.
5908;Organic, gluten-free and tasty?  Can it be?;As a big fan of Nature's Path products, I was excited to try a new flavor from them.  But gluten-free and breakfast cereal aren't a normal combination for me.
5909;Yes, I buy the bulk size;This pasta is hot enough that with an appropriate sauce, such as a Thai peanut sauce, it's hard to stop eating.  I add fried sweet potatoes and garden serranos.
5910;Dee-lish;I just got my box today and brewed a cup after work. It's one of my favorite k-cups yet!! I recommend it.
5911;This am yummy, boy!;Seriously -- A while back I eliminated all cereals with added sugar and went looking for healthy stuff that I could stand eating. This cereal has become one of my favorites.
5912;Very good;I bought this based on reviews.  It really seems to work.
5913;Extremely good pasta!;My daughter is gluten intolerant and we have tried many GF pastas.  This is by far the best!!  When reheated, as in a casserole, the texture is just like fresh.
5914;Drinkable, but not what I was expecting;For the money, I think this Folgers series of coffees is pretty tasty -- I've had 3 different ones now.  However, I was expecting a better chocolate flavor based on the other reviews it's received.
5915;Mmm mmm good!;I think these nuts are amazing!! They're just a perfect balance of sweet and salty and crunchy. I bought a bag on a whim one day and went back the next day and bought 6 bags (to stock up).
5916;Foolproof jams at a lower price;Pomona's Pectin has really been foolproof for me in making jam, jelly, and marmalade.  It works with significantly reduced sugar, unlike most pectin that needs a lot of sugar to activate it.
5917;Love this Honey;This is one of the best tasting Honeys you would ever want. I buy a lot of honey and this by far is one of my favorites.
5918;Quality not what you find at local retailers;I purchased two types, the original and the salt and vinegar. The original tasted burned, they were very tan/brown in color.
5919;Those with true allergies will and do appreciate this product gurateed:);Yes..
5920;Such a disappointment;I bought this because a coffee shop in the area has a delicious carmel apple cider, and I mistakenly thought this was going to be as good.  It's not.
5921;"Not truly an ""alfredo"", but not without merit";First, this is a zero calorie, diet product.  I think anyone purchasing this product must fully understand that concept before tasting it.
5922;BEST ESPRESSO;I USED LAVAZZA COFFEE BLACK CAN,IT WAS 5 STAR NOW ALLESSI, JUST IS BETTER 6 STARS,NEVER BITTER, SMOOTH TASTE, GREAT CAPICCCINO.i also mix the two brands together also great tasting.
5923;Makes Super Gluten-Free Scones;Made a batch of scones from this mix just this morning. Had to improvise because I didn't have any buttermilk.
5924;Wonderful soup!!;I was really satisfied with this soup.  I was actually surprised that it tasted as wonderful as it did.
5925;worst energy drink i've tried;I don't know if it's just me, but this is the worst energy drink I've ever tried - it did nothing for me at all!  Granted, I love coffee and energy drinks so I may have a bit of a tolerance, but even my fiance who never drinks coffee and hates all red bull-type drinks drank a whole can and did not feel any boost at all.  It seems like it works for some ppl, but my experience was extremely disappointing.
5926;The Best Wasabi Peas!!!;After not being able to find Wasabi peas in my area, I turned to the internet. I was so surprised when Amazon's link came up.
5927;AWESOME;I've been snacking on these for a couple of years now.  I can no longer get them in a grocery store, so I have to order them on Amazon.
5928;I wonder what others were talking about?;I didn't like this coffee at all.  I like strong, full-flavored coffee and this is not it.
5929;Pretty darn tasty;These cookies are a perfect snack for when you wish to get a 'fix' of something cookie-like.  They do not have the richness of a real shortbread cookie but for a 100-calorie snack they are simply more than good enough.
5930;A good dirty martini;the last case (a different brand)we ordered from Amazon was so terrible we threw away the entire case.  However, the Boscoli brand is very good and we can enjoy a good dirty martini.
5931;Cinnamon better than any found on any food store shelf .;Best cinnamon I have found and used in over 45 years of Baking.<br />I am a repeat customer for this Frontier Cinnamon Powder (Korintje / A Grade (3% oil).
5932;Weak, weak, weak;Because Senseo is not providing a good dark coffee anymore, I bought this based on reviews here, and got the smallest amount possible.  It is very weak, and makes no crema in my Senseo maker.
5933;New formula (Aug, 2008) is no good;This was a fine food until some time in early August, 2008. I bought two bags, this formula for my old, 140 lb dog, and lamb meal and rice for my 1 year old.
5934;Breakfast Blend;This Breakfast Blend from Green Moutain coffee company is my favorite flavor of coffee when I just want a regular cup of coffee without that extra kick from a bold blend or a flavored coffee.  It has always been consistent and calming in its flavor.
5935;Great Product!;I like to keep a pitcher of iced green tea in the house (very refreshing and healthful) and have found Luzianne to be the tastiest.  The large tea bags are very efficient
5936;Just like remember !;Being French I grew up knowing how important it was to use a good unrefined salt. The one from Brittany being the very best.
5937;Great Stuff;This Agave Nectar is great.  I use it to sweeten my tea and other beverages.
5938;Dogs love them;My dog is now permanently on meds and it was impossible to get them down her.  The Vet recommended Pill Pockets but I found the stores are often out of them.
5939;Product has changed;"I used to think these were basically ""potato crack"" but they have changed the way they process them with my last batch.  They seemed flat and overcooked."
5940;unsweet tea;My family loves tradewinds unsweet tea.We live in Middletown NY.
5941;outdated package;This item was dated 0709, and was stale to the point of being rancid. It also looked as though it had been melted at some point.
5942;its ok but not bufala;This is not bufala mozz. it does not say its bufala it says fresh mozz.
5943;Good, but oily;Coffee flavor and aroma are good, and I like the organic/fair trade designations. I've sampled dozens of specialty coffees from Amazon.
5944;Organic popcorn;I have been looking for tender, crispy popcorn for some time.  I decided to try this popcorn since it was organic.
5945;Great coffee;I tried alot of coffee i like it strong but not bitter.This is good stuff.
5946;NOT a Black Bean chip!;"Although labeled ""Black Bean Chips,"" unlike the (now unavailable) Trader Joe's version these are CORN chips with some black bean thrown in.  That's misleading."
5947;Not the best of all the Go Raw Chips;I love all the other flavors I've tried, but these have a VERY strange after-taste to me.  Also, the Banana flavor overpowers all the other ingredients.
5948;Horrible packaging;8 out of 12 cans damaged. Try smaller packaging, please!  Hope these cans open at the bottom.
5949;One of Knorr's best!;You simply can't go wrong with Knorr! This particular sauce mix is absolutely the greatest for pork dishes.  Having previously lived in Germany for nearly 30 years, I know that both this brand, as well as sauce mixes made by Maggi, are used in many gaste houses (restaurants) throughout Europe to create those delicious cream sauces found on e.
5950;Good product, but canned versions are more moist;Let me explain that title.  Given how the products are sealed and cooked in the container in their own natural juices, there is as much juice per ounce (allowing for variation in each fish) in both the canned and pouched versions.
5951;Scottish Breakfast Tea;Very happy with the Scottish Breakfast Tea
5952;Classic thin Scottish oatcakes;These are really good with cheese, or jam, honey or perhaps best of all, with homemade lemon curd!  Yes, they are crisp, very dry and rather crumbly but that is exactly how they should be.  I have never been able to find proper Scottish oatcakes in my part of the USA so it was a thrill to be able to get these through Amazon.
5953;The best cup of coffee that I've brewed at home.;I typically prefer espresso when I drink coffee beverages. However, when my in-laws bought me the Keurig I decided to start drinking regular coffee.
5954;Good for packaged soup!;This is really great for a quick and easy soup.  I have a bunch of canned chicken in my pantry because I normally don't eat canned chicken.
5955;Tried everything....this REALLY does what it says...;My husband and I have tried several different drinks and pills to enhance our love life and spice things up. All of which to no avail.
5956;too sweet;What do they add?  Is it the marshmallow root?  (There's no stevia.)  This tea has a sickening sweetness all its own.
5957;Good spread;My son survives on this stuff. It's very chocolaty.
5958;Great product.;Makes PHENOMENAL chai tea lattes if you've got a milk steamer. Add a few shots of espresso for a dirty chai and you've got a 4$ drink for under a buck.
5959;My kid didn't like them...but I loved them.;My 4 yr old daughter disliked these. But, I have been snacking on them since I received them.
5960;Best canned black beans!;The best because Eden use BPA free can for their canned beans + being organic. What else do you need? The price of the subscription of this item is not bad per can compared to the price you pay at regular grocery store for a canned organic beans.
5961;Saturated Fat Nightmare;With all the reviews of this popcorn, I'm surprised not to find any mention of the horrible saturated fat content of this. Anyone with any concern about their cholesterol or saturated fat content really needs to look closely at the nutritional guide.
5962;good stuff;Mr. Yoshida's Original Gourmet Sweet and Savory Marinade  is verry good for cooking out steaks ribs if you have not try it you don't know what your missing.
5963;Charley Bear Treats;We had been giving our dog the Liver Biscotti, and as I wrote in my review, those seemed to be difficult for her to chew.  So, I decided to try these Charley Bear treats.
5964;Great black tea!;I really like the flavor of this tea for hot tea and for iced tea! It does not seem to get bitter if you forget and leave the tea bag in overly long. Oh, and the shape of the bag allows the tea leaves to expand and the water to flow through them better than other shapes of bags.
5965;A great deal on great popcorn.;This would probably seem like too much popcorn to buy, but it's a great gift. My friends and family loved it.
5966;Strangely yummy;My daughter is a nut for Japanese things, and had to have these candies.  I tried them also.
5967;Great, if you like dead.;Amazing that you can orders these online, but it died within 3 weeks. I took care of it just like they said to.
5968;Relish;One of the best Jalepeno relishes we've come across.  A wonderful addition to almost any table fare.
5969;loved by 20yo dd;I decided to give this healthy cereal a try although I am a sweet cereal lover. I recognized corn puffs and crisped rice
5970;love vidal chicken feet;I am thrilled to see these online, they can be hard to find. They are very tasty and I have several friends who also crave these tasty treets.
5971;I like it!;This is good!  No, you probably don't want to use the largest setting because it will water it down, but I like this.  It's creamy and sweet and just the thing after a hard day at work.
5972;All The Flavor I Remembered;The Banana Split Taffy candy was delicious and full of that old time banana flavor. It was very sticky though.
5973;Big bag, Great Taste;The same great taste! I looked for Life Savers in several stores.<br />Apparently Live Savers do not sell well enough for stores to stock them anymore.
5974;Beneficial;I've been using Turmeric powder for years after I read how beneficial it is for many health problems.  Prevention  is my way, whenever possible, to combat the possibilities.
5975;Delicious and easy;This is a very tasty soup indeed, and it makes a LOT- at least 6-8 hearty meals, made according to the directions, and more if one added corn or another vegetable to it (corn or lightly cooked onions would be good
5976;Best K-cup Coffee!;I bought the Kuerig because I love the Dunkin Original and Green Mountain Nantucket Blend.  Rodeo Drive has now become my favorite.
5977;Wonderful sampling;Sample this box of 10 teabags. It's a lovely sweetish, spicy tea that's great hot or cold.
5978;Happiness wrapped in plastic!;This is a wonderful snack to have whenever you have a craving for something to munch.  Each box contains 8 individually wrapped biscotti.
5979;Great Stuff;If you enjoy the mustard typically found in 'vats' :-) at Chinese restaurant buffets, this is for you. It is killer good and wicked hot.
5980;Not what I was expecting;Full disclosure I am a do it yourself popcorn newb.  Made this in a wok with canola oil (no fancy machine).
5981;Disappointed;Truly had higher expectations of the flavor with this coffee.  Not real smooth and a bit bitter.
5982;quality lightly sweetened green tea powder;lots of uses for this green tea..
5983;Too Salty;It doesn't taste very fishy at all. The fish becomes just a vehicle for the spices, which are quite strong.
5984;CHOCOLATE YUMM!;I'VE ORDERED THIS PRODUCT THRU AMAZON A NUMBER OF TIMES NOW AND I'M NEVER SORRY.  THIS IS A YUMMY PRODUCT THAT MIXES UP TO SATISFY A CHOCOLATE LOVER'S DESIRE.
5985;Do not like the taste.  Amazon packaging is great.;I read all the nice reviews here before i made the purchase.  But it is really not my 'cup of tea'.
5986;Best way to give pills!!;My dog loves Pill Pockets! They make giving medication so easy. Just wrap it around the pill and your dog will take it and beg for more.
5987;GREAT FOOD;I have a VERY fussy English Springer Spaniel. She tried so many foods, I lost count.
5988;Coffee Kava the Best and Smoothest;I have been drinking Kava Coffee for 10 years and lately it has been difficult to find a store selling it.  I am excited andextremely pleased that I found it at Amazon.
5989;Great Pancakes;I have been searching for this pancake mix since my son gave us a package several years ago. I like to embed pieces of fruit in the pancake and our searches for a mix that would allow this have been failures.
5990;Maybe better as a mix;This Kellogg's Crunchy Nut is very nutty. The cereal is good, slightly sweet and has lots of flavor.
5991;We Love Zukes!;We started off our dog with Zuke's Mini treats as puppy rewards. Now that she is bigger, she needs more.
5992;A Delicious Tea at an Amazing Price!;I cannot get over the deal you can get when you participate with the Amazon Subscribe & Save program for this tea!  If you are nervous about commitment, don't be!  You can cancel at any time.  You can change your preferences any time as well!  On top of that, the tea ships for free & you don't have to worry about remembering to order more!  Or if you are running low, you can opt.
5993;Can't even touch Haribo;I wont say they are terrible but, not even close to Haribo quality. Decided to try em on a whim.
5994;Disappointed;These sounded good, but lack favor.  Not worth the price.
5995;Not good;This is not even tea, it is not even as good as dipping a tea bag in the cup once. It's You'll be drinking hot water with sugar and honey.
5996;Fabulous flavor!  Like real tomatoes.;I am Italian and make my own spaghetti sauce.  Needless to say, I am picky about my ingredients.
5997;Best Coffee Ever!;Green Mountain Dark Magic is delicious coffee! I love starting my day off with this coffee. I highly recommend you try this coffee.
5998;excellent product.  low salt and good nutrition;I use this a my vegetable drink every morning.  I put the can contents into a blender and pulverize it into a paste.
5999;Peace and Cheese go great together.;Annie's Homegrown Organic Peace Pasta with parmesan is an excellent product. Not only are the shapes fun for the kids, but the taste is excellent.
6000;Easy Organic Mango Puree;I am the only one in the house who enjoys cutting up a fresh mango and getting messy. But sometimes I don't plan ahead and I run out of time to puree my mangos.
6001;price went WAY up!;I like this. It was $33.
6002;My dog is the one that I listen to...;My dog Annie had surgery about 2 months ago and ever since its been hard to get her to eat anything.  I was worried for a while because every kind of dogfood i brought home she wouldn't eat.
6003;Timothy's is Great Coffee;The Timothy's Decaffeinated coffee, has a great taste with out any bitterness. The coffee is full bodied and flavorful regardless of the size brewed.
6004;Best decaf i have tried in a KCup;I have tried Donut Shop decaf (only b/c my mom said it was good..
6005;Solid 4.5 stars for these...Tasty & Great Texture!;Hesitantly, I ordered these in a case (12 cans) on our 1st try. What a pleasant surprise! They are very tasty and the texture is great.
6006;Tasty and convenient;We love Silk milk products but cannot find the smaller 8-oz. size unless we make a special trip very far away to the health food store.
6007;Not what I purchased;I received a completely different product than I ordered. The product is similar but is a different brand and does not taste good.
6008;Just read review, then buy your own;This is about the 4th re-order of Breakfast blend K-cups from Amazon.  I think that itself is the best review I can think of.
6009;Easy and healthy snack!;These snacks are great for on-the-go, and they are low in sugar.  My toddler really enjoys them.
6010;"My fave of the Campbell ""light"" soups";This is a very nice soup for those watching calories and wanting a scosh less salt than is usual for Campbell's soups. It's a tomato-based soup with a light dose of rice, black beans, and chicken.
6011;Delicious;This coffee is delicious, and very affordable as compared to most flavored pods.  I would recommend it.
6012;Perfect party giveaway!;I ordered two boxes of these and I thought the distribution was pretty decent for a birthday party giveaway.  Between the two boxes we received 3 Yodas, 7 R2D2s, 3 General Grievouses, 1 Anakin, 5 C3POs, 1 Clonetrooper and 4 Aserkas.
6013;Give me samoa, please!;These vanilla cookies are coated in caramel, sprinkled with toasted coconut and laced with chocolate stripes. They take me back to the days when my sister sold Girl Scout Caramel deLites (aka.
6014;Perfect and delcious!!;We have always loved this popcorn but couldn't find it..
6015;"The other ""O"" cereal";Nature's Path Organic Heritage O's cereal stay crunchy until the last one is eaten and knowing they are better for you than that other O cereal makes it all the better. Great taste.
6016;Great Food;this is a food loved by the very young to the very old. It is a great price.
6017;What Nobody Tells You About RAW Maca...;I have never written a review before but I always consult Amazon.com reviews before buying a product so thought I would give back at least once.
6018;the best so far;I have had a Keurig for over a year and have tried many of the different k cups.  So far, this has been the best k-cup.
6019;A Pleasant Surprise;These sugar-free chocolates turned out to be of much higher quality than I expected they would be.  I liked the variety and taste better than that in the sugar-free chocolate assortments you can find at drugstores and grocery stores, as well as some I have purchased in candy stores such as Anthony Thomas.
6020;My dogs love these cookies!;I have small dogs (Maltese) and these cookies are just the right size for tiny mouths.  I love that they are made in AMERICA and from quality ingredients.
6021;Beautiful smell and beautiful design;I love this product because I can put it on when I get up in the morning and work all day and it is still doing its job by late evening. I love the smell of it.
6022;"Lipton's Sucralose Sweetened ""To Go"" Stix - Not A Fan...";I LOVE tea!  I love Lipton tea! I do not love Lipton To Go Stix tea..
6023;Addictive!;I love wasabi..
6024;Very good pads;These pads are reasonably priced, and they taste just about as good as the Illy.  It's nice that they are individually packed, if one only drinks occasionally.
6025;Wonderful ginger and lemon flavor;"An ""herbal"" type tea, with real ginger and some lemon flavors, including lemongrass.  Also contains safflower, hibiscus, and some soy."
6026;Not up to my expectations;I purchased a quart carton of chamomile tea at a street fair about 2 years ago.  I started using it a few months ago and it was excellent, in spite of its age.
6027;Perfect for popcorn, but take care when ordering;The fine grind of the salt is perfect for popcorn however, BUYER BEWARE, when this is packed it is with anything else you just bought..
6028;Surprisingly Better Than Others;I didn't think it could get better than T*******'s Strawberry Licorice, but somehow, Newman's Own did it.  These are great.
6029;Lots of twizzlers, just what you expect.;My daughter loves twizzlers and this shipment of six pounds really hit the spot. It's exactly what you would expect.
6030;Bigelow - more flavorful than the other Oolong bag teas;I have tried numerous brands of packet Oolong tea, such as Twining, Choice Organic, etc. but each time I have been disappointed by the flavor.
6031;Very Good But Not Great;The delivery of the product was quick and free.  The product came bubble wrapped, very securely, for shipment.
6032;Awesome!;Recently removed caffeine from my diet I thought life was over, until I found these Twinnings Earl Grey Decaffeinated K-Cups. The flavor is great, convenience is awesome and the value is much better than I have found anywhere else.
6033;Dog loves it but......;After two years on Eukanuba lamb and rice i thought i would try a different food for my choc lab just to give him a bit of variety.<br />He likes the food alot not surprisingly but the difference is after three weeks of eating it is that he is alot hungrier than he was before, his poop is alot looser, he is thirstier and his breath is not good.
6034;Brilliant;It is an excellent product, the presentation is beautiful and I am very satisfied with the purchase. My whole family loved it.
6035;Wonderful smell, great taste.;I'm rather new to drinking tea. I first tried Pickwick Purely Peach while at work.
6036;Exquiste;I received this basket as a gift.  I enjoyed every bit of it
6037;Set the record straight...;So the first time that I had coconut water was in college.  It all started with a cold tetra pack of vita coco and I have been hooked ever since.
6038;Superb;Delicious, especially toasted. I was a little apprehensive about purchasing so many English Muffins at one time, but they stay fresh.
6039;Love;Can't say enough about these products..
6040;Good Product;Used this in my Cuisinart and brewed an 8-cup pot. Also used it in a perculator.
6041;Works Great!;Clear Scalp & Hair Ultra Shea Oil is great!  It really does instantly soothe and nourish the scalp for quick relief from dryness. Can be used on wet or dry hair as often as needed.
6042;like the taste;My girlfriend and I prefer Lavazza over anything. We prefer the crema that Lavazza seems to produce better than other brands.
6043;Gummi Bears;I like gummi bears,but not theses. Some of them tasted awful! Some were hard!!!!!!!!! I wont buy them again.
6044;Tabasco is the best... Forget others.;I am a fan of spices..
6045;Great Stuff;Good-tasting bars that are both filling and healthy.  They work well either as a meal replacement or snack.
6046;Choclat Mints;They were smaller than I thought they would be. They taste good, but again they are kind of small.
6047;Taste Great;Got at a great price.  A little slow (backordered) but worth the wait (savings).
6048;Beautiful and tasty;My mother loves dried fruit, and was thrilled with this fruit tray. It was as beautiful as in the pictures, and the quality of the fruit was unrivaled.
6049;Nice product, nice gift-giving option;"The four jams come tucked in a simple, white, square cardboard carton with a green label.  While it isn't snazzy in any way, it is very ""giftable"" - easy to wrap, or just add a nice ribbon."
6050;Community Coffee;Arrived on time, intact, no problems. The one coffee where a pound is still 16 ozs.
6051;I love coconut water, but this is not good at all.;I really thought the reviews were mixed because some people just don't like coconut water, so I ordered this.  It is NOT good at all.
6052;Excellent taste;My husband and I both like coffee with rich flavor and good taste, but we do not like the bitter or burnt taste some coffees have.  This Community Hazelnut has excellent flavor.
6053;yummy;"These are good. the sour flavor is good, although im not sure if its ""the most sour"" candy, but that may be because the whole time i was waiting for my package to show up i was psyching myself up for these to be crazy sour."
6054;"A movie to ""literally die for!!!""";Beetlejuice is not a movie that you can't watch under . .
6055;Buy with caution from PLEXSUPPLY;Product is fantastic, a delicious and healthful snack. BUT read the description carefully - even though it sounds like you will be getting a box with 7 packs in it you will only receive ONE pack.
6056;best chocolate;this is my favourite chocolate ever.  creamy melt in your mouth texture.
6057;Delicious - and loose leaf is the only way to go.;Irish Breakfast is a traditional black tea blend known for its assertiveness and malty flavor.  It's a wonderful tea - i prefer it with a touch of milk, but it's not overpowering when drunk black.
6058;good!;i am a little bit dissapointed with the product because some of it's features are not user friendly.like the knob for blending/grinding.
6059;I like salty;I'm known to be a salty person, so that may be why I like this so much. This is so much better than chewy jerky.
6060;Wellness means top quality;We have tried a number of different Wellness dry dog mixes, and our Wheaten Terrier loves them all, but this one is his favorite. I love the fact that it isn't 90% grain, which most cheap and expensive dog foods seem to feel is great filler.
6061;The best;This crispbread is enjoyed every day. It doesn't get any better.
6062;Good honey;Good testing honey. The description claims that they do not overheat it, if it is true then it is great product for the price.
6063;Jelly Belly Flops;I bought this for my son-in-law.  He loves Jelly Belly's but said that the flops are just as good.
6064;These are AWESOME!;These are some of the best chips that I have ever had..
6065;Happy Customer;Got started drinking this tea in Ireland and find it very refreshing and delicious. Ordered this from Amazon and am delighted with it.
6066;Great Stuff!;Not knowing a thing about this product, I was unsure what to expect.  That said, it was a pleasant surprise to find MIO Mango Peach so flavorful.
6067;Great popcorn, a little salty;The popcorn arrived the same day as our new Great Northern Foundation 8 oz popcorn machine. While using these packets couldn't be simpler, they are just a smidge too wide for easy access to the preheated popping bucket.
6068;Good stuff, great price, lovely start to the day;This plain flavor is a welcome alternative to so many over-sweetened and overprocessed quick oatmeals.  I pour this into a glass Pyrex 2-cup measuring cup, add water, microwave for about 2 minutes, and mix in some ground flax seed for a little extra flaxiness.
6069;Insanely Good.;Literally bought these on a whim, and am super happy that I did.<br /><br />They taste like they already have the perfect amount of cream, and are good to go right off the bat.
6070;Strawberry Pocky:;I love Strawberry Pocky it is my favorite desert.<br />I love the Flavor Strawberry,  in general.
6071;Not bad;I got 2 packs of these.  One for a friend who is a huge fan of Dr.
6072;Greenies;You cant go wrong with greenies! My dogs love them and go nuts on them. Only downside to this is that its so soft it gets chewed up quickly so i dont quite see how this will improve the dogs teeth and gums.
6073;A Little Gummy;While I love having the opportunity to make my own gluten-free pizza dough from an easy mix, I found the end result a little gummy and chewy..
6074;Best Hot Cocoa;Grove Square is the best k-cup hot cocoa I've tried.  And I've tried a number of the other brands.
6075;Just great.;This bowl is so good. That I get my wife to ship it to me in Iraq.
6076;Very disappointed;The seasoning was very difficult to shake out of container as it appeared to be stuck together. I suspect this product was outdated, although wasn't able to find a an expiration date on the container.
6077;Just so-so;I made cupcakes with this mix for my son. He liked them ok, but we found them a little dense and dry.
6078;Lucky bambo working;I purchased a cute little bambo plant, known to bring luck,  for my daughter who was having lots of bad luck. Well, it took afew weeks after it arrived but her luck did improve.
6079;Newest Snack Obsession!;First off, I'd like to say that this review is for the ALMOND BUTTER NUT BUTTER BALLS (gluten-free, vegan). I noticed that some of the reviews are for the different varieties, but this is the specific one I am doing.
6080;Good Strong Cup of Coffee;Good, strong cup of coffee.  I agree, it seems to have a lot of caffeine.
6081;LOVE it.;I love these decaf. Its so clean, smooth and delish.
6082;Clif Crunch Bar;I love these things! Usually they go on sale on Amazon and I only buy them when they are about $6 - 7 for the pack of two. My favorite kind is the white chocolate macadamia nut.
6083;Good choice;This is a reasonable price for mail order meat.  The taste is pretty mild (maybe a little too mild)and the texture is consistent with summer sausage which is a cooked product, not a dry cured product like salami.
6084;Taste Good, Not Filling;The one thing that I look for in a drink is that it tastes good.  I know you take that for granted when you buy anything that has flavor, but I have purchased some drinks that taste like swamp water, or worse.
6085;good stuff!;This product works very well. It taste great.
6086;I'm ordering more . . .;We first bought these from a local health food store because my son had food allergies.  Kids love them.
6087;good tea;The tea is good and fresh. We enjoy it.
6088;GREAT!!;Bought these for breakfast but have them as snacks all the time..
6089;Thrilled;I was thrilled to find this product and even more thrilled when it turned out to be very good.  My pantry now has a number of Fiber Gourmet pastas and it's all we use now.
6090;Hetrbal Teas,Chamomile;This is an outstanding product!! The test is great and lives up to it's ancient name Roman Apples. Altogether  a warm comfortable taste and calming nature.
6091;KEEPS THE BUGS AWAY;My property is surrounded by tidal water and woods. Needless to say, there is an abundance of flying and biting critters.
6092;Bangin' Almonds;First tried these at my work vending started buying them everyday $1.25 per 2ozs.
6093;The best gingernaps, the best sugarfree cookies.;I love these cookies, wish I could find them, I buy lots every time I find them..
6094;Great tasting-YES.. pecan pie flavor-not so much;I really, really, really like pecans. These are very good, but I wouldn't say they taste like pecan pie.
6095;Not much vanille taste;I expected a nice rich vanilla cappucino flavor, instead got a very weak taste. Very disappointing.
6096;Liptons' Best Chai Tea;Lipton's best kept secret is their Chai Tea. I had to order from Amazon.
6097;Superb;My Italian Greyhound loves these treats and it makes him so calm without any side effects. I first bought Mellow Mut at Whole Foods, but they stay sold out.
6098;The Boy Loves Them!;All kids like animal crackers, don't they? Well our three-year-old boy certainly does. So my wife picked up a 7.
6099;taste great with Jasmine rice together;I found that cooking quinoa with Jasmine rice together, the texture is better and taste is great.<br /><br />First puting rice in rice cooker (must add a little more water than normal).
6100;great product;My dogs love this treat. Great price for a 16-qunce bag.
6101;Not fit for birds;My god how can you like this crap, dried out, tasteless, and sickening.  Would not feed this stuff to a bird or any other form of wildlife for fear of a massive reprisal.
6102;Makes a Keurig affordable!;We were skeptical when we ordered, and received, this product.  It doesn't look like it would fit a Keurig, and is not our top brand coffee.
6103;HOT COFFEE;WHILE BARISTA ITALIAN ROAST COFFEE IS A BIT PRICIER THAN MOST OF THE KEURIG'S STYLE COFFEES, IT HAS A GREAT RICH FLAVOR AND IS WORTH IT.<br /><br />BY ACCIDENT, I RAN A SECOND CUP OF WATER THROUGH THE KEURIG ON A PREVIOUSLY USED K-CUP.
6104;Try the teas;I really like all of the flavors but the Green Teas are my favorite. They give me a really nice boost in the middle of the day.
6105;Great flavor, and not watery like some other flavored k-cups;I'm very happy with the two Gloria Jean's flavors I've tried (this one and Cappucino).  So many of the other flavored K-cups come out very watery when you brew the larger cup size.
6106;interesting shipment;All the products arrived on-time including a second box with a book item that I didnt order and was meant for a customer in Wisconsin.<br />After emailing amazon they send me a link to go and print off a return label.
6107;Love These Nuts;Great flavor. I have always ordered Blue Diamond wasabi almonds but these come in a convenient snack bag I can throw in my purse.
6108;Bold, Not Extra Bold.  Slightly Bitter.;A bold, but not a super bold blend. This coffee has a bitter edge and a bit of an acidic aftertaste, so it is not one of my favorite k-cups.
6109;Great get together idea;The mberry tablets worked great.  We tried a lot of the suggested pairings and most of them had some sort of fun taste after eating the tablets.
6110;A taste of Canada;Brought a couple of packages of this home from my last trip to visit my mum.  Wow was I surprised - it was great.
6111;"They shoud re-name this the ""Tug-A-Huh?""";I have two dogs: one is not very good at figuring out puzzle toys, even with scaffolding and attempts at teaching him, the other is like a dog genius. That, coupled with her highly food driven motivation, usually leads to her mastering these types of treat toys instantly.
6112;The best green tea you can buy for the price.;This green tea is not brewed and then the leaves thrown out. You drink the whole leaf crushed into a powder getting all the phytonutrients and benefits that tea bags cannot give you.
6113;Great Low Carb & Fiber Alternative for Atkins & Diabetic's;Seller ships quickly & great bargain compared to supermarket prices & grinding the raw seeds yourself. There are recipes online for a Focaccia flat bread & we just made some muffins with walnuts & almonds that turned out pretty good.
6114;great for diaper rash and whatever ails you!;I bought this product because I read that organic coconut oil helps heal and sooth diaper rash.  Not only did it work amazingly, but I love how it smells.
6115;Not worth the money;I bought one of these thinking I would try it out and go back for more if it worked out.  They are cute, but I won't be buying more.
6116;nut nut;Can't live without peanut butter and now I don't have to. Great peanutty taste without the over the top fat grams.
6117;Filler food is empty, leaves your cat always needing more;This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes.
6118;Best cocoa powder ever;I use this for making hot chocolate every morning, very smooth and satisfying.  Use whole milk and a little of brown sugar.
6119;Bon App&eacute;
6120;Wholesome Rawhide Donut;Got a pretzel instead.  Wanted the donut.
6121;MY FAVORITE I LOVE IT !!!!!!;This is my favorite tdisc, I love it..
6122;Just Right;Nantucket Blend is my favorite. Not too strong yet has that satisfying flavor.
6123;Weak Flavoring = FAIL;The fruit punch is a watered down cheap bubblegum taste. Not to the standards of the older Supercharge formula with good fruit punch taste.
6124;Monkey Spunk!;"So much for trying to be ""green"" and saving a buck. This stuff is pure garbage."
6125;Newman's Own Turkey & Vegetable Catfood;I have four cats with differing tastebuds/likes.  They all enjoyed this product, and there was no waste.
6126;I really wanted to like this...;but unfortunately, it was, to me, really unpalatable. I'm generally not picky when it comes to sugar substitutes - I get that nothing is going to match sugar exactly in taste.
6127;Haven't recieved in a month!;Im not a tea lover, but this Tastes better than I thought! I'm looking forward to trying other Yerba mate  flavors.<br />.
6128;Love these beans;My sister got me onto these beans which I cannot find anywhere else.  They are so good, not to mention how convenient and easy they are.
6129;The biscuits are 5 stars, but the packaging is horrible with open gaps.;****Food Safety Alert****<br /><br />(see my pictures)<br /><br />I have asked amazon.com to update the product pictures, just like I have posted here over the months.
6130;Great for college kids;With two sons in college, I love these 1.5 ounce cup sizes to send them.
6131;Great flavored tea;This rosehip tea is surprisingly good, reminds me slightly of rhubarb with a subtle regular black tea undertone. The package did take 9 days to arrive & it was all crushed up inside the jiffy-bag so it's a good job it wasn't ordered as a gift.
6132;Excellent!;The crisps are awesome. Give me English crisps over american chips any day! I recommend them to everyone.
6133;One of the best;By far one of the best K-cup coffees.<br />The favor is bold yet not bitter, it is not not weak or diluted even when choosing the largest cup size on the Keurig machine.
6134;Good, but lots of Hulls!;The popcorn tastes great and is easy to cook in a hot air popper. The hulls are very hard and there are a lot of them.
6135;My morning cup of freshness!;"I've always heard about the very many benefits of Green Tea, but only got around to drinking it when I was down with the flu about 5 months ago and had a very sore throat. Unfortunately, the brand I picked up randomly <a href=""http://www."
6136;Apple Chips Rock!;I like this product a lot.  Good healthy snack when you don't have fresh fruit handy.
6137;House Blend is a perfect Blend!;I had received samples in the mail for Tully's coffee K-cups and as soon as I smelled the House Blend brewing, I knew it would be special.  No doubt.
6138;Please read the directions!;"Straight from the company: ""The Puppy Starter Kit(tm) includes a soft plastic Puppy Bone® for teething puppies BEFORE they get any permanent teeth(brown gel), a Dura Chew® chicken-flavored bone for powerful puppy chewers and puppies starting to get their permanent teeth (white), and a Healthy Edibles® bacon-flavored bone that is completely edible and recommended for puppies 6 MONTHS AND OLDER(light edible brown)"". Please supervise your pups with any and all toys."
6139;One of the best K-cups!;My family likes the Keurig coffee system very much.  This one of our most favorite flavored coffees.
6140;Wonderful smell;I love this stuff! It has a light delicate flavor and makes a wonderful skin oil. I get a lot of compliments on how I smell when I use this as a moisturizer.
6141;This is a first for me;Wow, I've never not liked one of the coffees or teas that are made for the Keuring..
6142;Great, but ...;I really like this trail mix. It has plenty of yummy healthy goodness.
6143;Great item, disappointing price & shipping service from Amazon;Love these treats for my puppy and my veterinarian was pleased with this product since the pup is slightly overweight and made in the USA, unfortunately they are quite pricey.  But when I started on the automatic monthly shipments from Amazon at the reduced price, Amazon cancelled the automatic shipments before the first shipment, for whatever reason, so now I have to buy them at the full higher price.
6144;Crispy, Crunchy Snack!;Snapea crisps are a fun and delicious snack for me. My only complaint is that they are not exactly gluten free,<br />there is a chance that there could be cross contamination.
6145;My bassett hound LOVES his food now...;Canidae has definetly proven to be a tasty, balanced source of food for my dog.<br /><br />Initially i had started my new pup on IAMS because of its popularity - but after reading the ingredient list and hearing the the IAMS corporation had just been sold (therefore not keeping the quality of their product) I decided I needed to provide my hound with a heathier source of nutrition.
6146;Great Cincy Chili Knock-off;"Alright, for those who are not in the know, Cincinnati style chili has almost nothing to do with the firey bowl of red that most people think of when they think ""chili.""  In some ways this style of chili has more in common with a stew called ""burgoo"" then with Southwestern Chili."
6147;Red licorice that actually has some taste.;I like to have licorice twists sitting around for an occasional snack. I tend to prefer red.
6148;overpriced and melted;These are super delicious, and I really like the attempt to be more wholesome.  But kind of a rip-off, and mine all came melted and reformed into a giant ball!!  Gross.
6149;disappointing batch;I'd ordered this taffy once before and I'd loved it: candy with a tangy molasses flavor seems to be increasingly harder to find, and this was especially good. Therefore I was terribly disappointed when the next shipment tasted only very faintly of molasses, as if they'd drastically reduced the amount of that ingredient.
6150;Loves convenience in GA;These pods have got to be the best invention yet. They are compact, extremely easy to use & is the best solution to making several very quick cups of coffee.
6151;THEE ONE AND ONLY BEST EVER NATURAL DOG COOKIE!;My sweet baby dog is a newly diagnosed diabetic and has to have a no sugar added, low fat diet. He was devastated to not have his regular dog treats, bones, etc that he looks for forward to.
6152;Mellow and a fantastic price as well;I'm no coffee expert, but I do like to have two cups a day and enjoy it. I don't like bitter coffee at all.
6153;Meth;I used this to make rocky candy as meth for a costume prop. I dressed as Hiesenburg from Breaking Bad.
6154;Flavor has changed...it is now terrible!!;I have been drinking this flavored coffee for over a year. Up until now I have loved it.
6155;Way over priced;Tiny boxes of rice milk averaging $1.00 a box.
6156;excellent flavor;This is a great coffee with excellent flavor.  You can add an extra pod for a darker, more robust coffee.
6157;BEST SEASONING SALT EVER;Great to use as a dry rub on tri-tip steak. Wonderful to sprinkle on steak, chicken, pork chops, potatoes, eggs and just about anything you can think of.
6158;Not Amazon's Fault But;It's not Amazon's fault by any means but I assumed (mea culpa) this gum was sugarless and it isn't.  For that reason and that reason only, I would not purchase this item a second time.
6159;Yummy Paneer;I ran into these on the east coast and loved them. They are made in India and have more heat than other versions, but that is good.
6160;AMAZING!;Finally a good strong cup of coffee.  After drinking weak, flavorless K-cups I found this one.
6161;Nice for an occassional treat;This is my first time trying any of the National Foods coffees. First of all, be careful when you open the package.
6162;Absolutely delicious;I absolutely love this salad dressing. I finished my last bottle months ago and haven't been able to find it in any of the grocery stores near me.
6163;Broken cookies.;We buy this type of product because of a health condition. We ordered these cookies fully expecting them to arrive in a some what good condition.
6164;Very impressed and I don't get impressed easily;Im not someone who usually writes reviews on products but I have made an exception. This product really works.
6165;The only thing all my cats will eat!;I have three very different cats, with very different tastes. The Science Diet adult hairball formula is one all three will eat without a fuss.
6166;The Dog just EATS IT UP!!;I usually mix a little of this with my dog's hard food. I noticed I can put a spoonful on her hard food and she eats it up just the same.
6167;EXCELLENT PRODUCT;EXCELLENT PRODUCT, SWEET TASTY AND THE KIDS LOVE THEM..
6168;You don't need to got to Italy to have a great espresso;Great espresso coffee. I own Breville espresso coffee machine and this coffee is perfect.
6169;Not Convinced it is Grape Seed Oil;"I bought a gallon of this and when it came it was not green like grape seed oil but a nearly-clear yellow.  I pan fried some eggs with a touch of this oil and instead of the neutral flavor of grape seed oil which doesn't change the flavor of the eggs,  I could taste this oil and it tasted a bit fishy like Canoloa oil or some ""off"" vegetable oil."
6170;Better Than Senseo Pods!;The trick is to know ahead of time: These are full pods, equivalent to using two Senseo pods so: Just use the double-pod holder to begin with.<br /><br />These pods produce a very rich, delicious brew with a satisfying foam.
6171;great tasting;All of these fruit snacks are large and tasty. Muscat was a little gross, but all in all, a great product.
6172;Weigela's Ghost;This plant came fast and was relatively tall (2-1/2 feet) with some red flowers on it already.  I found a good space and planted it immediately and it has already re-bloomed.
6173;Very nice;This was a present to someone who loves Green. They enjoyed it very much.
6174;Fever Tree Bitter lemon mixer/beverage;Delivery from this company was very timely. The product used as a mixer is very good.
6175;Great lunch/snack!;Another good one from Maruchan!  These things are easy as heck to prepare, just microwave a cup of water to boiling and pour.  Five minutes later, you have a quickie lunch.
6176;A+++ ITEM!;I bought this exact item locally at Le Gourmet Chef. I love this gadget! No more flat wine.
6177;Great-tasting iced coffee drink;At first blush, the illy issimo Cappuccino Coffee Drink reminds me of those refrigerated Starbucks Frappuccino bottled drinks you can pick up at a convenience store. However, the illy issimo has a much more defined coffee flavor.
6178;Good chips, terrible packaging;"Chips are good, but Amazon ships them in their original ""ready to ship"" box, which turns out is not really so ready for shipping. The box arrived in tatters"
6179;My Favorite Zevia -- Has Caffeine Though;This is the fourth Zevia flavor I've tried.  Orange was first, which I didn't like much.
6180;Very sour :(;My 2 year old daughter loves these sort of squeeze pouches so I ordered a whole case of these thinking that I could sneak some veggies in. Unfortunately this is not the case.
6181;Great tasting drink.;I enjoy this drink every morning before going to work. And my little child loves it so much.
6182;Very useful;This tea is very useful for me. It helps my digestion process be regular.
6183;Great overall;I ordered twice from this seller
6184;Amazon won't live up to their end;The product description says 12 packs of 12 (144 count), but when you order, you only get a box of twelve.  I did this weeks ago, talked to Amazon, but they still haven't updated the product description.
6185;HEAVEN S SENT;WE HAVE 5 DOGS.  THREE ARE SPECIAL NEEDS DOGS WE ADOPTED.
6186;Fast service...;Awesome service..
6187;Comparing Tully's and Green Mountain French Roast;"In order to figure out which brand I should buy in the future I compared Tully's French Roast and Green Mountain French Roast k-cups side-by-side.  Results: Tully's has a more full bodied flavor, whereas Green Mountain has a thinner flavor (I can almost describe it as ""more watery"" but that wouldn't be the right word, but it is missing something)."
6188;Great for dog food additive!;I have never eaten dried eggs, so I can't comment on the taste or quality for human diets.  I bought this product to add to my dog's food because I have a couple of picky eaters, especially one older girl who doesn't have much of an appetite sometimes.
6189;Great Thinking Toy;My Lab Mix loves this toy.  When he was a pup he had a hard time figuring it out and would get frustrated and just bark at it.
6190;Oh my yum...;These are simply divine.  Rich, dark, delicious, pretty much all around perfect.
6191;DELICIOUS CHOCOLATE;I do not like all chocolates and when ever i put a piece of kinder bueno into my mouth, i fell in love..
6192;Berritious!;My kid loves this one. He generally eats most of the veggie and fruit packages, but this one serves as a desert.
6193;Effective product....;I am an activer person. That means I wash my hair (at least) once every day.
6194;Not great, but I'll work with it.;I'm hoping this tastes better over time. There is definitely a metallic aftertaste.
6195;My Absolute Favorite Flavor;This is absolutely my favorite flavor of KIND bars.  I am allergic to wheat, and I love that all of the KIND bars are wheat free.
6196;5 seconds flat;I sat the toy on the floor and he immediately opened one flap and used it to rotate the toy and get the treats in every chamber. It wasn't much of a puzzle and he finished before I could log in to write this review.
6197;Hondo;My wife said the coffee was excellent and that she will definitely purchase it again.  The price was very attractive as well.
6198;Tastes like Yellow Cake Batter;This is the best tasting Protein Shake I have ever tried, and it's pretty lean at only 6.5 Calories per gram of protein.
6199;Best instant coffee you will ever taste;Even though this is actually instant espresso, it is the best instant coffee you will ever taste hands down.  Medaglia d'Oro is also excellent but more expensive since it is only offered in small jars.
6200;Great Bold Coffee!!;"<a href=""http://www.amazon."
6201;nothing special;The first one you eat tastes pretty good. But I got tired of them pretty quickly.
6202;Smokehouse pig ears with no smoke...;"<a href=""http://www.amazon."
6203;How much caffeine?;Buyer beware.  Notice how carefully worded the descriptions are to avoid stating the caffeine content.
6204;Gluten free - Munch worthy & Crunchy with a hint of sweetness & salt..Popchips Sweet Potato;I'm all for healthier, crunchy snacks. Popchips works for me in this category.
6205;Nettle Leaf Tea;If I can't find this at my local market or in a near by store, I order it from Amazon. I drink this tea after a night of drinking alcohol in order to help cleanse my liver.
6206;Mild and Pleasant.;A very mild, but pleasant blend. Not as strong as I normally prefer, but the taste is so good I drink it anyhow.
6207;Great;My dog and I both love this product.  My vet even said it was great that my dog is having one every day.
6208;Require intent supervision...;I loved these chews until today..
6209;Bland taste, little bacon flavor;when you open the package, it smells like bacon.  After poping, the smell is a heavy burnt bacon smell.
6210;best energy drink. bad price;I love Monster energy drink, but the $47.89 price for a case is not a good deal.
6211;Keeps Fido occupied;This is great to use to keep your dog busy for a while. My terrier loves it.
6212;Causes Vomiting!!!!;Both of my cats vomit from all Temptations treats, but especially the Hairball variety. One of my cats actually is getting hairballs from these treats when he didn't before.
6213;Love them;I grew up with Haribo candy and this was my favorite. I'm please to say that the quality is still the same.
6214;A Horse Is a Horse Is a Snack, Of Course;My dog is constantly out to get me. Keeping little miss 'Princess Paws' from rooting through the trash, diddling the carpets or wrecking the house is like trying to keep Lindsey Lohan out of dive bars, crack dens and paparazzi mug shots.
6215;Makes Pill Time Treat Time;Our dog has been undergoing treatment for an auto-immune disease for about 6 months now. He went from taking 0 pills to taking up to 8 pills twice a day (now down to 3.
6216;GREAT taste~!;I love these because they are the best tasting protein bars I've ever had, while still having zero sugar and the same amount of protein than other bars. These taste just like a real candy bar, with none of the nasty after taste that other bars with artificial sweeteners have.
6217;Love these!;My beagle has a very sensitive stomach but loves to chew. Gave her one of these thinking it would be like a greenie and last only a few minutes because she can really do some damage when she chews.
6218;Bags on board;The bags are great- easy to use and biodegradable, which is awesome. They're long enough to easily tie when you've finished, and they're pretty! I just wish there were more bags in a roll.
6219;pretty good;Starbucks vanilla is good, but definitely does not have as much vanilla taste as we would like.  Probably will not buy again.
6220;Bakery On Main;This is such an excellent product
6221;Great Treats;I have a standard poodle that is 11 months old. The breeder recommended the Mother Nature Treats.
6222;Too Sweet, Too Small, & Too Expensiv e;"The logo says ""100% of what you want.  0% of what you don't want""."
6223;"This stuff is the ""put on everything"" sauce";So I have sampled and bought my fair share of Everidae sauce and I have to say without a doubt it is the next best thing to put on food.  I will start off by saying I do know the maker of this sauce, and although that may seem like this review is a bit biased, i wanted to be the first to formally state the flavorful blend of this sauce can literally go on everything.
6224;Great;I have never tried Muscovado sugar, and I can say it is delicious. Less processing = more natural nutrition that is essentially non existent in typical brown sugar.
6225;Delicious treat!!!;These things arrived for me and my counterparts out here in afghanistan. The vendor was prompt and it was exactly what we wanted.
6226;Klein's Natural Brazil Nuts;Some of the containers in the shippment had opened duringshippment. Amazon offered a replacement or credit for the unusable Brazil nuts.
6227;Over-enthusastic Reviews Strike Again;If there is a great sale on an Amazon product and I have amazon gift certificates, invariably I will make a purchase if the reviews are up in the sky.  And just as often, when the product arrives, it does so fresh from it's crash back to earth.
6228;Tastes great hot or cold;I don't care for licorice, but this stuff rocks!  It's a naturally sweet desert tea that tastes great cold too. This is my substitute for soda and helps when you are having a sweet tooth and don't want to eat junk food.
6229;New Grains Raisin Bread;New Grains is a new manufacturer for me -- just diagnosed about 5 months ago, I ended up with those familiar brands that could be found at the stores.  I took a chance with them and I was very pleased.
6230;Chips are stale;I just received these as a re-order.  Although good in the past, this time they taste stale and not very crunchy.
6231;My dog Sashie loves this supplement w/ her dry food!;I have to say its a bit pricey but at the end I actually saved alot because you only need to give a couple of spoonful along with the dry food. My dog loves it! You have to make sure you give a small amount depending on the size of your pet because it's high in calories.
6232;fabulous!;Be careful - these cookies are addicting.  Everyone I've given them to has loved them.
6233;Udi's is the Best!!!;We have become addicted to Udi's.  My husband and I look forward to our bowl of Udi's as much as we look forward to our cup of coffee in the morning.
6234;It's not fried!;I am on a restricted diet, so these popchips was something I was eager to try.  I am always on the lookout for healthy alternatives to snacking - these were neither fried nor baked (although I will gladly eat a baked chip over a fried potato chip) - popped chips.
6235;Succulent and juicy!;Big Franks are the best vegetarian frank that I have ever tried. They taste far better than real meat weiners.
6236;Starbucks cinnamon coffee;We're very disappointed. We love flavored coffee but when we tasted Starbucks Natural Fusions Ground Coffee, Cinnamon Flavored - it was terrible! It tasted like we were licking an ashtray.
6237;Dog Loves Them;"Have used the CET Chews for years. Our little dog loves them !!!!! She barks like crazy at the cupboard we keep them in every night after dinner, that is when she gets her ""bonie"" :-)  We brush her teeth everyday but these are a great addition to brushing."
6238;Delicious toaster pastries...;All of the Nature's Path organic toaster pastries are delicious, and actually good for you, to the extent that a carb filled toaster pastry can be. The frosting amount is just right, not too little, and not too overpowering.
6239;Wonderful - and chocolaty if you eat them right!;I love these because they're not coated with sugar and dairy - just plain old dark cocoa powder.  They will taste a lot like chocolate if you eat them right - put them in your mouth, let the chocolate mix with your mouth juices, then start eating the almond.
6240;Very good!;I bought these not realizing that they were not the regular CLIF bars..
6241;My dog actually eats these treats!;My dog cannot be bribed.  I have tried EVERYTHING.
6242;Good and Good!;"Good, though not my fav.  I will keep it in my stash for my cup of jo padres, however, I love the ""donut people"" coffee the best!  Keurig is the bombdiggity."
6243;TOO SAD FOR WORDS;The box was packaged nicely, not mixed up like other people have commented, and I was really excited for this. I watched the package's tracking info like a hawk.
6244;Hotter than Hell!;They weren't kidding. This stuff burns a hole through you.
6245;Not great but can be made so...;Came out very flat and eggy which I cannot stand.  So I played and discovered if you add to the recipe one of the dixie bakesquick inner packets and a tsp vanilla to the mix (no additional fluid) you get real pancakes that are nice and fluffy and taste whole grain.
6246;false advertising;i purchase this item but it does not fit to 80gb. video ipod.
6247;DOOMHAMMER approved;I love this brand. If you go to their website, sign up for their newsletters.
6248;Good Jerky;I like to have some jerky for a midmorning bite while at work.  Good deal and good tasting.
6249;First Baby Food Used;This was the packaged baby food I gave to my son, and it is his favorite.  It may be a little tart, but it is cute to see his reaction each time I put a spoonful in his mouth.
6250;Tapioca Flour Power;It works so well.  Helps get through the maze of figuring out new baking recipes.
6251;yum;These granola are crunchy and cocoa flavored, good for a sweet treat midmorning which can help you last through lunch. At 130 calories they're a better option than vending machine fare.
6252;The best snack blend ever!;These are so good. I bought some in a store to try and then loved them so much I bought a case online.
6253;A truly delicious maple syrup at a good price;My first bottle did actually suffer a little damage in shipment, but I can't blame the product for the sins of UPS.  The actual maple syrup here is beautiful dark amber, rich with mapley goodness.
6254;great!;this pen works better than any pen i have worked with before. You may have to trace over a few things twice, but not very often.
6255;Doggies Addicted!;I have two Peek-a-Poo's and just say Greenies and they go crazy.  These are the reformulated Greenies are made with gelatin compared to the old ones that had harmed some dogs and were pulled from market.
6256;Incredible;I don't need to say much.<br /><br />INCREDIBLE!<br />I absolutely love all the flavors, but this flavor and the regular white chocolate are the best.
6257;great tea;"I received this tea as a birthday gift.  I generally don't like teas with ""odd"" flavors-- I don't like stuff like cinnamon, lemon, rose hips, or orange rind in my tea."
6258;Better than everyday coffee;I thought this coffee was very good, but I drink lattes and tea more than regular coffee, so I don't necessarily trust my judgment.  As a result, I shared it with a coffee-loving colleague at work.
6259;Not as good as everyone claims.;I read all the reviews before giving in and buying. After all the comments on how good this tasted I really expected to like it.
6260;Easy to prepare and makes a tasty meal;I have made beef rendang from scratch in the past, but very rarely-I don't have the 6+ hours it takes to make the dish.  That said, this is an adequate substitute for a quicker version.
6261;Better Than Any Other Joint Helper Chewables for Dogs! And I did pretty much try them all...;My parents Brittany Spaniel was on these the last few years of her life. She lived to be 19, and was walking around much better on these than she had been on the previous pills.
6262;BEST ever!;This is the first time I've gotten a case of artichoke product without one single 'rust' spot on the can! Did Reese update the factory? Lovers of Reese products are probably familiar with the occasional spotted can (does not affect quality of product, but creepy nonetheless)but these were pristine! Not to mention the perfect size to top a salad or pizza without cutting up. Drain and serve these petite morsels, no muss no fuss.
6263;Not quite as described.;First, as others have noted, the picture doesn't quite match the product.  As of 10/24/12, what you will get is a mix of cherry, watermelon, and grape taffy.
6264;Tasty!!;Fantastic, everyone loves it. I would buy this again.
6265;Not for us;I bought the 24 piece variety pack and each of my four kids did not finish their rope. We eat a lot of organics but they each turned up their noses at these.
6266;Amazon;I have been taking this product for several years now and receive good results.  I find it helps to keep me regular.
6267;Not What I Expected....;The product I received in the mail was not what I expected. First, the packaging was of very poor quality.
6268;Good wholesome food;Ignore the cat vote - this is food for dogs and it is really good. Dogs love it and it is all meat - can't go wrong.
6269;Great Stuff - My Kitty Loves it!;My cats love this stuff!  This size 1 1/3 is perfect for a small house-hold of cats (one to three).<br /><br />They just go over to the container and start playing with it - to let me know they want to have some cat nip.
6270;Great Strong Coffee;These pods do not contain a weak blend of coffee, but will make a good strong cup of coffee instantly, in the Bunn Coffee Maker.<br />I recommend these pods, as they are the best you can buy.
6271;Cloyingly sweet;Bought for gin & tonics. Was really excited that it used cane sugar, came in a can, and came in an 8oz size.
6272;Great Value;These were a fantastic value when I purchased them! They were un-opened, fresh, & tasted delicious (of course - lol). They arrived quickly and were a great on the go breakfast or anytime snack.
6273;Too much of a licorice smell and taste;Well, I understand that since it is Licorice Spice tea it would have some licorice smell and taste, but it is just too much for me. If you use 1 bag of it in your cup you are getting light yellow liquid with a very strong licorice taste and smell.
6274;Surprisingly Effective;Our garden in the backyard had been getting ravaged by some small little rodents. We have gophers, rabbits and chipmunks that are seen almost daily around or IN our garden.
6275;So relaxing;I am a huge lavender fan, but have never tried any edible/drinkable lavender products, only those that smell good. I was a little concerned this would taste funny, because even though I know smell and taste are tightly linked, lavender seems like the kind of thing that would smell way better than it tastes.
6276;The Perfect Snack;These bars are delicious and easy to grab when time is a factor.  I especially like the amount of protein available.
6277;tastes great & great price!;"I really like the mudslide coffee (and Gloria Jean's toffee coffee).  It has a ""chocolate-y"" taste to it that isn't too strong or too weak."
6278;Perfect for Training;I like these treats for training my dog. When I am working with her on a particular task, I like that they are small so I can give her more.
6279;I would buy it again...;I like the quality and price of this produce and will buy it again when this order runs out.  I would recommend it to anyone looking for quantity AND quality.
6280;Addicting but don't eat too many;These are delicious.  They don't taste sugar-free at all.
6281;Delicious!;My niece and her 8 y/o and 3 y/o visited my 9 and 10 y/o, from the east coast. We were at Starbuck's getting coffee.
6282;Very pretty.;What is so great about these teas is the novelty. They are beautiful to watch flower, which has a very calming effect, which is something I enjoy about tea in general.
6283;Awesome Blueberry Unfrosted Pop-Tarts;These blueberry unfrosted Pop-Tarts are just awesome.  I don't like the frosted ones anymore and also most of the other flavors are fakey tasting and just plain awful.
6284;MY PUG WONT EAT ANYTHING ELSE;My 9 1/2 year old pug seems to have developed a senesitive stomach as he got older and lost some teeth..
6285;Great coffee, excellent price;I've been drinking the Tully's House Blend K-Cup coffee for a few years now. I occasionally buy a different variety just to try it out, but always find myself wanting the Tully's more.
6286;Special Sea Salt;A friend brought me a small container of this salt when she returned from a trip to Majorca.  When the container was empty, everyone in the family wanted more.
6287;Pumpernickle pretzels;Excellent pretzel!  Can't find locally so I order in bulk - and they don't last long.  My daughter even asked for a box (12 bags) for her birthday.
6288;Stong peppermint, but weak mocha;COST: At the time of this writing this runs about $0.44 per 8oz cup.
6289;Do I Need to Explain...;..
6290;molassas lovers rejoice;V E R Y impressed with this product.  I have experienced Muscavo suger from South America and wanted to try sugars from other regions.
6291;As Advertised;I've tried almost every energy drink out there and some work and some don't, but for the most part they all crash an hour or so later and leave you scrambling for some food or more energy drinks.  A never ending, ugly cycle.
6292;Pass on This for Davidson's organic chamomile;I love tea and herbal tea. I have ordered Davidson's 1-pound organic chamomile tea from Amazon numerous times now.
6293;Price is too high;When I originally purchased this product I only paid about $18.00 dollars for it and I thought that was what I would pay each time I received the product
6294;It's a Matter of Taste;OK, so some people like it, some people don't. I'm one of those who was excited about the prospect of getting iced tea from my Keurig, but was sorely disappointed by the taste from this tea.
6295;Best natural way to fight chest colds.;I happened to try this when our local Safeway used to carry it.  It opens up the lungs when you have a bad chest cold and relaxes you at the same time.
6296;Nutritious and Delicious;This cereal is very delicious.  I love it because it has 3g protein and 3g fiber and amaranth,quinoa, and corn flour.
6297;Nutritional facts are inaccurate;I've been eating these as part of a low carb diet, and thinking they are too good to be true because they are so good. Estimating the amount, I plugged the ingredients into an online recipe nutrition calculator and I could not come close to the amount of net carbs or calories that are on the label.
6298;Will Now Only Use Coconut Oil For The Rest of My Life!;I had high expectations when ordering Nutiva Coconut Oil because I had recently discovered that America has been lied to about unsaturated fats and saturated fats for years, and that if I want to lose weight, then I should stick to what my taste buds naturally love- Saturated fat!<br />Nutiva Coconut Oil has gone above and beyond meeting my expectations. I am blown away!<br />It satisfied what I expected:<br />1.
6299;Orgain Iced Cafe Mocha;I suffer from Celiac Disease, a severe intolerance to gluten. I was thrilled to find Orgain after my diagnosis.
6300;DELICIOUS!!!!!;I used to be able to get these at my supermarket and would buy a number of them during the Christmas<br />holiday.  Since I couldn't get them at the market anymore, I decided to check Amazon.
6301;Our twins love this one. With the subscription, the price is fair;Both our twins love this one right from the start but it's not loaded with lentils (see ingredients below).  We introduced it when they were 7 months old and now they're 10 months.
6302;Classic southern BBQ sauce==delicious on Pork;A tangy mustard vinegar sauce without being bitter or sweet.<br /><br />Nice change of pace from tomato or pepper sauces.
6303;Gets me through the day;A friend showed these to me because she knows I can get low blood sugar.  I was skeptical, but decided to buy a box.
6304;yummy!!!;I love the mango macadamia nut flavor. It's sweet with a little crunch, plus vitamin D and calcium.
6305;Best cookie bar ever;I crave these day and night. Best cookie/brownie bar I have ever tasted- not too headache-y sweet, but a rich cocoa flavor with a really great texture.
6306;Versatile product;Pamela's Ultimate Baking and Pancake Mix is an extremely versatile product. It makes wonderful Belgian waffles that even non-celiac friends & family enjoy.
6307;Wonderful snacks;Great product for an afternoon snack,with crackers or in a sandwich.Just enough for two to share so as not to have too much.
6308;cookie thins;I really like that this product does not have any crazy ingredients or anything artificial or corn syrup, things like that, you know. It is just literally - flour, oil, sugar, fruit, and mysterious natural favor.
6309;Multi Cat Family - All Of Them Love Newman's Own Pet Food;We switched to Newman's Own dry and wet food several years ago. We have noticed a huge difference in our pets.
6310;Dogs love it;I always buy these on line for the dogs because the pet stores and grocery store prices are four times more.  For my small 10 pound dogs, I should have bought the teenie vice petite size though.
6311;Best Tasting!!!;Hands down, best sardines ever! Not fishy in the least, in fact, tuna is fishier than these. they sold out at one store i went to and my husband, poor guy, picked up another brand so i could have some anyhow, and i couldn't even finish the other brand.
6312;Amazing taste;The taste is amazing. I can no longer find in stores, it seems maybe discontinued which is a shame but thankfully still sold here.
6313;Do it now....! You'll never go back!!!;I bought whole wheat berries for health reasons..
6314;I love this tea!;I drink this tea all the time.  We brew up a couple pitcher fulls of iced tea per day.
6315;Love 'em!;These are the best chips EVER!  Fantastic potato flavor and crunch.  I don't even want regular chips again.
6316;Senseo coffee;Coffee is very good, the order arrived timely and in great condition.  It's very easy to order and cheaper than buying in the supermarket.
6317;Great alternative to canned or cooking your own;When I can, I love to make fresh pintos with tomato and roasted garlic. During the summer I am so busy I'll often put pintos out to soak and throw them away 2 days later.
6318;Not the same teas as promised;Only 2 of the 4 teas listed here are what was shipped to me. The other two were random teas not listed anywhere in the description.
6319;GREAT coffee, misleading price;One of our faves, very smooth and easy on the acidity without being bland, HOWEVER, the Tassimo retail is 7.99 each.
6320;Organic Yumminess!;Our son LOVES this applesauce. We try to feed him all organic foods and this was the only applesauce we could find in individual cups that was organic.
6321;Nature's Bakery Whole Wheat Fig Bars;These are the best fig bars I have ever tasted. I enjoy eating them.
6322;Great product, even better customer service!;I did think this was a little pricey for a dog toy that might be destroyed within minutes, but I took a chance anyway.  I am glad I did.
6323;Great!;The Pure Himalayan Salt is very good.  I typically do not use salt, but this salt has a very good taste that is so different than regular table salt.
6324;"Disappointed with the ""punch""";I bought the powdered wasabi (actually faux wasabi) because I was hoping to stop buying wasabi in the tube at $5+/tube.  But, the powdered wasabi was very disappointing.
6325;Quite good;I enjoy these chips. I got these instead of my usual jalapeno ones from the same company for a bit of flavor change.
6326;great product and cheep.;I have not had any acid reflux since I started taking Fenugreek. Herbal is the way to go if at all possible.
6327;Sweet Taste - Has Pulp;This is the third brand of coconut water I have tried. This one tastes much different than other brands, it has a definate SWEET taste and tastes like the coconut taste Americans are familiar with from various coconut desserts or drinks.
6328;I Love Gin Gins;I really like the flovor of the Gin Gins. I bought some at a discount store just to try, then ordered by bulk from Amazon.
6329;Great Iced Coffee Alternative;A great alternative to Iced Coffee, soda and energy drinks. This has plenty of caffeine in it to get you going in the morning and tastes great.
6330;LOVE IT;We just had our 2nd baby and decided to do as much Organic food as possible.  Since he's only 10 weeks old and we couldn't breastfeed this was a great option.
6331;Happy Doggy;My 12-year-old Husky goes crazy for these - they are healthy, delicious (apparently), and a great training tool.  They are a little pricey, but worth it for the joy in my dog's face.
6332;We use this for everything!;I buy this every two months. We have a family of 3 and use it for cooking, skincare, and my massage business.
6333;The best, even without a salad!;The wonton strips are great!!!! Mine dont even make it to the salad..
6334;Really good product;I am taste testing the Larabars, and the Cashew Cookie bars are wonderful - they have the consistency of the canned Halvah that you get in the gourmet stores, but has a cashewy taste.<br />Of all the flavors I have tried, the Pecan Pie, the Cinnamon Roll, and the Cashew are my favorites.
6335;disliked by my cats;wish i could say my 2 cats like this food but that is not the case.  1 cat won't even get close to it and the other cat eats alittle but not much---i even ran it thru the food processor to make it smoother but that did't help.
6336;Couldn't even finish my cup;I was very excited to try some tea with chocolate.  Maybe I don't like hazelnut, I can't really say, but I can say that I did not like this flavor-at all.
6337;Can't get enough;This Orange-Mango Ice is the most delicious carbonated beverage I've ever had. It's made with sucralose, which I trust to be safer than other artificial sweeteners.
6338;mozzarella;I enjoyed these Mozzarella Cheez-Its, but you can't beat the original. I have tried a number of the new flavored Cheez-Its, & there are some I like better than others.
6339;Jet Tea Smoothie Mix;Love this product!  I have been purchasing from the Jet line for several years now.  The mixes are so easy to use and prepare.
6340;excellent hibiscus tea;Absolutely the best.Great product and the packaging is very good also.
6341;Unbelievably good, worth the price;After developing a peanut allergy two years ago, I despaired of my ever eating anything as delicious ever again. I tried to substitute almond butter but failed--I bought a bottle of expensive crap that sat in the back of my fridge for a year before I tossed it.
6342;Love it;Love it. Almost as much as my K cup brewing unit.
6343;Different, but good.;Understand that its a diet drink before you buy. That said, it's very good.
6344;No Tricks All Treats;I must admit I'm in love with these delish strawberry granola bars. They are perfectly chewy and<br />taste like strawberry cake.
6345;Strong but not bitter;This is an afternoon pleaser.  I prefer brewing the larger sized cup.
6346;Pretty Near the Classic Version, and Better;These arrived in good condition.  They are extremely close to the old original version, and I think actually better.
6347;Good price, good taste;My mom and I have fallen in love with these chips, which we discovered while on a road trip. I now buy them in bulk, to arrive every other month.
6348;Delicious!;These baked chips have a great crunch. Best baked chips I've had to date.
6349;less cocoa taste than expected;Pleasant tasting but I thought it would be chocolatier from other reviews.I won't buy again.
6350;Woflgang Puck Favorite !!;Jamaica Me Crazy is an awesome smooth coffee, Light Coconut/Vanilla flavorful taste.<br />a good coffee if you don't like real strong coffee.
6351;Outstanding Cookies!!!!;"I have to say ""WOW!"" to Bob's Red Mill Gluten-Free Chocolate Chip Cookie Mix. My order just came in today and we couldn't wait to try them."
6352;Tasty & in a convenient squueze bottle;"After having some problems with Specturm's large glass jars not being sealed correctly, therefore getting some bad ones I was looking for another option. We do not eat alot of mayonnaise so decided to try their ""squeeze"" bottles."
6353;I love them!;I'm an adult and I love this product, so it's not just for kids. :)<br /><br />Great for satisfying a sweet craving while still being healthy and low-calorie.
6354;No thanks;I tried it when it arrived and did not like it. I tried to send the other unopened bags back but that request was was denied by Amazon.
6355;Fabulous!;These chips are some of the best I've tasted. They are not filled with chemicals.
6356;Best licorice around;My son loves this Aussie licorice and I couldn't find it anywhere EXCEPT on Amazon. It was shipped very promptly (in time for Xmas)and it disappeared all too quickly.
6357;Zatarain's White Bean Seasoning Mix  - the way to cook beans!;Zatarain's White Bean Seasoning Mix is an excellent addition to any home pantry!<br /><br />It makes cooking dry beans so easy and effortless. You don't have to think about what spices to add to help flavor the pot of beans sitting on the stove.
6358;My dog loves these healthy treats!;These treats are an excellent alternative to traditional fatty dog treats.  My dog, who is picky and will not even eat pig ears, loves them!  I highly recommend this product.
6359;Good flavor, nice price on a tasty herb.;These are not always easy to find in typical grocery stores especially outside the city.  Very good on a variety of foods and these are a great combination and the price I paid on Amazon for 3 bottles is about what 1 bottle would cost me at my local store.
6360;Awesome gluten-free pretzels;These pretzels are absolutely delicious!  In fact, EVERYTHING from Ener-G foods is usually great.  They're a little pricey, but so worth it if you have to avoid wheat and gluten.
6361;my dog's favorite;My dog loves these flossies and he is picky about treats and things to chew on.  My vet also said they are good for him to chew on because they help prevent plaque build up on his teeth.
6362;South Beach Snack Bar;These bars are so delicious.  They are light but at the same time satisfying.
6363;A great popcorn for small children!;This popcorn is much smaller than your average popcorn, and it is virtually hulless.  That is exactly what I was looking for in a popcorn because my 3 year old LOVES popcorn.
6364;THE BEST CANDEH EVAR.;Seriously--if you like the taste of honeydew melon, this is your G-dsend.  Its taste is NATURAL and it leaves an aftertaste in your mouth as if you've just eaten a whole, sweet, ripe honeydew melon.
6365;I Love it;I really do not like to review Coffee because it's a matter of personal taste. But I thought why not.
6366;Not for me;I must be a bit of a wuss, because this soup tastes to me how I imagine fire might taste. Typically I like spicy food if it has a good flavor.
6367;Arrived slightly damaged but still works;I received this product promptly but when it arrived the cap had been slightly damaged.  It looked like something very heavy had been put on top of it and crushed it a bit.
6368;My Doggy Gave this 2 Paws Down...;Wayyyyyyyy down.  I received a box of the small biscuits for my 15 lb, West Highland Terrier, and mind you, she's a little piggy.
6369;Nice taste!  Fruity but not overly so, light and refreshing;This is a high-quality Olive Oil, no doubt about it.  I leave it to the experts to debate its acidity, virginity, etc.
6370;Texas Toothpicks are wonderful;I have a couple of very spoiled dogs and they are picky about what they eat.  I ran across a package of the Texas Toothpicks and decided to give them a try.
6371;Move Over Ban Roll On Deoderant:  lol  Here is Lickety Stik!;OK, so my dog loves this and she is a picky eater.  I literally had to force her mouth open and give a roll of it on her tongue and she has been hooked ever since.
6372;Yummy, yummy, yummy!;This is so incredibly healthy and delicious. I mainly follow macrobiotics, which is how I found out this product exists in the first place, and this is just a great, different whole grain.
6373;dog loves them;My dog loves the taste of these..
6374;Missed the Mark;This Taco Bell sauce misses the mark. I gave a very positive review for the other two flavors of Taco Bell sauce, but this one is no good.
6375;Great Rub That Goes With Everything;Willingham's Original Rub is an award winner for a reason.  It's delicious and really takes your meat to the next level.
6376;Best of the Best;"I absolutely LOVE this flavor!! It is so nice to be able to drink a ""diet soda"" and not get a migraine afterwards. It is all natural and there is little to no aftertaste."
6377;HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT;I was so excited to find these peanut butter cups at our local market. I love peanut butter cups.
6378;k-cup pods;Based on previous reviews, I tried the San Francisco bay coffee and they are excellent.  Love the plastic free pods.
6379;Fully enjoyed;I liked most all of these except for the cheddar ones.  These are packed with flavor and are a great alternative to regular potato chips as well as being just 80% just as good.
6380;Excellent coffee.;Excellent coffee.  Quick receipt of same.
6381;I LOVE THIS SO MUCH!!!!;It's AMAZING. Seriously.
6382;Not a sugar substitue for cooking sugar.;I will try another zylitol next. This did not work in cooking and did not dissolve quick enough.
6383;Wow this stuff is good.;Never having tried this before getting it on Amazon, I must say this is REALLY good cereal.  As a note to other perspective buyers, you'll notice most one star reviews are not in regards to flavor, but in exp.
6384;excellent product;The Celestisl Sleepytime Tea is wonderful.  It's a nice warm drink (non-caffeinated)  before bedtime.
6385;Yummy treats;Both of my dogs love these treats.  I am so glad I can give them something good for them that they beg to have!  And no worries about what might have been put in them from another country.
6386;fun way to decorate cake pops;These food-safe markers work well on cake pops dipped in candy melts. They do not clog, and retain their tips well when care is used during application.
6387;Way too sour!;Given the great reviews for these, I took the chance and ordered some.  I love sour fruit snacks and so do my three kids so I was excited to get these.
6388;Dogs are happy, therefore I am happy :);We own two dogs who are drastically different in sizes. I've always preferred the slivers because my smaller dog can manage them better, and I pick out the larger pieces for my bigger dog.
6389;Very Good - and very spicy!;While I am not Indian, I do cook Indian food from scratch quite often.  I have taken lessons on and off for the past three years, and have gotten tips, recipes, and compliments from my Indian co-workers.
6390;BEST LITTER EVER!;I am sooo happy that I found an affordable way to get this litter!  We used this litter for 2 years before moving from NY to KY.  When we got here a few months ago we found out that there were no vendors for this litter within a few 100 miles, so we switched to fresh step crystals .
6391;Definitely a healthy cereal!;If you are looking for a cereal that is good for you
6392;Escal Escargot AAAA+++++;Excellent product.  I came across a recipe for escargot in mushroom caps and was looking for large escargot.
6393;Excellent Hot Chocholate;Was skeptical about the quality of hot chocolate from a K cup but Grove Square is amazing.  It is just as good as making it from scratch but without the fuss.
6394;Verona is my favorite;I have tried Verona, Africa Kitamu and Columbian and will continue to purchase Verona..
6395;The perfect Amaretti cookies;These Amaretti are the perfect balance of crunchy and chewy, sweet and bitter.  If you are using Amaretti in a recipe, then any brand would be fine, but if you are serving them plain, spring for the Lazzaroni because they have the best taste and texture.
6396;Good and Tasty Candy;These Pomegranate licorice twists are excellent.  They have a nice light flavor and a good chewy texture for those who like this type of candy.
6397;worst pizza crust ever;The sauce was good. The pizza crust was absolutely horrible.
6398;good bread mix;My family is gluten intolerant so we searched for a suitable replacement.  Pamela's Products makes a good bread mix.
6399;"Great toy, skip the ""everlasting"" treat part";We picked up one of these on spec from the local pet store and ended up ordering another from Amazon because our older dog loved it so much he wouldn't share. We've put dry treats and some fresh cooked meat in the center area and it's led to 60 minute-plus play sessions for our dogs.
6400;Would be a nice gift;The packaging, the box as well as the individual pods, is attractive to the point where it would make a great gift for any coffee drinker and especially a coffee drinking Bob Marley fan.  I liked the coffee, it smelled and tasted very good and the individually sealed pods assure long term freshness.
6401;Great for Lego Party;I ordered these Lego-like candy from Amazon.com for my son's 9th Lego birthday party.
6402;Flavor ok lots of husks;The flavor is good and it is not so heavy with the fake and  greasy butter sludge. It does have a huge amount of un-popped husks.
6403;Love the taste but...;I bought this for the low sugar content and reviews that talk about good taste. I understood it has some saturated fat (palm oil) and no trans fat, ok with me.
6404;LOVE LOVE LOVE;I am actually allergic to flake coconut..
6405;Really good coffee;So far, this is my favorite blend of coffee. It has a delicious flavor.
6406;Absolutely the BEST!!!;I bought this hot chocolate at a grocery store because it looked interesting.  We like to drive around our neighborhood and look at the Christmas lights.
6407;Old product;The first bag was dated 2012 but the product inside was dated 2007 and was discolored and stale. The second bag was dated 2012 and the product inside was dated 2011 and was very good.
6408;A tasty snack for the health conscious;I am a label reader - I count fat grams, carbs, proteins and grams of fiber vs. grams of sugar.
6409;Fresh & Tasty;Too good to last. Next thing I know it's all gone.
6410;LOVE IT!!!;I love these cookies so much, and I've never been a fan of lemon cake or pastries. They are so soft and I think I may be addicted now! All 3 of my kids love them, as well as the NO GLUTEN GINGER ones.
6411;great price for a nylabone;nice big solid nylabone. Great for large dogs.
6412;Yuck...;I felt like I was drinking pure sugar.<br /><br />Which, it would seem, is exactly what I am drinking.
6413;Quite simply delicious;My favorite way to prepare this is to mix roughly equal amounts of the cocoa and agave syrup, adding just a few drops of hot water to make it the consistency I want. Sometimes I sprinkle it with a dusting of organic instant coffee.
6414;AMAZINGLY FLAVORFULL;This tea is exhilirating. I just love it.
6415;Earthy flavor may not be for everyone.;These have an earthy, dry flavor that may not be for everyone.  My wife has gluten, wheat, egg and dairy allergies so I got her these as a healthy snack.
6416;Amazon, you Amazon;Product, price & service,what more can you say. This product is available in some stores and those that do have it price it above what would be a fair price.
6417;Unbelievably Delicious;Truly delicious.  The flavor is incredible and better than any other hot chocolate I have tried.
6418;Good...not Great...;These are pretty good..
6419;My Take;While this is a lovely thoughtful gift, don't expect the handcrafted mahogany bamboo chest to be anything you want to display, or keep.  It just wouldn't hold up.
6420;Why eat out ?!?  This stuff is GREAT !!;I spent a year living in New Delhi, and developed quite a fondness for Indian food.  This is as close as I have *ever* come to recreating the restaurant fare at home.
6421;A nice step up from plain rice cereal;Our nine-month-old daughter is ready for a more substantial breakfast than plain cereals.  We want her to get the nutrients and vitamins she needs (especially iron), so plain fruit or vegetables aren't enough.
6422;hits the spot;My wife bought this by accident and now it's my coffee of choice.  I run it through a french press (it's a fine ground, but I like my coffee thick anyhow).
6423;Amazing;These are sooooo delicious. They taste just like regular chocolate bars, which I can't have on my low-carb diet.
6424;Perfect Low Sodium Bouillon;Hard to find in the stores, but always available on Amazon. Great item.
6425;Best chocolate and it is healing!;I am eating this chocolate as part of trauma therapy -- large bars come with visualization exercises. It is so delicious! I love the idea of using chocolate to reduce anxiety and be more present.
6426;Noticably great conditioner!;I normally wouldn't rant about a hair product---I'm just not the type!  But this conditioner is literally the best one I've ever used.  I first used it on my daughter, who has long straight hair.
6427;My dog didn't like this bone;My dog chewed on this for about 10 min., but then hasn't touched it again.
6428;Best sweetened almonds out there;I got these to use as stocking stuffers and they were a hit. Not too sweet and the vanilla flavor is so great.
6429;Extreme - maybe not, but definately good.;"""Issimo"" in Italian is an intensifier to an adverb much as we might say ""extremely"".  I don't consider the Illy Issimo Cappucino to be an extreme coffee drink but it is one that I enjoyed."
6430;Great Variety;My daughter loved all of them except the green beans, but she doesn't like green beans at all.  They do have onion in them as well.
6431;ridiculous;when i received my brach's bridge mix, it was  melted into one solid piece and unusable..
6432;MMMMM;Smooth, delicious, can't wait to wakeup with my coffee! I love all the Wolfgang Puck coffee flavors..
6433;Tasty, cheap, and convenient;I've been buying these soups as a matter of cheap thrills and convenience. They are probably best used as a no-fuss and light lunch st work and school.
6434;Rather weak and non-descript tea;There are several other Stash teas that I've tried and enjoyed. But this one is sort of feeble-tasting.
6435;Coconut oil is awesome!;This isn't my first purchase of the coconut oil. It's a great addition to any diet.
6436;Good Coffee;This is good coffee.  It is really low acid.
6437;Kind Plus Peanut Butter Dark Chocolate Bars;Have they changed the recipe? These aren't as good as they used to be.<br />I had them about 6 months ago and they just aren't as tasty.
6438;Excellent tea;This tea is absolutely delicious, my husband and I love it. It's very smooth and subtly sweet, and especially good mixed with a little green rooibos and a bit of white tea for a touch of caffeine.
6439;Good and hearty cereal;This cereal is good and will get you full and satiated. It is best mixed with a lighter cereal otherwise it is too hearty and heavy.
6440;Too thick!;Will not be buying this flavor again.  My 10 month old will not eat it.
6441;Guilt free decadence!!;Dove Sugar Free Peanut Butter Creme Chocolates are amazing.  Smooth, creamy, sweet, satisfying.
6442;Hungry for chocolate;This cookie has no chocolate flavor.  The texture is gritty and crumbly.
6443;So yummy;They taste so good. Easy on my stomach when I am running.
6444;Thank you, Dilmah!;Right this moment, i am enjoying my first cup of Dilmah tea..
6445;Great Taste;I've tried so many different Jasmine teas and this one is my favorite. There are some I just do not like.
6446;OK black tea - no real vanilla flavor though;I bought this because it said it was vanilla tea - but the vanilla flavor is not discernable. Not a bad tea though, like some other vanilla wannabes.
6447;Great Bars - Bad Image;Everything has been fine with this order:  Delivery time, quality, excellent taste.<br /><br />However, I was surprised to see a box of 20 when the picture showed a box of 24!<br /><br />In checking after I received the order it is clearly stated that it is a box of 20, which I didn't notice.
6448;It Was Just OK and Not Very Special;"I really like coffee, but overall I would rate this as ""okay"" tasting - it is very strong, and has a bit of a bite in the flavoring that made me get a piece of gum to get the taste out of my mouth.  After a couple of sips, I was done and would rate it a 3 out of 5 stars."
6449;Skippy Super Chunk Peanut Butter, 64-Ounce Containers (Pack of 2);This peanut butter is INCREDIBLY GOOD it is very chunky. If you are a freak for<br />chunky peanut butter like I am you will love this peanut butter.
6450;OH OH;I LOVE ALL OF ROLANDS OLIVES AS ANYONE CAN SEE FROM PASRT REVIEWS BUT I AM ALSO HONEST TO A T.<br />SOMEONE MIGHT LIKE THESE TYPE OF OLIVES,BUT THEY WERE CAUSTIC AND WAY WATY TO STRONG TASTING FOR ME.
6451;Food Writer;I have tried other food writers and they didn't do anything.  I couldn't get them to write on food and if they did, it wasn't a good clean line.
6452;They brought back the classic!;I, along with many others it seems, emailed Twizzlers when they changed their chocolate Twizzlers formula and made the twists with open ends.  I kind of forgot about it and converted to eating the strawberry ones because I just hated the new formula.
6453;Needs Modification;The reviewers who said the cake is flavorless or doesn't Taste good are right. Unfortunately I had already bought this sat the store and hadn't checked out the reviews and was loathed to return them.
6454;Great Product, Low Cost;In short, this product was about half what I had been paying it the store..
6455;The BEST!;I just ordered my 13th bag. I am so addicted to these it has become ridiculous.
6456;Delicious cup of coffee;Delicious cup of coffee. This is not the best coffee I have tasted but it is very enjoyable and I have not found one That I do not enjoy.
6457;If your tap water tastes like this, we should all move to where you live!;If this water tastes like your tap water, we should all live where you live!  My tap water is terrible and this is some of the best tasting water I have had.  I am already a regular drinker of PH water but it is  8.
6458;very pleased;I received the complete order in perfect condition in just a few days.  I've ordered them before with the same results, and will gladly order again.
6459;Developed problems after couple weeks;I have had my German Shepherd on Canidae (chicken) since she was a puppy and did wonderful. Well, Canidae had a recall last winter & I had to switch her, so I tried Wellness (chicken).
6460;Cafe D'vita Sugar Free cappuccino;I've been ordering this product for many years..
6461;Begone Toffee Hammer- I Have Andes!;I am so pathetic- I just discovered these bites of perfection. Creamy, dreamy European-like, milkish chocolate is enhanced with a toffee crunch that will not harm sensitive teeth.
6462;An Essential Ingredient in the Perfect Pie!;Oregon fruit pitted red tart cherries in water are the best pie and dessert cherries I've found.  They are not available in stores where I live.
6463;Beware .....incorrect weight;Although this is listed as a 5-lb (225 kg) bag, it is NOT.  It is only a 2.
6464;This changed my mind!;Normally I'm not a fan of any cookie (other than Oreo) unless its right out of the oven. To me there's just that something extra when it's nice and hot.
6465;First found this product at a food store in Lake Tahoe!  Thought they were great!;Fruit Nuts..
6466;Libby's splenda Fruit medley;I ALREADY PUCHASE LIBBY'S SPLENDA SWEETENED FRUIT IN THE SMALLER CANS.  I LOVE THE PRODUCT AND EXTREMELY HAPPY THEY CAME OUT WITH IT.
6467;Finicky cat;I can't really review this item because the cat for which I bought this product will not eat it.  I have another cat that does eat it, but he doesn't have a need for it.
6468;Good Beans;No complaints.  They are good black beans in a can.
6469;stinky tea;Seems to help, I sleep well and if I do wake up I'm not long getting back to sleep.<br />I ordered two boxes and I'm about to buy two more.
6470;Munch ... Munch! My two cats loved these treats;I broke each 'cookie' into many little bites, as soon as I did, they quickly devoured them.  I do have to say these are very filling, so expect to feed about 1/2 cookie per cat before they walk away.
6471;Excellent flavor;Excellent flavor. You might add a little bit Stevia to sweeten the mix.
6472;Organic...;I have been consuming olives and olive oil for years and years for its nutritional value. I cook with olive oil or use it as dressing or add few spoons into my dish since I need the good unsaturated fat contained in olives in in my diet.
6473;Seltzer with Lemon Marketed as High Quality Tonic;I'm absolutely in love with my Tanqueray & Tonics
6474;Bogie knows his treats;My large size dog loves these, he isn't an older dog, but I use them to give to him while I'm doing his nails. He gets a half per paw.
6475;Pill Pockets;My dog is on medication twice daily and used to take her pills with just peanut butter on them.  She now refuses to take them, I put the peanut butter on bread with the pills, she would eat around the pills and spit them out.
6476;I LOVE IRN BRU!!!;IRN BRU is, in my opinion, the best thing since sliced bread. I lived in Scotland for a while and for the past 11 years I have been searching for it wherever I go.
6477;My Fussy dogs eat this!;I have 4 adult Shih-Tzus and while they do prefer it when I cook for them..
6478;holland rusk;Loved this product for over fifty years. Found it again thru Amazon.
6479;Good snack;What can I say? It tastes great. Nice and cheap and it will last a long time.
6480;Yes, but try this;The previous review, faulting the Campofrio lomo because of its hardness, is accurate, and I was at first equally disappointed. But I hit on the idea of microwaving a slice, much as one might microwave stale bread to soften it.
6481;Easter Jello Jigglers Mold;This was a great product my kids enjoyed making easter Jell-O Easter eggs and bunnies. The mold came with a recipe book with coupons for money off Jell-O products.
6482;Baby likes it...;My son typically eats the Happy Baby brand but our grocery store was out of Happy Baby so we went for Plum instead (since he will not eat gerber).  This product is very similar to Happy Baby and costs less so it's a win in my book.
6483;Good Coffee at a good price;While I am getting over the sticker-shock of pod coffee, it's still cheaper than the coffee shop and I can keep my slippers on.<br /><br />This will give you a chance to find the coffee style you like but the inclusion of tea makes this more expensive than it needs to be.
6484;My Shihpoo vomited for 4 days;I found this product at PetSmart and gave it to my 14 lb. Shihpoo on Tuesday evening.
6485;Good, but inconsistent;Below is my previous review.  The next bag I ordered had a few strange pieces of red plastic stringy stuff.
6486;Lavazza Crema e Aroma Coffee;I really enjoy this expresso coffee, it is always smooth, never bitter<br />or over roasted to taste burned. It makes a wonderful cappucino, with<br />a frothy head, it has a nice frothy head in just a plain cup of espresso.
6487;They Got It Right.;Weaver's got it right with this one. Lot's of body,lots of depth.
6488;white rice IS brown rice...just naked...;"To the two-star review that has decided to eschew this product because the ingredients are ""white rice with rice bran"" instead of brown rice, that's a difference without distinction. Brown rice is unpolished white rice."
6489;5 Heads!;I receieved my plants in the mail after a couple days.  Like some, I have never bought a plant online either.
6490;Great product;This item was just as advertised. You can see exactly what is in the item.
6491;Great instant coffee;I first bought this when I was going on a trip and didn't know what the coffee situation would be - these far exceeded my expectations! The flavor is actually better than my machine brewed coffee (but not as good as the Melita drip coffee) and so convenient. I stock up whenever Amazon has these on sale! Great coffee.
6492;Freeze dried favorites.;These treats are my very picky Boston Terriers favorite.<br /> She is also finicky about dog food.
6493;Great product;I am using it for the bread machine I own. This is great to make your bread nice and soft.
6494;Earth Mother;The flavor is good, but the soup is quite thin.  It needs more barley and chunkier vegetables.
6495;DELICIOUS AND SWEET FOR GOOD ENERGY BOOSTERS!!!;THESE ARE PROBABLY THE BEST SUGAR RUSH SNACKS. I LIKE TO EAT THIS SO THAT I GET JUICED UP WHEN I NEEDED IN CLASS.
6496;Amazing Grass Amazing Product!;I have been using the Berry flavor in smoothies regularly for about 10 months, and Amazon is the best place to get it. The first couple of times I tried it, it was okay.
6497;Global Treasures Mulling Spices;Great service and execution of order. Each of the 24 packets of sugar free spice for hot apple juice or cider made nice stocking stuffers when combined with a pack of spice bags from Linen n Things.
6498;Great dehydrated salsa;This salsa is extremely flavorful & delicious. I highly recommend it.
6499;Fantastic;I purchased this candy and it is very very good. Each color has a distinct tast.
6500;I didnt believe it!;I was impressed. It smells like peanut butter & has the same consistency as peanut butter.
6501;smooth, soft and tasty;I've been using Satin Ice for a year now on my cakes.  I purchase it from local bakery supplies stores as well as online.
6502;Best shake for the price;"Have tried them ""all"" and this is by far the best shake out there for health, nutrition, taste and price.  Was on the Shaklee cinch shake when I started looking for a cold processed shake that wasn't as pricey."
6503;WARNING ---> MADE IN CHINA!;I didn't mind paying the $20+ a bag because my dog loved them. These are so expensive that I didn't look on the bag to see where they were made until ANOTHER recent recall on Chinese dog treats/food that was killing dogs.
6504;A good coffee, but not perfect;This is one more coffee on my quest for a perfect coffee. It's got the strong, dark flavor I want, but it has a bitter undertone that I do not want.
6505;You should like dark chocolate;I like the chocolate, but then I also liked dark chocolate to start with.<br /><br />I had a taste for 85% sweetened with sugar, but after enjoying the stevia 98%, I think that 85% tastes a little too bitter.
6506;Timothy's Hazelnut k-cups;Found this hazelnut k-cup bitter. Very bitter.
6507;Kettle Chips;I have found this product, Kettle Chips Unsalted to be fabulous.  I found them by accident on Amazon after hunting all over my local stores.
6508;So-so;Bought this for my bento boxes, since it was getting exhausting packing up everyone's unused ginger in a takeout container every time I visited a Sushi bar.<br /><br />Yes, this tastes like ginger, but its just mediocre.
6509;LOOOOVE these almonds!;I am so thrilled to find these on Amazon! I don't know why it didn't occur to me to look earlier. I love salt and vinegar potato chips and these definitely hit the same flavor spot.
6510;Cats would rather eat the cheap stuff. Oh well.;"I wanted to do better for my kitties than the cheap sludge that goes into most name brand cat foods, including some that used to be considered premium foods, but are now owned by the same old mega-conglomerates that make all the other stuff out of corn and ""byproducts"" instead of ingredients suitable for obligate carnivores.<br /><br />I really thought better cat food would be better for the cats, but they don't care."
6511;Better Than I Remember;I loved gummy bears as a kid..
6512;isn't chipotle;im from M&eacute
6513;No Maple Flavor - Tasted like perfume;I selected this instead of the other brands of maple tea because it seemed like a good value.  When I opened the package, there was no maple smell at all, just a perfume smell.
6514;A Summery Treat;"I adore watermelon, but things flavored with it tend to be artificial and icky, nothing like the perfect juicy fruit I love. However, I trust Red Leaf to deliver on authentic, juicy flavor, and boy did they ever! Though it smells kind of like a Jolly Rancher in the bag, the tea itself tastes nothing like ""watermelon"" flavored candy."
6515;Gluten Free Oatmeal in Bulk!;Once I found out that there was a gluten free oatmeal available, I was immediately enthralled by the idea of once again eating a normal healthy balanced breakfast. My husband and I typically eat this oatmeal 3-4 times a week, so we go through these bags very quickly.
6516;My favorite hot-sauce;This is my favorite hot sauce.  It has a rich, complex flavor, loaded with garlic and sweet hot chili peppers.
6517;Salty and vinegary!!!;These are the strongest tasting salt and vinegar chips I've had.  I could still do with more vinegar flavor, but I think this is as close as I'm going to get without dousing them with vinegar powder myself.
6518;Bang for your energy drink $ is here!!!;Energy drinks are considerably higher price than coke/pepsi etc.  Your bang for your buck is here on a product that tastes very very much like Red Bull.
6519;Mmmm good;I would say these are some of the better animal crackers that I have had. They also come in the right size to pack and take for my snack at work.
6520;Delicious and a great deal;"I picked up 2 cases of Reese Artichokes on a Friday Sale. These and <a href=""http://www."
6521;Best of the best;Been a major Altoids fan for years, but when Ginger Altoids showed up it became my instant favorite -- of course, those precious tins almost immediately became harder and harder to find until it's now virtually impossible to walk into a store and pick up a new supply.  [.
6522;Love these;So very convenient for on the go or at home. My 6 month old can eat this up really quickly with no mess.
6523;black jelly beans;Ordered product and waited for almost a month and a half and no shipment, company claimed it probably got lost in mail..
6524;Good, but not quite what I expected.;This sauce has a nice and sweet bbq flavor that is an interesting new twist. I'm looking forward to trying it with some fish, or maybe sushi.
6525;Lychee Gummies;The gummies are great.  I bought them 4 my mom and she ate them up.
6526;Canidae Dog Treats;"The Canidae dog treats has been well received by my 1 year old Presa Canarios.  The ""snap"" configuration of the treat works great since you can break off as much or as little as you want."
6527;Love them;My teenage daughter has dietary issues and can not eat regular chips. I buy these for her school lunches.
6528;Settlement, still worth buying;**UPDATE**<br />There is legal info on their website about the lawsuit.  From their side the calories were pretty close to their claim and the fat content was almost right on, but they didn't use the legal serving size.
6529;tasty;I was looking for a water mix-in without artificial sweetners. This uses Stevia, which I use at home.
6530;Best gluten-free cracker, I'm hooked;The flavor of these is pretty intense, but they've got me hooked. Hopelessly addicted to these.
6531;"""Thick"" is a relative term.";"Much as another reviewer indicates, these bully sticks were anything but ""thick"".  My dog goes through bully sticks on a regular basis and to even call them standard sized was an overstatement."
6532;Great rub, careful of product size.;This stuff is great.  No question.
6533;Chef I am not!;Since the lovely topic of food introduction has been brought up recently I decided to do my own research and came across this Beaba Babycook, boy am I happy that I did! I couldn't be happier with it. I am no Julia Child or Paula Deen, nor do I claim to be but with this little machine I do feel like my own version of a Top Chef.
6534;BEST CAT LITTER ON THE MARKET!!!;"I have tried many different ""scoopable"" cat litters in my years.  I had tried this litter (Fresh Step), but had decided on Tidy Cat for many, many years because it was cheaper than Fresh Step."
6535;Not a coffee drinker.;I'm not a coffee drinker, but I thought I'd give this a try since I like caramel lattes on occasion. Once I've added 1/2 & 1/2 plus a little sugar it has a good taste and a good balance of coffee/creamer/sugar to make it not sicky sweet like the barrista's version, but not to bitter which is why I don't like coffee.
6536;Love this chocolate;I love this chocolate. The Lindt bittersweet is great, and the larger size has a nicer bite when you eat a chunk.
6537;Great Tasting Dough that is usable with cookie cutters;This was very much like a non-GF dough.  Rolled out nice and cut out nice cookies with a variety of cookie cutters.
6538;Not a good Quality;This is the first time I am giving some negative review for the products that I bought. I have ordered this item to avoid tax and competitive price with Costco.
6539;Bahlsen Waffeletten Cookies;I am very happy with Amazon service including the speedy shipment. I am also very happy the product Amazon is carrying.
6540;Fantastic!;I have been drinking powdered cocoa for nearly 40 years.  I consider myself pretty familiar with the powdered/add water-type cocoas and most of them taste like sand.
6541;Red Raspberry Leaf Tea;I've a difficult time drinking red raspberry leaf tea in the past. I wanted to try it again during my second pregnancy for uterine health.
6542;My favorite of the soups;I hate been eating these bowls for YEARS.  This is NOT restaurant quality miso soup, the tofu is pathetic.
6543;black box gopher trap;"A friend of ours told us about the ""black box gopher trap"" and how effective it was.  I went to Amazon (my favorite on line shopping center), typed in the description, read the guys pitch, and bought one trap."
6544;No need to eat candy bars again!!;These are great, way better than a Snickers and healthier. Great to carry one with me when I am out for the day.
6545;Fantastic post dinner tea;If you ever suffer from any stomach distress after eating then this tea is for you. It's pleasant tasting so no sugar is needed, has no caffeine and is a great replacment for less healthy caffeinated teas.
6546;Yumminess in a bag;I love the Kimchi flavored seaweed.  I have tried just about every flavor that Tao Kae Noi makes and Kimchi is by far my favorite.
6547;Intense nutty flavor with convenience;I was dubious about dry peanut powder when we first encountered PB2 but it is delicious and convenient for making up small quantities of fresh peanut butter.  Our vegan teen loves it.
6548;Expensive but convenient although a little weak;Well, I was a little disappointed in these Twinings K-cups.  The reason being that while waiting for these guys to come in the mail I tried some normal Twinings english breakfast teabags beforehand.
6549;Five stars? Really?;I think people are reviewing this product based on how pretty the  box and each individual wrapping looks. To me these taste like flowers.
6550;Yuck!;These were the sweetest tasting, icky, sticky fruit twisters.  My son is addicted to candies and I thought these would remind him of fruit roll ups.
6551;Good price for a highly rated dog food;I feed three large dogs and one small dog with this dog food.  I've used it about three months.
6552;White Peach Oolong Yum!;I am a bit of a Tea Crazy (I counted last week and found I have over 40 boxes at home, because I drink a TON of green and chamomile tea and have some others, too. I started drinking Oolong tea about two years ago and really enjoyed it - this one is no exception.
6553;looks like a good product but no directions.;They put the SKU right over the directions on how to rehydrate. There are no directions on their website and I am stuck with a product I can't use.
6554;good tea;I got this tea at my local store and really like the flavor. I add a little milk to it to get rid of the bitterness.
6555;Very tasty;Great for on the go, I work in a job that I don't always got to eat lunch on time so grabbing a bar is a great way to eat. These are great, the only thing is that it comes in a 5 pack because 2 bars are in each pack.
6556;best snack food;I've only tried the raspberry so far. They are awesome.
6557;Awesome Treats!!;both my 14 week old aussie and 60 lb cattle dog mix love them! perfect for training
6558;The Rub You Crave;I was given the 3-pack by a friend of mine and I have to say that this person is definitely my best friend for life. I should begin by stating that I LOVE chicken wings - I try them everytime I see them on a menu.
6559;Morning Bliss!!!;For all of you espresso fans!!! You must try this blend.<br /><br />It's smooth and has a fabulous taste, and the price is nice.
6560;Good Stuff!;I don't really like microwave popcorn, at all, but this is an exception.  This is really good popcorn!  I also recommend black jewell popcorn (non-microwave) made on the stove.
6561;Hard to Find;We could not find this product in our local stores, (We tried six different stores including 2 super market chains, 3 walmarts, and 2 pet stores.) so we had to order it here.
6562;Shine On;Miracle-Gro Leaf Shine made my plants look like a hundred bucks.  And it doesn't have a strong odor which is great for those of us allergy ridden types.
6563;Lives up to its name;I'm in the latter months of pregnancy and it is becoming harder and harder to get a good nights sleep. In lieu of not being able to find my go-to Chamomile at the grocery, I reached for Bedtime Story since in the tag line it expressed being Caffeine Free and made with Real Spearmint and Chamomile Flowers.
6564;Now they finally post a picture...;When I bought these beans, there was no picture. only the ounces and pack sizes.
6565;Great way to sample;This variety oack is a great way to sample several of the flavors green mountain has to offer.  I would have preferred to receive more than one of the cinnamon roll and fewer of some of the other flavors.
6566;Best Teething Biscuits;These are the teething biscuits that my grandson loves!  I have tried the others, but these are what he wants.  Please get them in soon.
6567;correct size, tasty cereals;"The box is ideal for travel and for kids. This is for sweet craved, and is one of my favorites apart from the <a href=""http://www."
6568;jet fuel K-cups coffee;I truly like Kona Blend much more. Furthermore,I don't believe it creates more energy.
6569;tastes great, good for your teeth;I've never been a gum chewer, but after my last visit to the dentist I was directed to take on the habit.  Apparently chewing xylitol gum can help kill off cavity-causing bacteria in your mouth.
6570;Way to salty for snacking.....;I would not buy these again.  They are so salty and leave a briney aftertaste.
6571;Getting Pass the Superficial;Most of us (girls mostly) grew up running away from, chasing, or killing this little insect. You'd never think of actual eating one.
6572;Not really K-Cups;Im a little disappointed. These aren't really k-cups and I find that they do not stay as fresh.
6573;Overpriced;I got the same product at my local grocery store for $9.99.
6574;Bold flavor;"First of, I didn't really know what to expect when I ordered this coffee.  Come to find out the ""single serve pods"" are flat, round cushions that require a special coffee maker."
6575;Great Coconut Oil;Great coconut oil at a reasonable price. I found the product to be high quality, light and wonderful tasting, fine texture.
6576;Nutritious, Delicious and Easy;This is a wonderful whole grain mix without a bunch of refined ingredients or preservatives.  Our son is allergic to egg and dairy and these come out great without either
6577;The Student;From everything I can tell, these (cacoa) are really good for your body and brain. Much can be said about them.
6578;"If you can call chocolate ""sexy....""";After my experience with the Amedei Limited Edition Chuao bar, also available on Amazon, I had to expand my horizons with Amedei and will endeavor to write reviews on all of their products. For those of you who have tried Amedei products before, you'll recognize this as blatant self-serving, but for the rest of you let me assure you that I only have the most noble of motives - to provide an honest review based upon personal experience.
6579;If you like real tea;I very much enjoy Lyons Original Blend tea. Lyon's is a very good, robust, satisfying cup of tea.
6580;Another satisfied pet owner;We've had dogs and cats for years and always fed them Science Diet or Iams.  Our newest dog was an itcher and after research, I decided to try a new dog food.
6581;Happy Hips Duck Breast is a great treat;After finding these at Target, I bought some for my dogs.  They absolutely love them!  At $6.
6582;Very Tasty & Healthy Oatmeal;This oatmeal is full of flavor and is a quality product. I agree with the previous reviewer that it's wonderful with bananas and walnuts or pecans.
6583;fun while it lasts;This is a great interactive toy.  We used it for every feeding.
6584;ALL MY CAT LOVE THIS FLAVOR;I WAS LOOKING TO CHANGE CAT FOOD, ALL MY CATS ARE GETTING UP THERE IN AGE AND GAINING WEIGHT, I WAS LOOKING FOR A FOOD THE WAS NATURAL AND LOW FAT,  AFTER READING SEVERAL REVIEWS ABOUT THIS PRODUCT<br /> I FOUND THIS BRAND ON AMAZON, SO GLAD I DID, THEY SEEM TO ENJOY IT. DON'T KNOW ABOUT WEIGHT GAIN YET, JUST STARTED USING IT SO FAR LOOKS PROMISING.
6585;Good decaf;This is a good decaf coffee, it has a good flavor.  I like a stronger coffee, so this one is fits the bill.
6586;Great product... confused dog :o);My dog absolutely LOVES these..
6587;Extremely satisfied;I am extremely satisfied with the product. It tastes better than any of the other Indian packaged ready-to-eat products.
6588;Best tasting;I have tried coconut oil from local stores like Trader Joes and they were okay, but love the nutty taste of Nutiva. I also like buying in quantity since there are so many uses for coconut oil.
6589;Stopped my leg cramps...;I've been drinking a bit of this mixed in water before bed, and my night leg cramps have stopped. 'nuff said.
6590;I dont like it, but my GF does;And i bought it for her so i'll let her review stand. She loves it!<br />Im more of a Standard Green Tea guy, but she really likes this blend.
6591;Excellent, Very Tasty. Love it!;Tasty. Very restaurant-like.
6592;tasty flavors;I love bars in a couple different flavors, including chocolate chip. Mostly because they do not contain high fructose syrup, and also because they provide a healthy in between meals snack.
6593;Awesome Stuff!;I've been buying these for years. They are not only delicious but perfect for a cookout, picnic, tailgate etc.
6594;Sauce of the Gods;This is good on anything.  I use it just as a condiment and to cook.
6595;It's OK.;My cats enjoy inclined ramps to scratch, and it helps save the chair arms and the bed box-spring!  I like the fact that it is made from recycled materials, comes put together, and is not expensive.  It also arrived quickly.
6596;Very Good Cat Food but...;My Cat Loved it so I did give it 4 stars for quality and taste.<br />My one problem with it, and the reason I didn't give it 5 stars, is that Petite Cuisine is made in Thailand.
6597;Good but not impressive;Bought this at Ralphs, 1 for $4.49 to try and was unimpressed.
6598;Great Coffee but please stop smoking and put some instructions on the box!;Marley Coffee & Tea One Love Organic Coffee makes a tasty cup of coffee.  However, I have to say that nowhere on the box, or the individual packets, are instructions for actually making the coffee.
6599;Best unsalted chips;These are the best unsalted chips around and we have tried many.  They have the best potato flavor.
6600;Not a fan of this strawberry flavor;I looovee strawberry ice cream and I enjoy strawberry milk. Unfortunately, I did not like this strawberry flavored protein shake very much.
6601;Other energy drinks don't work for you?  Try a bottle of 5-hour;First, as other reviewers here have already done, i want to emphasize that different bodies react differently to products such as this.  These are my own experiences with the products, and your mileage may vary.
6602;awesome tasting!;Best tasting coffee. Love dark roast with a bit of a bite.
6603;UTI;My husband is a paraplegic and was having UTIs constantly.  Since he started drinking a cup of this tea every morning, he hasn't had a UTI for a year.
6604;Good Blend, but roast was too light.;I like the taste, but the light roast was too light for me.  I find myself brewing smaller cups of coffee, hoping for a stronger taste.
6605;Good stuff;I normally feed Embark which has more protein but tried this. Dog loved it of course (he is a lab!) but there was more poo than with Embark so I went back to that.
6606;Didn't care for the taste of these ...;I love Chinese almond cookies and these were a brand name, but they are tasteless.  And no almond on top like you get in a Chinese Restaurent.
6607;pluverized not shredded;this item is just mediocre in taste, but what was disturbing was the shredded aspect. not by my definition.
6608;Nothing earth-shattering to report.;This is by far, the worst smelling, worst tasting supplement known to man.  It is so far worse than anything GNC sells.
6609;Just OK;I split this can with my spouse.  I would have given it 2 stars, he gave it 3.
6610;Garlic salt;Best product.  You can use it in any type of food.
6611;Happy Customer;Thank you so much for making this product .it is hard to find items made with flax i wish more could be made.
6612;Cherry tea is awesome!;We have been buying this tea for years.  Wissotzky is a brand you can really trust.
6613;Cheaper than my grocery store;If you are looking at this cereal, most likely you already know it's good. Love the cinnamon and the vanilla.
6614;Amora rocks;If you go to the French version of Target (Auchan), this mustard is one of the cheaper brands and on the bottom shelf.  My wife and I chose it because at the time we were in graduate school and money was tight.
6615;Good strong coffee (new favorite), and a bit better for the environment!;"This is my new favorite ""k-cup"" (it's not a k-cup but it fits in all Keurig machines)! It's very strong, but not bitter or burnt--it's just plain great coffee.  I wish I had invented this cheaper version of a k-cup, because this design is genius."
6616;natural, delish and full of good for you monounsaturated fats but low in sugar;I'll admit I was not at all sure why, when I bought my contact lens solution, there was a special deal that I get this kind bar free. I knew there was hidden target marketing in their somewhere but I simply couldn't fathom what it was.
6617;Satisfied!;Tastyy! I Loved the deal, best price i could find online. Gave one to my friend & kept the other to enjoy along with my family.
6618;tully's decaffeinated coffee;This is the best tasting coffee. You will like it even if you enjoy regular coffee.
6619;My fa fa favorite!;Love this stuff.  It has one of the best combinations of chocolate and mexican spice flavors of any I have tried.
6620;Instant Coffee;"<a href=""http://www.amazon."
6621;Not like the chews for larger dogs;My dog loves these.  However, these are chewed up and swallowed up in about 5 seconds.
6622;Delicious cinnamon cereal;"Tasty, easy-to-eat, bite-size, cinnamon flavored cereal.  Kids report that they ""taste healthy"" because they aren't loaded with sugar, but nevertheless they taste good."
6623;Sweet Jasmine;I am a long-time green tea consumer.  I switched from coffee to green tea when I learned about the beneficial effects of green tea.
6624;Walkers Oatcakes;They are as good as they have been for years.  I'm glad to be able to get them here in Arizona.
6625;Too many grainy impurities;There are too many grainy impurities.  Avoid this product if you were planning on grinding your own flax seeds for drinking in shakes.
6626;Great Holiday tradition;Our family has been giving and recieving Kringle for many years. It is one of our Danish tradtions.
6627;Delicious;My new favorite snack.  While visiting my son in Richmond, had the opportunity to try these.
6628;Stash Earl Grey Decaf;Great price for decaf Earl Grey that sometimes is hard to find on shelves of grocery store. Stash tea is a brand that you can count on too.
6629;Not my favorite...;Not as tasty as traditional Rosarita beans but, duh, these are fat-free so I'm not surprised. (I decided to try these because they're half the price.
6630;Balanced strength and taste;By far my favorite of the Senseo pods.  The introduction of the Kona blend into the rotation at the office Senseo machine has been for the better.
6631;Solid GF protein to have on hand;My daughter and I have Celiac Disease and in our experience, lunch is the hardest meal of the day. When we are at home we are fine, but when we are at work or school, it is either difficult to find safe Gluten Free food or a clean enough location in which to eat that food without contaminating it by all the meals previously eaten there.
6632;mommy milk is the best;i would say,compare to the MM brand giving the same supply BUT this one just too hard for me to drink.It taste horrible.
6633;Good all-round cracker;This is a good all-round cracker, for eating with meals (salads, soups) or snacks (dips, cheese, spreads) It seems more nutritious than a lot of crackers, but doesn't taste like cardboard -- in fact it's very tasty -- light, crisp and good enough for munching plain right out of the box for snacks.  Good to have in the pantry for any time you need crackers.
6634;WONDERFUL;wish this product wasn't so hard to find.  makes the best soups ever.
6635;good flavor but not strong enough;This is my first purchase of Senseo coffee pods. The package coming with the coffee machine is unflavored, so I went online to buy this French vanilla from Amazon.
6636;Helpful for arthritis pain;It took using one whole bottle before I saw results, but results are what we were looking for! This is a mild, natural way to help your dog with stiffness in his joints from arthritis. It mixes easily with their food, and apparently either tastes good, or has no taste at all, because my dog never seemed to care that I started adding it.
6637;Agave Syrup @ Amazon;I used to use splenda and of course before that the blue and the pink stuff.  Agave syrup is perfect for my brewed gallons of iced green/peach tea or a drop or two over cottage cheese and fruit with toasted almonds.
6638;Great tea, great price!;After much experimenting, I'm a totally devoted fan of Rishi Teas but I make one exception and Numi's Jasmine Pearls is it.  Jasmine pearl tea is my favorite tea, hands down, but as any jasmine pearl lover knows, it ain't cheap!  This tea is a great value AND tastes good.
6639;Miss the jars;I bought what was left from this site due to Gerber decided to discontinue the glass jars and use the plastic containers. Well the glass jars are much easier to travel and heat up with and easier to store in the fridge.
6640;Kids Mixed Reviews;My daughters(6&8) Love the Berry Blast oatmeal packets..
6641;Dogs went wild for it, cat not so much;"I tested this product out on two dogs and a cat. Daisy, my neighbor's border collie, went ""absolutely ape"" for it, in the words of her owner."
6642;Excellent meat glue;Excellent product. I used this stuff to create an entire vest out of flank steak.
6643;Safe healthy food for your cat;My cat thoroughly enjoys this food, and she can be a picky eater. She would not touch the other flavors of Blue Buffalo, before they changed the shape and style of the food.
6644;Frankie loves Chicken Soup;Our short hair 5 year old male cat, Frankie, loves this food. We give him the dry form.
6645;Made in China, buyer beware!;Waggin' Train, Canyon Creek and Milo's Kitchen treats are being investigated by the FDA after more than 1,000 dog deaths related to kidney failure were reported.<br /><br />Don't accidentally hurt your best friend.
6646;Very nice snack food;"This is a nice-tasting ""granola"" product, and it's on the crunchier end of granola products that I've tried. Though it has a strange finish in the taste, that's more obvious in this flavor than the other."
6647;Tasty, but disappointed;The listing of the box describes as twice as many bars as there are servings.  Each foil pouch contains two very small bars, which together make one serving.
6648;Campbell's Mushroom Gravy;My personal opinion:  I love it! To me it is delicious and so convenient to have on hand. I subscribed to it.
6649;Delicious and Satisfying;I'm giving them four stars instead of five because of the sugar content. It has 13 grams of sugar, which is rather high.
6650;My favorite flavor of this brand is Bangkok Curry!;Absolutely delicious, light, gluten-free, low calorie, inexpensive lunch! I am on a perpetual diet, and nothing has made me happier than this soup. I like ramen soup, but the problem with regular Maruchan ramen is that it has msg and wheat (gluten) and also twice the sodium per packet and its preserved with TBHQ.
6651;Great for stomach issues;A friend of mine told me about the ginger honey crystals. She gave me one to try and I was hooked.
6652;excellent food;The Honest Kitchens formulas are human grade raw ingredients and offer a variety of grain free formulas that I cannot find elsewhere. I use this as a base for my raw diet which consists of a rotation of chicken, turkey, duck and lamb.
6653;Newman's Canned Chicken & Brown Rice;I have an 8 year old Morkie who has been sick all of her life with Pancreatitis, Kidney and Thyroid issues, pre-diabetic status, ear and fungal infections, allergies, various tumors, and the list goes on and on. Recently, she had two severe cases of Hemorragic Gastro Interitis within a month's time, and I almost lost her.
6654;Food arrived in poor condition;The chocolate on the bars was whitened, and the bars were dry and stale.  I returned the bars.
6655;Williams Chili Seasoning is the New Grandma's brand seasoning;This really does match the Grandma's chili seasoning that no longer is available. I put a taste of my last-remaining Grandma's seasoning on my finger and tasted it, next I put a taste of Williams Chili Seasoning on my tongue and it was a match.
6656;GF/SF;Our family is gluten-free and sugar-free (and some are dairy-free).  We recently discovered these and love them!  Not really like a cookie as we used to know them, but still a fun treat.
6657;Good Way to Explore;I've been curious about finishing salts but wasn't sure which salt would be the best to use.  This starter set is allowing us to really explore the differences in flavor, color, and grain size.
6658;tea review;This is a very satisfying and plesant tea.  After 45 years of drinking and enjoying coffee it began to disagree with me.
6659;Creepy;These are pretty interesting..
6660;Awesome!;This organic french roast coffee is flavorful with out being burnt tasting.  I don't understand the last time I ordered this was under $13 - my has jumped quite a bit.
6661;Much Better Than Expected;I really like how the sauce is seperate from the pasta so you can place it on a plate without making a mess.  Taste and appearance where very good.
6662;Twinings is the best Earl Grey;I have tried three varieties of Earl Grey now and I am amazed and somewhat pleased by how different they all are as it allows for different tastes.  Twinings has a light, bright slightly citrus flavor that I love.
6663;Another error, Wake up!;"Here's another 4.4lb bag of dog food that does not represent the normal ""regular"" price."
6664;Wonderful Natural Sweetener;Any of the Wholesome brand Organic Blue Agave sweeteners are wonderful.  They taste great and they do the trick in sweetening your drink (or whatever you want to sweeten :-)  Because it is sweeter than sugar (at least to me it is) I find that I only need a little squirt, probably less than a teaspoon for a 24 oz cup of tea.
6665;EWWW;This coffee tastes like jet fuel.  The price is great, but the coffee isn't great.
6666;5 Stars. As Expected if You've Ever Tried Maruchan.;These are as expected from previously eating them. Great price when on sale.
6667;Love Amazon's subscription process;This is an o.k.
6668;Popcorn better than oil popped or microwave.;This is now our favorite popcorn. We have long since stopped using microwave popcorn because it was either too greasy or chewy.
6669;To dry and crunchy and little flavor;Tibet authentic are much better, in my opinion.  They are moist and chewey like raisins, but more dense and flavorful.
6670;Healthy and Simple;I'm so happy to have found a high quality wet food for my miniature dachshund. Our family really believes that high quality food is important for a long and healthy life
6671;Love this tea;Better than many I have tried.  With a little honey this is a terrific cup of tea.
6672;disappointed;Love the rice..
6673;yea - high protein and vegetarian - but a bit bitter;Kind of bitter. I recommend buying on first in a store before buying a case.
6674;Good for limited diets;My dogs had to be on food with limited ingredients for a while and this was the best of the types I tried. The dogs ate it easily (although without great gusto) and it helped us get through the medical issues that precipitated our use of it.
6675;Tried many foods before settling on this one;In a household with two dogs, we have several requirements for our dog food.  We have a Great Dane and a Samoyed.
6676;One of the best teas I've found;As a daily tea drinker, my husband and I found this at an ethnic grocery, but that was the last time I could find it until VOILA Amazon had it.  This tea is so fresh, smooth, and invigorating that anyone who tries it will be in concurrence! It's black Ceylon/Sri Lanka tea.
6677;BEST EVER;"I am unable to buy ""hulless"" popcorn in my area. This is the first time since my young days that I have enjoyed this type of popcorn."
6678;A Yummy Snack;I would tell anyone who loves cheese to buy CHEEZ-IT baked crackers. They have a great taste and make a great snack! I use them to top my vegetable casseroles.
6679;Best Waffle mix available;I purchased this because of the waffles that I have had at the Holiday Inn Express and Staybridge Suites for the past two years.  Got the name of the mix during a recent stay and ordered it.
6680;Great alternative for paleo or grain-free snacking;These guys make great alternative granolas -- banana, apple, cocoa, and cappucino. A tasty, filling alternative to the junk we often reach for when hungry.
6681;Hershey's Special Dark cocoa is the Best!;For dieters and any chocolate lovers, this product will satisfy, and for only 5 calories per Tablespoon! It's very dark so it adds a richness to any baked recipe. Unfortunately it is not widely available in stores.
6682;Nothing else even compares!;This is a truly unique product..
6683;Good and Bad;I have been using Pamela's for almost a year and find that it makes yummy pancakes, waffles, cookies and drop biscuits. I use it as a replacement coating for fried chicken, chicken fried steak and fried zuchinni.
6684;Not as good as Celestial Seasonings;I have to admit I'm more than a little disappointed in this tea. I had high hopes after trying Bigelow's Raspberry flavored herbal and black teas.
6685;Follow the directions;This is a quality tea that requires you to follow the directions.  My first attempt was by using my old method that works well with a different brand of tea.
6686;This product kicks serious butt!;We purchased this product because one stray cat we brought into the house had fleas. We plugged the product in and one hour later there were at least a dozen fleas stuck to the trap like glue! We have used it for a month and the trap is full! The trap is replaceable but since fleas are small, you can get a lot of life out of one.
6687;Nice product;I was a little skeptical at first, but this thing really does grow some nice plants. I have been enjoying fresh basil and mint lately, and they are very nice and quite flavorful.
6688;Too good to be true;These treats don't last, my dog can pop them out in a matter of minutes, and it's completely gone in about 5 minutes.  Add to that the seller I purchased from only sent me one (they come in packs of 2, seller opened it and only sent me one treat), I was very disappointed.
6689;This Coffee hits the spot!;In a nutshell..
6690;Not for me;Wow! This really hurts me to do this, but I have to give this syrup the lowest review it has gotten yet. This was my first time ordering  Hidden Springs Vermont Maple Syrup, and I did so because the other brands weren't available in the 1 Half Gallon variety.
6691;Good, had better though;Having had Jack Links jerky for a while I picked up this brand during one of Amazon's deals to try it out. While it is nice and the smokey flavour works well, there is a much sweeter flavour to it than Jack Links brand.
6692;Couldn't be better;Wow! As with virtually all Newman's Own products, this is the best. I've tried just about every brand, including a number of organic chocolates, and this beats them all.
6693;Great Product / not thrilled with assortment sent;I love these Flavor & Fiber bars -- they are great to grab for breakfast or a quick bite when you don't have a lot of time. I follow Weight Watchers and these are only 4 points, and they're very tasty and satisfying.
6694;They're Goo Goo Good!!!;Absolutely the closest approach to perfection known to have been created by mere mortals.<br /><br />The only real question is why this is not the national confection.
6695;Taste good but bad consistency;I used to get these oats when I first started eating GF.  However after eating steel cuts oats for a year or more I wanted a break and went back to rolled oats.
6696;Good coffee;This is a good choice. It let me try all the different coffees and decide which one I liked enough to purchase.
6697;Wonderful mix of green tea and chai flavor;I like drinking green tea for the health benefits, but I find that many are either boring-tasting or bitter, especially without the addition of added sugar.  Luckily, I discovered Stash Chai Green Tea, which tastes great completely on its own!  It is a wonderfully fragrant tea with a tasty combination of spices, including cinnamon, ginger, allspice, nutmeg, clove, and cardamom.
6698;Made my dog sick!!;From just two days of giving these treats to  my dog she started having bloody diarrhea, less appetite and that's when I googled information about chicken jerky and was horrified about what I found. I can't believe I bought this at a Wholefoods store.
6699;Haribo does make kids happy and also grown ups ;
6700;Fantastic tasting healthy or not!;These chips are great for snacking regarless that they are healthy!  They don't taste like health food but they are.  I love the vinegar and sea salt the best.
6701;Outstanding!!!;I placed an order for my 14th anniversary.  I am currently serving in Iraq and ordered 7 dozen so 14 dozen were to be shipped to my wife back home in the states.
6702;One out of three cats partially liked it;I have three cats, one is 12 years old (Fred), one is 9 years old (Jewel) and a kitten that is 4 months old (Angel).  The kitten is very finicky and was recently weaned off her milk
6703;Bad stomach ache and diarrhea!;Be forewarned! These gummy bears are tasty, but if you eat more than a couple at a time, you will get a bad tummy ache and diarrhea. On top of that, there are no nutritional information available, so who knows whether they are actually completely sugar free, and I also wonder about the carbohydrate content.
6704;Timothy's Italian Blend is Yummy!;I'm not really a coffee connoisseur.  I normally go with a flavored or mild coffee, but I really like the Timothy's Italian Blend.
6705;made my dog sick;After finding out whats in Beggin Strips these were recommended to me by a client.  I am a dog groomer.
6706;Doggies love 'em;Since I have been seeing so many recalls not only on dog food but treats, I decided to look for something that is made in this country and found these.  My two Pom's love them and it is their morning treat.
6707;Great Fruit Bar;Organic Fruit. No Sugar.
6708;IF YOU HAVE A PEANUT ALLERGY, BEWARE;My husband says these pretzels are great and he loves them.  However, on the box I saw a warning that says the pretzels are made in a facility that produces peanut butter.
6709;My dog's favorite;The ingredients are really wholesome. And, fast delivery!<br />It would be nice if they had some type of fish formula though.
6710;Good product, nicely packed..;This is one of the ingredients I insist to add to almost every spicy Indian dish that we cook. It adds a special taste to any food.
6711;Great herbal tea;Do you love the taste of licorice? If so, this tea is for you. I used to be able to buy it from retail grocery stores but they no longer carry it.
6712;"DARE You to Eat just ""1"" Bag!";Oh My - these are going on my list to re-order! They are absoultely DELCIOUS! Actually like them a lot better than the Oreos with cream in the middle. Crispy, crunchy, low cal cookie (if you can eat only 1 bag, that is).
6713;great as cookies;This brownie mix doesn't bake at 7000 feet altitude, but it works super well as chocolate/chocolate chip cookies. Makes 24.
6714;Fast service;My local grocer stopped carrying David pumpkin seeds, so I was delighted to find them available at Amazon.  Ordered two boxes (12 bags to the box) and regular delivery was faster than expected.
6715;Great for carb management;Obviously rice isn't a low-carb food per se, but this wild blend has significantly less impact on my blood sugar than the jasmine variety I grew up eating. It's flavorful and has a wonderful chew -- and it cooks up just fine in a rice cooker (we use 1.
6716;Not so good;I LOVE Green Mountain coffee.  I use it all the time for my k cups.
6717;Great Ham Hocks;The ham hocks were very good!!! I enjoyed them very much!!! I will make this purchase again. Thanks for order.
6718;my dog loves these;My 3 year old miniature schnauzer loves these bones. I'm really glad that they started making them wheat-free because he has food allergies.
6719;Aluminum Free!;This baking soda works great for cooking or for health reasons.  I take it for acid indigestion and heart burn.
6720;Good, but not too hot.;This is a pretty decent horseradish for using straight on your meat or what have you. Not too hot.
6721;Hardcore Dairy Man;"I've been eating ice cream for over 50 years, and the thought of non-dairy ""ice cream"" didn't appeal to me, until I tried your product.."
6722;good, balanced and reasonable;We tried several of the higher end foods including avoderm
6723;Good nonfat milk powder;This is the first time I can remember buying Dry Non-Fat Milk Powder but I thought I'd give it a try considering that a gallon of milk at the grocery store is nearing 4.00.
6724;USA Made Treat;My dogs went crazy over these. They have a very strong fish smell, but if you like to make your dog happy, it's a great treat.
6725;Good Taste;This wildrice mix tasted just a mite too hard after cooking but if you left it for very long it got mooshy..
6726;Nutritious and Delicious;Since becoming a diabetic, I have studied foods in an attempt to better control my blood sugar.  Some foods (like ones with lots of sugar) spike my blood sugar.
6727;Finally a protein bar I can digest;I can't eat most of the protein bars because the protein in them don't digest well (whey, soy, milk).  But this one (proto whey) is really great.
6728;Good value but dented cans;Same thing as above - my grocery store stopped carrying vegetable broth so I looked online. I use vegetable broth A LOT, so this is a really good value.
6729;Good Snack;I bought a pack of these at Krogers and really liked them, good taste and healthy snack. I went back to buy more and Krogers and raised the price to $1.
6730;understated, natural-flavored coffee;"I have a bad image of flavored coffees because, so often, tons of artificial flavor is used to cover up bad coffee and sell it as ""premium"".  This coffee is better than that."
6731;memorable collection of confections;If you're ever near Savannah (GA) swing down to their waterfront River Street.  River Street Sweets takes up the better part of a block.
6732;The Best Hurricane Mix You Will Ever Have;When I went to Mardi gras 2008 I discovered this amazing drink concoction at Pat O'Brien's on Bourbon St. We drank these every day we were there (5 days) & couldn't get enough of them.
6733;OK, but Check the Pricing;Dr. Oz recommended this brand of coconut water.
6734;Organic In A Time of Crisis... Pumpkin Crisis that is!;I was unable to get any canned pumpkin in the grocery stores due to the pumpkin shortage.  I use it every week and was out of it, so I turned to Amazon.
6735;Tasty;I liked the spicy wasabi flavor very much. I didn't expect this very small snack to curb my hunger but it did.
6736;Horizon Organic Strawberry Milk;"<a href=""http://www.amazon."
6737;Best Invention;I had gone to the vet and I got these for my dog and she absolutely loves them! It has no foul smell although it does smell a little weird on your fingers so wash them but thats normal. Its as simple as you take a little bit or the whole treat and stick medicine or a pill inside of it and cover the pill and they will eat it right away!Its vet approved and very safe for dogs to eat so dont be worried but read the ingredients just in case.
6738;Very satisfied;Very satisfied with this purchase.  Everything came as expected.
6739;Great treats;These treats are perfect for training. They taste AMAZING - I eat them myself, too! They're small, they dissolve quickly, and they're fairly smelly.
6740;sugar is good;
6741;GREAT FOOD!;Good reviews and my Maltese loves it!  We buy and switch up all the flavors.  I usually mix with their dry small bites (also very good).
6742;Victoria;Pay no attention to one of the bad reviews above. This person has not clue how to cook buckwheat properly.
6743;okay;I bought these to pack in my pre-school daughter's lunch to try to add some variety to her gluten-free diet. She tried one bite of the Pink Pineapple flavor and refused to eat any more.
6744;Excellent product, very tasty;I have used this product for several years and it makes wonderful yogurt and has some of the most useful bacteria in it.  I make a batch then take a sample out and put it in the freezer to use for the next batch.
6745;Fresh and Yummy;"Worth every penny - fresh and well packed from Maine to Seattle in one day.  Packed in 2 pound ""netted"" packages surrounded with ""blue ice"" packages for refrigeration."
6746;Having a long overdue saffron rice orgy! ;
6747;GREAT POPCORN;Beyond GOOD, excellent. Never buying microwave popcorn again, 200-300 for a popcorn maker and your in business.
6748;A hot, bold and tasty snack!;I love Blue Diamond Almonds and this bold flavor gives you a spicy hot choice for a snack.  They are rich in vitamin E, magnesium and calcium while only being 170 calories for one serving.
6749;Blue Corn Chips Taste Really Good;These corn chips are crispy and taste great. And very few broken chips in the bag (I like my chips whole).
6750;GREAT CATFOOD;"Because of our cat's digestive problems, and due to multiple unsuccessful trials of other ""top"" brands of canned cat food, led us to try the WELLNESS brands. Our feline-centric veterinarian concurred, and I am happy to report that after 2 weeks, our cat is responding wonderfully!<br /><br />He is a ""new"" cat! He LOVES THIS FOOD! A great, all-natural product."
6751;Hot tea;With winter coming, I drink these hot.  When I was sick, I started to make a hot tea and lemon then realized the ice teas already had that.
6752;"Doggie ""crack""....Lol!";I ordered this, not sure if my dogs would like the roller ball or turn their noses up at it, but I'm happy to report they loved it! They went at it with gusto-so much so that I had to put it away after only a few licks-afraid they might make themselves sick. Little did I know that my little monsters would find a way to knock it off the shelf & absolutely destroy the bottle while I was at the grocery store.
6753;WONDERFUL stuff-- you'll never go back to plain table salt after you try this!;Tasty AND good for you, what more could you want from a salt?  Good price too.  Definitely get the coarse kind and grind it yourself for the best flavor.
6754;Good but pricey..;I love the cinnamon mentos and they are hard to find in my area. I would probably not purchase them again unless the price goes down.
6755;Love these;These are a great meaty snack to keep at your desk.  They've got a great smoky flavor and a velvety texture, and the casing has just the right amount of pop.
6756;Watch Out For The Bait And Switch!;I ordered this product for basically an emergency situation with a pre-mature child.  I really needed this product and needed it fast.
6757;Prepare to chew;Please note that I think this product deserve 3 1/2 Stars rather than 4. But this is not star search and amazon wont let you.
6758;Okay, not great.;While they were good, they were not as good with some of the other fruit filled cereal we have.  A lot of crushed shredded wheat was on the bottom, probably from handling during shipping.
6759;Great on vegetables and chicken;A friend gave us a bottle of this and told us to treat it as an expensive treat.  It is not all that expensive and just a little transforms broccoli, potatoes, chicken into a fancy taste treat.
6760;Good but little bitter;Compared to Starbucks Sumatra. This is pretty close.
6761;HFCS  = Wont be feeding this to my family;Go with Simply Heinz Ketchup not these packs its the best ketchup with real sugar. No poisons like HFCS.
6762;ALMOST AS GOOD AS MY FAVORITE INDIAN RESTAURANT!!;This has no meat in it--it is a curry paste/simmer sauce for your meat of choice. We had boneless pork chops on hand, so we diced the pork and used it instead of chicken.
6763;Gourmet;This glaze can be used in so many ways. We like it as an addition to a salad just drizzle it over the salad and enjoy.
6764;Very rich flavor;I am satisfied with this product.  It has a rich and full flavor.
6765;Delicious and very healthy;These are amazing little bars. Filling, yummy and all natural.
6766;Simply - It's terrible;If Keurig brewers were evaluated by this particular K-Cup, Keurig would be out of business. Wolfgang Puck - French Roast Melange Francais is inexcusably terrible coffee.
6767;This is not a cookie;If you are a health nut and really don't eat actual cookies, then I guess this would be a treat for you.  And God bless you that you maintain such a wholesome diet.
6768;Cat owner;I bought this product because of the ingredients . No grain , thinking this would be healthier for my multiple cats .
6769;Did not really take a liking to them;We bought the pack of 6 almost six months ago for our baby boy and we had to give most of them away
6770;spewing coffee grounds all over;these pods are defective . They spew coffee grounds all over the place and in the cup of coffee.
6771;Can't make them this good at home!!;"I'm very particular about what I feed my dogs. I often make my own ""canned/wet"" food and treats at home to ensure the quality and safety of the food I'm feeding my dogs."
6772;great flavor;Candy was harder than a gummi anything and was eaten day it was delivered. Flavor is terrific and it has a nice burn.
6773;Weak, wimpy, worthless;This tea is weak at best when compared to other rose hip teas I have tried. The bags have no string and tag.
6774;Maribisi is the best from Sienna;I am addicted to panforte, the traditional Tuscan Christmas fruit cake, I have even made Nick Malgieri's recipe at home with great success!<br />I have tried most of the brands on amazon, and when I can find it.<br />I find Maribisi is the top producer of panforte, their panfortes are loaded with Tuscan nuts and fruits and truly are the best quality.
6775;Perfect for our Pup;Our 5 month old Puppy loves this food.  We use the kibble as treats for training as well.
6776;Licorice for Licorice Lovers;My husband loves this licorice. We were able to fine it at our neighborhood grocery until recently.
6777;cheaper to buy this way;I'm on auto delivery for this item. I enjoy sugar free mints and it is around 1.
6778;High SUGARS !!!!!!;If I had review this by taste then I'd rate it a 4 star. From the nutrition facts I noticed that it has a considerable amount of sugars per serving which is like 20g.
6779;replaced coffee love it;exceptionally delicious, blends excellenct in my blender bottle, the bottle with the little round whisk. taste better than starbucks.
6780;A great all-purpose pepper;We go through a lot of pepper in our house so I was looking for a good pepper that didn't kill the budget and this one does it. They came fresh in an air tight bag, perfect for pepper mills.
6781;Cats love it!;I have one finicky cat and one food-hog cat. Both of them like this food.
6782;Good for Vegan Mac;Let me start by saying I'm not a vegan, I'm vegetarian. But recently I've been trying to incorporate mostly vegan foods into my diet (maybe someday soon I'll be full vegan).
6783;Worth it!;These were really a great find. I've been eating low carb for 3 months now and was missing having a noodle dish.
6784;Hold Your Breath Until Ready To Eat!;It's true. They smell when you open the package.
6785;Wonderful Tea!!!;I really enjoy this tea. It is a nice big cake and very well packaged.
6786;Best Spice in the World!;I have used this spice in the past and will continue to use it till I die.  I use it on just about everything
6787;Super Yummy!!;This is by far the yummiest maple syrup we have ever tried..
6788;Gluten-free!;There are a small number of companies that make gluten-free food, and they don't bother to talk about it.  These are, and as far as I can tell from reading the celiac boards, always have been gluten-free.
6789;My Cats Refuse To Eat It;My cats have rejected Tuna and Chicken Chuckles, but I'm only docking it one point for that because I don't think it is the food's fault. It looks just fine, mostly red tuna mixed with shreds of chicken, (there is way more tuna than chicken, the chicken shreds are almost like a condiment).
6790;Another hard-to-find item we love;Once again, Amazon has saved me some big headaches looking for my favorite products. I used to order this direct from the manufacturer, and they kept trying to sell me a case, which is WAY too much.
6791;An Absolute Favorite;These treats are my cat's favorite. They go nuts for it.
6792;A great meal-in-a-can soup;I have enjoyed this soup for years, and find it both very tasty and filling.<br /><br />In fact, when I have it for lunch (with just a couple of oat crakers), I don't need to eat anything else, so it's helping me to lose weight!<br /><br />I never feel weighed down by this soup, nor have the salt reaction that I have with saltier soups, but instead feel really well nourished.
6793;This is delicious crab meat!;I like to be able to just open a can to instantly make a crab meat salad.  Add mayo, lettuce, celery, and onions and this variety is delicious.
6794;great soymilk maker for the price;I've only tried making soymilk, and think the recipe I use may even come from an Amazon reviewer. Very simple: soak 1/3-1/2 cup of soybeans overnight in the fridge (or longer-- I've done this for up to 3 days, with a lid on), rinse and drain the beans and attach to the blade part, and fill the machine up to the top line with filtered water.
6795;The Best Between Doses;With the flu and cold season kicking into gear, I thought I'd give my opinion of the best cough drops on the market:  Halls Mentho-Lyptus.  When taking cold or flu medicine, everybody knows that the closer it gets to your next dose, coughs, throat irritation, and congestion get worse.
6796;Dried right?;I just checked with the Post Office here where I am stationed.  People can mail dried fruits and vegitables through the US Postal System.
6797;Same as in Store.;As far as I can tell this is the same item as you buy in the store.  All 24 items in pack were good (not damaged) and fresh.
6798;Pretty good;Aroma was awesome. As far as the taste goes, I definitely got the berry note.
6799;My least favorite;I bought several of the Kind bar flavors and these were the worst of the bunch. My son LOVES mango and macadamia, but this combination in the bar fell short of our expectations.
6800;Good Product, fast shipping;This cereal has been great for me as I've had to avoid sugar for about 6 weeks. The cereal is sweetened with brown rice syrup, and has a good rice taste to it.
6801;Such high hopes - dashed upon the rocks!;BACKGROUND:  I like coffee.  Especially a nice espresso drink.
6802;Better than homemade;"I have to praise these cookies to high heaven!  I used to do a lot of baking when I was younger so I remember what ""real"" shortbread cookies taste like.  I have given in to buying commercial shortbread for years, but when I tried these, they were absolutely like homemade, but even better."
6803;Birds love this food;The  insect are only in top layer of suet, but the birds love this stuff!  It attracts many different species.  A good source of protein during winter and when raising young.
6804;Works great, stopped her midnight screaming;My daughter was allergic to all other types of formula that we tried and did nothing but scream after feedings. She does not do well on the powdered version (she aspirates it) but the liquid does wonders.
6805;The Paw Hide is a great little toy.;Im out working in the daytime and feel real bad that my energetic pup is home bored to death! So finding this toy calmed my fear of doggy daytime boredom. It has seven (my favorite number) treat chambers that challenged my dog to lift each cup in order to reveal its prize!<br /><br />It is a must have when teaching the basics of eating obedience/command.
6806;I really wanted to like them;Considering I am a huge dark chocolate fan--and I don't mean the Hershey's dark chocolate. I typically like to eat chocolate with 65-70%  cocoa content, and was excited to see the dark chocolate cookies.
6807;"I have had better ""Jalapeno Kettle Chips""";These were nasty, they were so greasy and too rich for my blood, plus they lacked major flavor, no spicy jalapeno flavor at all.  I was so dissapointed in these chips, I am always hearing great things about these chips but I am telling you, yuck yuck yuck.
6808;Fantastic Food for Good Cat Health;The pet food industry can be one of the most infuriating as you start doing research and discovering what trash manufacturers (and the vets who get paid off by the manufacturers) push onto the unsuspecting public. For reference, don't ask your vet - do some Internet research at sites like, for example, [.
6809;An excellent Sardine;This is indeed in the top tier of sardines.  Very tasty, nicely packed, and go down sooooo smooth.
6810;Not too good to be true!;"My cousin sent me home with a sample packet of this stuff (I was having problems losing weight and my battle with sugar was severely hindering my goals). I remember thanking her and thinking about her words of ""It has no after-taste AND is all-natural"", I thought ""YEAH, right!"" and didn't try it until about 3 months later."
6811;GREAT TASTING!;This is the only canned shrimp I have ever tasted that did not have that funny metal aftertaste from being canned. I will be buying this over and over.
6812;Mother Hubbard - best natural dog biscuit!;I have given all of my dogs Mother Hubbard dog biscuits over the past 20 years.  It is natural and healthy and my dogs love them.
6813;Low fat treats - my dog LOVES;My vet said that my Golden Retriever was about 20 lbs. overweight.
6814;Fun way to give treats;My dog enjoyed getting her treats from this toy.  I had watched some videos of dogs playing with the star before I purchased it and those dogs were pushing the star around with their paw.
6815;Best Aspartame-free gum;This is really the best aspartame-free gum that's out there.  It tastes good.
6816;Salty and vinegary!!!;These are the strongest tasting salt and vinegar chips I've had.  I could still do with more vinegar flavor, but I think this is as close as I'm going to get without dousing them with vinegar powder myself.
6817;If you want a good cup of coffee...;Jet fuel sounds like it would be a strong cup od coffee and it is. It's also smooth and rich and altogether satisfying.
6818;Great sauce for meat and fish;This is an excellent sauce for my fish. It has so much delicious flavor
6819;Ewwwww!;My husband and i purchased this tea, he loves sangria and fruit teas but this just tastes terrible. Like moldy stale fruit in our opinion.
6820;Organic, delicious, and fair trade. Can't ask much more of a chocolate!;Loved it. It's maybe the best white chocolate I've tried.
6821;Disappointing;After reading the reviews, this sounded like a cool idea!  Sounded like, doesn't make it so.  They were sloppy and water/coffee dribbled out all over.
6822;Torani Syrup, French Vanilla;Great aroma and flavor. Fantastic coffee flavoring! I alternate with other Torani syrups such as caramel and hazelnut.
6823;NOT long lasting;I was very disappointed by the product.  They are NOT long lasting as I was lead to believe.
6824;I wasn't a big coffee drinker until I tried this. Now I'm hooked;I wasn't much of a coffee drinker before. Once in awhile I'd go to Starbucks to get an iced coffee but that was probably once a month and for awhile not having any coffee at all for a year.
6825;Perfect for small dogs.;I have tried many brands of rawhide in various sizes. I have two 8-pound dogs with small mouths, and these are the only rawhide sticks that they can chew in a reasonable amount of time.
6826;night and day difference;I breastfed my daughter for her first month of life, but she had severe problems with gas, bloating, and constipation.  We switched to a milk based formula, but the problem continued.
6827;Perfect little snack for baby;"Our first box was given to use by friends with a baby 8 months older than ours shortly after our baby was born.  ""He's going to love these one day!""  Sure enough, as soon as my son was old enough to eat solids, we found out the awesomeness of the Mum-Mum."
6828;BEST honey I've ever gotten mail order!;I'm picky about my honey, and most is too bland (blended) to impress me.  I don't require a honey to be a specific variety, but it should represent some good variety well.
6829;"Hot ""Chocolate""?";This item, though a cute idea, really doesn't live up to its title. The pink is fun, especially if you use a glass mug to see the whole drink.
6830;A Wonder for Aching Muscles!;I have used this product for years and I love it!  I used to run marathons and nothing could touch the aches I would encounter during my training and after my races like this soak.  I don't run anymore due to a severe back injury, but I've used it during my recovery and use it now just to take the edge off of everyday backaches.
6831;Good dressing, expired;I cannot find this salad dressing in my area anymore, I have ordered 2 times on Amazon and it must be ordered in a case of 6 bottles, which is fine, however when it arrives all of the bottles have the same expired date. I ordered this in Dec.
6832;Licorette Licorice;We like these Sugar Free Licorice candies. They are small and strong with good licroice flavor.
6833;great green tea;I do not usually like green tea but I drink it for the health benefits. This is the first one I like for the flavor.
6834;Yummy!;These were wonderful. I don't know how they make these so crunchy and airy at the same time.
6835;Dented Cans are an Issue;This product is okay.  The cans seem to be made of a thinner metal than other brands (8 of 12 were delivered dented).
6836;Great price, I use it everyday!;This was a great price.<br />I use this every night for a snack before bed.
6837;My Cats Dig This.;My cats totally dig this food. They gobble it up with no issue and wait for more.
6838;Poor packaging;When the candies arrived all of the package seams had failed.  I had to repackage the candies in zip-lock bags to preserve them.
6839;Great For Sending to Armed Forces Overseas!!;Hi All,<br /><br />I am a volunteer for a local organization, here in San Diego County, that sends packages of personal care items and condiments to our brave men and women in Afghanistan. We do it about every two months.
6840;Chocolate mint tea;This tea arrived on time and is the second time I have bought it.  It is ok but not exactly what I had hoped for, a sweeter tea.
6841;This thing really, really works!;I want to express my profound thanks to the many Amazon reviewers who helped me find and decide to purchase this product.  The positive reviews are stunningly correct.
6842;simply beautiful masal dabba;I was generally pleased with the quality of this product. I did not realize the individual spice containers had no lids of their own but that was not a show stopper.
6843;twinings english breakfast tea;This is a wonderful tea for the keurig machines.  If you like a tea with no bitter taste then this is the one for you.
6844;Best Red Curry Paste;This paste is infinitely better than the Thai Kitchen brand that you can buy in the stores. Its a LOT less expensive, and a little goes a long way.
6845;Best Chocolate Waffle I've found;This is an all inclusive mix, just add water and wait 15m to use.  The make a wonderful Belgian Waffle (have not tried pancakes).
6846;Wrong bottle type;Although the quantity of soy sauce is the same, the bottle that I received was a restaurant-style table dispenser, not a bottle that can be closed. Because this will cause evaporation in my desert climate, the soy sauce must be transferred to another container.
6847;better than I imagined!;I have read that Community Coffee is good and beloved around New Orleans. I'm a regular Kona and Blue Mountain drinker so I had tempered expectations but boy I was pleasantly surprised.
6848;Outstanding value for the BEST dark chocolate!;I have had the oppoertunity to try this chocolate before, but I could not find it any of my local stores. Most stores carry the milk chocolate and the white chocolate versions of this confection but not the dark.
6849;The best coconut coffee yet!;This coffee is great. The taste is perfect.
6850;yck - flavor of meat isn't good;I'm having to mix this with other soups and eat it with toast just to make it edible. The only issue I have with it is the meat - I'm not liking the flavor of it, or the flavor it imparts on the soup.
6851;My favorite canned refried beans;Love these, and it's SO HARD to find lower-sodium products that still taste good. Now if I can just get Garden of Eatin to stop over-salting my favorite tortilla chips.
6852;Best chips ever;The title says it all. Great flavor, hint of spice, excellent crunch.
6853;Very Convenient;These are the flavors that our cat prefers.  Our cat, probably like yours, too, has very evident preferences in her food.
6854;delicious!;I use the Black bean & lime soup for a quick meal at home for the family. I'll have some plain black beans with onion cooking in a crock pot and before the meal I'll pour one container of the Black bean soup/with seasoning into the crockpot to cook for 10 or 15 minutes.
6855;Tastes great but didn't digest well.;I do not do well with any product that contains sugar alcohols. Based on what I'd read about palm sugar, I don't think it's a sugar alcohol, but my body sure acted like I had ingested sugar alcohols.
6856;my tea;Enjoyable tea with a refreshing taste.  The 16-count Pack of 6 represents an excellent buy compared to store prices.
6857;Can't Go Wrong;Can't go wrong with the clean energy of 5-Hour. It's our caffeine boost of choice.
6858;Best Dog Treats;These liver chunks are like crack for dogs. The niblets are magic for training dogs because the critters will do anything for these.
6859;Great strong tea;I have been drinking this tea with my lunch at work to give me a kick for the rest of the work day.  It is definitely a nice everyday treat.
6860;On time and as described!!;I was very happy with my order.  It arrived on time and as described.
6861;Best Pretzels!;My husband and I were looking for a good snack and these fit the bill for us. More fiber than your normal pretzel, lots of flavor and has a decent amount of protein too.
6862;No effect on anyone in our family;I was quite excited to try this product, so I bought 4 packs. We opened one, and I tested a half-tablet.
6863;Great item for a great price;This is a quality product for a great price.  Hempseeds are a great way to get omega 3's and digestible protein in your diet daily.
6864;Cat Grass;Our cats love the grass.  It's easy to grow and it sprouts within a few days so you have an ample supply on hand continually.
6865;I was not disappointed with Quaker Oatmeal Squares!;"Quaker Oatmeal Squares, Crunchy Oatmeal Cereal with a Hint of Brown Sugar<br /><br />46 grams of whole grains per serving, 210 calories, 190mg sodium, 9g sugars -- plus, ""As part of a heart healthy diet, the soluble fiber in Oatmeal helps reduce cholesterol!"" .."
6866;Sno-cap Candies;Chocolate seemed old.  It was powdery on edges and some areas of surface.
6867;"The ""revitalizing"" has more to do with the caffeine than with the herbs!";My taste of Yogi Teas has been limited to the herbals.  I do enjoy a strong cup of tea and was surprised Yogi made this.
6868;Great decaf to allow you the satisfaction of drinking coffee without the caffeine!;As my wife and I got older we had to reduce our caffeine consumption.  Our little self-indulgence is to mix 3 portions of caffeine free coffee with 1 portion of regular roast coffee for our morning breakfast.
6869;This is the one!;"We have tried several different Laksa Pastes and this is the ""Real Deal"".  Look no further you've found the right stuff with this paste."
6870;Low calorie, high protein, great taste;I really like this protein drink. I'm pregnant and trying to increase protein in my diet without adding a whole lot of extra calories or fat.
6871;shipping cost high, product excellent;Received 24 packets of cat food - quantity was unclear in advertising.<br />The packaging protected against damage as if the packets were crystal glassware.
6872;Gloria Jean's Butter Toffee!!;Excellent coffee and fills my need for the decadence of toffee!!! I love my Keurig coffee maker for the ability to have so many selections at hand..
6873;Worth the money.;This is a great tea to keep with you and re-steep during the day. The taste is fresh and fine, and it has a hint of taro flavor.
6874;Pleased with this;After trying Sanka, Cafix, and one other I can't even remember, I found Pero. I'd been a coffee drinker for quite a few years, but wanted to get away from it.
6875;beware of this seller!!! (Halaleveryday);i ordered certified organic raw cacao powder. i recieved non organic CAROB powder.
6876;Flavorful, strong, excellent;I have tried many flavors of the K-Cups since purchasing my machine a month ago.  Day in and day out I reach for the Extra Bold Dark Magic.
6877;Best hot sauce on the planet;Not too spicey but full of great flavor 'tio goes on everything. But it can also be hard to find at a reasonable price, so that is where amazon comes in.
6878;Good taste and texture;Very pleased with these. They had both a good taste and texture.
6879;Lives up to the Starbucks name;"If you don't believe the words ""quality"" and ""instant"" belong in the same sentence, get ready for a surprise. The best cup of instant coffee I've ever had."
6880;Great product at an excellent price;This is SO MUCH cheaper than any other gelatin I have ever seen (especially grocery store gelatin which is just ridiculous). I use it to make fondant (dough like cake icing) and it works just as great as the name brand.
6881;A puppy pleaser for sure............;Our 10 year old mixed breed loves these treats.  She begins performing her tricks without any prompting when she sees I have the bag.
6882;Found Elsewhere;I didn't purchase this product because of the reviews.  So I went searching and found it at:  olivenation.
6883;Love it!!;t's expensive, that's for sure -- but well worth it. My feral cats have many health problems, so it's important they eat well.
6884;Very GOOOD!!!!;These lollipops are so good! They are not too sweet and not too sour. Yet they have powerful flavors.
6885;Delicious!;To preface this review, I have to admit that I'm considered an unconventional cook by my family. For example, when I make my own special pasta sauce, I like to infuse it with spices and chili.
6886;Some really great and some really really bad;Diet Cranberry Raspberry - The BEST flavor I've tried yet. It's just sweet enough, great flavor, and calorie free.
6887;They were perfect for our anual CRABFEST!!!;They were exactly what we thought we were ordering. They were also shipped to us very quickly.
6888;Just ok.;It was ok. I tried a Thai ice tea that was great and spicey.
6889;Dense Texture, Wheat Taste;The above title pretty much says almost all I need to say about this product:  It has a dense texture and a wheat taste.  By itself the flavor is good but not 'yummy':  I would add some oil to the crust, both to the top and the bottom, to give it a little more flavor.
6890;Bummer plastic container!;Bummer! Plastic! However, I can't wait to use it in my hair and skin..
6891;yummmmmy....that's me picking it out of my teeth...mmmmm;This candy is the best ginger chew I have ever eaten. They are insanely addictive.
6892;Safe and healthful, and my choice of 'new' cat food to switch to;My cats are extremely fussy, one more than the other.  The more agreeable kitty was happy to switch to PetGuard.
6893;Wellnes Dry Dog Food;Good quality and our dogs will eat it.  Many dry dog foods they just turn their noses up to.
6894;Avoid Dove Men+Care Body Wash!;I barely get acne on my body. It does happen on my face occasionally.
6895;Kashi 7 Whole Grain Puffs Cereal;I got started on this cereal years ago. I did not like the newer Kashi cereals as well.
6896;Excellent;Great jam, just like we were back in Hawaii. Cost less with shipping than if we bought it there.
6897;good stuff!;This product works very well. It taste great.
6898;Ewwwww!!!!;Really?  Who blends this stuff and decides that it is good?  Ugh.  I can sum this nastyness up in one quick phrase.
6899;My dog loves 'em!;My basset/beagle mix breed is a heavy chewer (he once chewed through a Kong, no lie) and regular rawhides don't last long, but it takes him a day or two to get through one of these. He loves them and they keep him busy and they don't stain the bedding or the rugs.
6900;Delicious;I love these bars. I love that they are raw and healthy for me.
6901;Organic (mostly) and Delicious!!;I use a lot of boullion.  Until I found these little cubes of goodness, I used Better than Boullion, mostly chicken flavored which is great but I'm not so in love with some of the ingredients even though I use the organic version.
6902;Better than expected;The product was better than expected and it arrived quickly. I am very pleased with this purchase.
6903;Fast;Arrived about a week sooner than expected.  They are so fast they even go right through your system.
6904;A 4 Week Wine Very  Drinkable in 6 Weeks;This wine was easy to make and it was ready within the sixth week. I take a few extra weeks for clearing of the wine and in the end it's pretty drinkable in three months can't waite untill a year.
6905;Great for my finicky eaters;My 2 and 4 yr old drink these in the car.  It's a great snack for toddlers on the go with all the vitamins and minerals of fruit and veggies.
6906;Great taste and good nutrition;I feed both my kids Earth's Best brand baby/toddler food when I am unable to prepare food myself.  All flavors have a short list of ingredients, good flavor and a nice nutrition profile.
6907;Can't live without it!;This product is amazing!  Caffine is not normally a stimulant for me.  I can drink a pot of coffee and go right to sleep due to a sleep disorder.
6908;good syrups;These syrups are great for slushes. My kids love them and they are great for summer parties.
6909;Good Low Carb Filler;"I admit when I first open these noodles the smell is a bit fishy.  I don't like fishy whatsoever, so I was relieved when I found a warm water rinse cures the noodles of their ""BO""."
6910;Flavoring tastes odd;Let me start with that I'm a heavy coffee drinker, primarily flavored coffees.  Vanilla is one of my favorites, normally.
6911;A 25 calorie treat;Swiss Miss Diet is a terrific little 25 calorie treat (or in my case, 50 calories since I use a 16 oz mug) when you just need to have something chocolatey but don't want to spend the calories on some actual chocolate.  For those who complained about the way it dissolves, after adding the powder to your cup, pour in about one quarter cup of boiling water and stir briskly until all the clumps are dissolved.
6912;Too much sugar;Crispy, light, but overloaded with sugar.Sweeter then any GF product I have tried!!!  The price is one the high side, but Amazon has a good deal.
6913;All 3 cats say NO!;I bought this food because of the review that said it was more meaty than the duck and green pea, which was a loser for us because it was so pasty.  I was disappointed to find that this one was the same as the duck as far as texture goes.
6914;Taste Pow!;I've tasted several brands of yuzu kosho and this one is very, very good.  The texture is more pasty and thicker than other ones available from Japan.
6915;"Yum - But not ""OMG YUM""";"We use this in our espresso maker and it makes a good latte, but I thought I'd be blown away by the ""crema"" part of the taste. Just tastes like a normal homemade espresso - nothing different than when we make it with Starbucks or whatnot."
6916;Love the flavor;My mom and son love the flavor of this hot chocolate. Add a little bit of milk afterwards and 1 splenda and the taste is amazing.
6917;Vinegar with a kick!;My german potato salads have not been tasting the same as my Oma's (grandmother's) and I knew it had to be the vinegar.  I had a german potato salad recently that was fantastic and the woman who made it used this vinegar, which she buys whenever she is at a PX.
6918;smooth and delishious!;I made my mouse with this instead of Hershey's special dark cocoa, it mixed more smoothly and the mouse was great.  It was not as dark as the Hershey's in-between the regular cocoa that I make milk chocolate mouse with and the special dark chocolate that I make the dark mouse with.
6919;not worth it :(;I recently purchased two boxes of twinkies from American to be sent to Australia.<br />Firstly they did not arrive within the time frame that was given to me (6 days after maximum date), even though I paid for express post.
6920;My dog goes crazy for this treat!!!;My dog loves it and goes crazy for it! Also, other dogs (I was visiting my parent-in-law) went crazy for this treat. However, I must say this treat stinks so bad.
6921;Mentos Gum is Yum!;I've been a big fan of Mentos for many years, love the flavor.  Mentos Gum has a really great flavor.
6922;Aromatic, beautiful, and tasty;Several years ago I would buy this product at Trader Joe's. They no longer carry it.
6923;Mickey Mouse edible decorations;These are hard to find and came in record time.<br />Very happy with them.
6924;Good - but there is better;If you're like me - you're reading the reviews on all the maple syrups available on amazon..
6925;Delicious.;With a lot of flavored coffee I find that the smell is better than the taste and that after a few sips I'm very tired of the flavor.  Not so with this coffee.
6926;Good Chew;I love that these chews aren't artificially flavored and colored and don't have any of those odd animal body parts (pig ear, cow toe whatever) that are kind of repulsive to think about. Even better, shaggy dog seems to like them, too.
6927;Taste great. Just love them.;I read that almonds help to lose weight. Eat a handful a day.
6928;Excellent;This stuff is excellent.  I usually only buy Jack's Links so this was taking a risk and it was definitely worth it.
6929;Way overpriced!;Love this product. It's quick and easy if you eat vegan or raw.
6930;If you want fiber, don't buy!;I specifically ordered these chips because the nutrition information states they have 4 grams of fiber per serving. They taste good, so I ordered the case from Amazon.
6931;It was exactly what i wanted;I was extremely happy with this item.I received it in a speedy fashion and it was exactly what i was expecting.
6932;fun for him... not for me!;"my 14 week old puppy LOVES the buster cube. I ordered the large one and had NO problem with the instructions and also found the ""difficult setting"" too easy for my shepherd/jindo mix."
6933;I Got It The Next Day!;I Got It The Next Day! I ordered friday got it saturday. I didn't even pay for next day delivery.
6934;My son LOVES this!;I have trouble getting my 7 month old to eat any green veggies.  I was skeptical after reading some of the other reviews for this product but I decided to give it a try anyway.
6935;Inexpensive But Still Healthful;I have 4 cats, so I can't afford to splurge on their food.  And sometimes they don't all like one product, and that doesn't work for me.
6936;My Cavalier Loves This Stuff!;My small Cavalier King Charles Spaniel (81/2 months old & only 8 lbs.) loves this food!  Anything else, she turns her nose up at (she's picky, too!).
6937;My Cats go GA-GA for these Treats!;I have 2 older cats (about 13 years old).  They are both absolutely crazy about these treats (even the picky one)!.
6938;I don't know what all the fuss is about.;These are ok. The best way to describe the taste is that they taste exactly like pepsi cola that's gone flat.
6939;What happened?;This is my fourth order of these pork rinds and I'm not sure what's up, but something's really amiss.  The bags are leaking some kind of grease and don't fluff up during the microwave process.
6940;OK for what it is;If you want a water enhancer, with no calories, and with some energy and vitamin ingredients, this is fine. The fruit punch flavor I tried tasted pretty good, with no bad after taste, though it did taste a bit artificial to me.
6941;Good Product- VERY Slow Super Saver Shipping;My dogs LOVE this product. They beg for them.
6942;Great!;This is my favorite instant noodle so yummy. I always boil it as whenever I microwave it, it tends to come out too undercooked.
6943;Great for Breakfast or snack;We normally buy these at Costco and I think they are a little cheaper (maybe a couple of bucks) although the banana walnut bars come packaged WITH the chocolate chip bars so it's sadly double money..
6944;The absolute best granola!!;I'm kind of so-so when it comes to granola. Don't really care for it as a cereal or snack, but do enjoy it mixed into ice cream.
6945;Dim Chocolate;I have an absolute passion for deep, dark hot chocolate. I want chocolate which tastes like *chocolate*, rich and flavorful, with a hint of a bite.
6946;The One and Only;I discovered this product while living in the Philippines with my wife. I was so glad to be able to find it back home in the United States in local Asian grocery stores (first in California, then on the East Coast and online).
6947;Delicious!;This is the one and only marinade that I can say is 100% satisfactory (thus far), I first used this 3.5 years ago.
6948;Healthy Snack;I couldn't find any ingredients listed on the product's description page and, because I don't eat gluten, I was hoping that these might be made with oats *instead* of wheat.  No such luck.
6949;Yuck!;I was so excited when ordering these.  They sounded so great and had high hopes.
6950;Breakfast links - mmmmm;this product is good quality just like their hog casings. The only drawback is these are harder to thread on the stuffer due to the smaller size.
6951;Chicklets;Arrived on time.  Reminds me from when I was a child.
6952;Wonderful taste;I love dual flavors.  I just love flavors and am always looking for ways to make something I already like more flavorful.
6953;If Mom says it's good...;I purchased this Tea for my mom because she can't have caffiene.  I chose this brand because I was tired of looking, my Moom loves it and trust me she knows her Tea.
6954;Yummy Goodness;This jerky is my favorite snack treat.  I buy it in quantities of ten packages at a time because it goes that fast.
6955;My favorite blend;After being assaulted by very strong blends, I finally found a coffee that I like. It has a nice aroma and taste.
6956;perfect food for my old dog :);Our cocker spaniel is now nearly 10 years old, and the solid gold food I'd been feeding him suddenly changed its formulation over a year ago(with no notice on the packaging), and he became subject to unexplained stomach upsets. After the contaminated food scare even tho Solid Gold was not recalled, I decided to switch, and this formulation is perfect for him to not gain too much weight.
6957;delicious - soothing;tried first in Fla.  could not find a vendor in Atlanta.
6958;Great nad Healthy;I was really surprised how great these tasted and i couldn't put them down. These make great snacks for just about any occasion and i highly recommend them.
6959;Japanese Style Noodles (Sapporo Ichiban);These aren't bad noodles, but they're certainly not the greatest. In all honesty, they taste almost exactly like Maruchan's beef flavoured noodles, but a tad bit better.
6960;JARS LEAKED!;4 of the 6 jars leaked, causing a big mess. I had to throw them out to be safe.
6961;Awesome;Awesome taste. Awesome product.
6962;Really nice flavor!;First of all, these are 1 cup pods.  It does not make a full pot.
6963;Great taste, high price;Starbucks must think their coffee is made of gold.  A much higher price, and only 16 in a box.
6964;dogs dont like them;I tried on three different occasions to get my two dogs to try these biscuits.  They just sniffed and turned away, both of them.
6965;An Excellent Compromise;This popcorn is an excellent middle ground between popcorn with alot of butter & the<br />popcorn that is 94% [or more] reduced fat/butter & as a result is really way too dry! The taste has just enough flavor but not overly oily, etc. Sometimes we actually mix a light butter or movie theater butter flavor with this 50% less fat version & it results in all around very tasty popcorn.
6966;"For those with ""higher standard"" tastes will find this satisfying.";"GoPicnic Ready-to-eat Meals (Salmon & Crackers) is a on-the-go meal for those with slightly deeper pockets and with a more ""refined"" taste than your average Joe lunch pail.  The Salmon & Crackers were okay, the Dark Chocolate treat with really delicious, the Edamames were okay and the Ginger Zip fruit & nut mix wasn't that bad."
6967;The BEST flavor EVER;I no longer buy any other flavors of ramen.  This one is phenomenal.
6968;Great snack for toddler;This is a great snack for my 2.5 year old son.
6969;Super healthy & guilt-free snacking;"I've seen the KIND brand bars in stores but never had the chance to try their granola.  As you can see in the description, there's a plethora of ""good for you"" grains, such as amaranth, quinoa (grain of the Incas that is loaded with amino acids and fiber), oats, millet and buckwheat."
6970;Finally;I have sensitive skin so cleansing my face has always been a factor I've always used alba products body washes are great oils are great so why wouldn't I try this well I'm so glad I did because it evens your tone,cleans and smell great all at the same time. It smells like lemons or some type of citrus and I've start letting my 15 yr use it and no more acne she loves it.
6971;tasted like 10 year old gum;Very quick delivery of very stale gum.  I threw it out it was so bad.
6972;Chamomile tea - the natural sleep aid.;Chamomile Tea is the only non narcotic sleep aid that has worked for my daughter. It relaxes her to the point where she is able to fall asleep (without drugs) and sleep soundly through the night.
6973;Classic Condiment;Mae Ploy Sweet Chili Sauce is becoming a standard condiment on my dinner table. It has just the right blend of sweet and heat
6974;My german grandma had one of these and I just fell in love!;I just love this coffee maker.  The taste is better and it is so beautiful.
6975;Lots of grinds;For some reason, I keep getting grinds with these K-Cups. I haven't had a problem with anything else in my Keurig.
6976;Good stuff, but...;"My two bags were kind of ""sweaty"". The powder and the sour patch kids all appeared to have gotten wet at some point."
6977;I'm not much on the flavor, but our dog loves it.;Our vet had just recommended trying Beneful for our older dog's weight control.  I have no idea yet how that will work, but the dog simply loves it.
6978;Nice looking topiary;Im not crazy about artificial plants, but at a weekend home you don't have a lot of options. This topiary fits the bill by adding a touch of green without being cheesy.
6979;Quite possibly.....the BEST?;I got addicted to Werthers Original Hard Candies years ago. The unique flavor became a favorite during long hikes in the mountains, and years of working in the desert.
6980;GREAT TASTING CHIPS;This is the second purchase of Kettle Potato Chips and we love them just as much as the first time we tried them. We bought them by the a carton of 24 bags.
6981;awesome;I just got my Swanson cert organic extra virgin coconut oil and loved it right away. I used it as a body moisturizer and gave my honey a body massage with it too, and he loved it better than his other massage product.
6982;addicted to these chips!;they don't look very appetizing, but oh my are they good!  very tasty.  i looked up the company and they are an environmentally friendly company.
6983;Acquired a taste, now I love these;The first time I tasted Cacao Nibs I thought they were very strange. But, after seeing on Doctor Oz that these are healthy and may help boost metabolism, I tried them again.
6984;Can taste the sugar but not the nuts;This cereal is tasty, but it's mostly sugary not nutty and there is a bit of an aftertaste to it.  The actual cereal doesn't look like on the box with lots of nuts on each piece.
6985;Great Snack;I love nuts and dark chocolate, so for me this was a no brainer. These aren't big enough for a meal replacement for me personally, but for some dieting or trying to do whats right and eat a breakfast in a hurry these are a great option.
6986;Not what you expect!;The product currently advertised on Amazon is no longer made by Chatfield's.  You will not receive grain sweetened chips if that's what you are looking for!  The chips you will receive are sugar sweetened and are sickeningly sweet!  In addition, in the recipe where I used them in a chocolate/carob topping, heated and mixed with milk, they stayed gooey instead of hardening like other chocolate or carob chips I had used.
6987;Loved it!;I live in the Middle east, so I try to do alot of research into a product before buying it. I was very happy with the wilton chocolate and it was a breeze to use it.
6988;Vitality Mini Chicken treats;My dogs love these and they are small enough that I don't feel guilty giving them more than one per day. The only problem is I can't find them in stores so I am stuck with the high rising costs.
6989;great product, great price;This is a good tasting gluten free pasta for a great price.  My whole family enjoys it, even those not on a gf diet.
6990;Great taste! But... packaging needs rework?;Petite Cuisine Grilled Tuna Treats / B004867T24<br /><br />My cats don't like treats, so I'm always on this constant search to find treats that maybe they *will* like. And then I'll teach them to do the tango, or something -- I'm hazy on that part.
6991;My Kids Devour These Cookies;"""Oreos"" are America's favorite cookie. Frankly, I've never understood the fascination."
6992;Addictive. . . .;I first purchased a package of these dried cranberries just a few weeks ago (after having just enjoyed cranberries in the salad at a restaurant). It has rapidly become a staple in the family diet.
6993;Wow Diabeetus;These are seriously too sweet to even handle, they are sweeter than anything I have tried. They resemble chocolate cake doubled over with sugar.
6994;Repulsive!;These look, smell, and taste vile.  I try each food first before I give it to my baby and have been very happy with all of the Earth's Best varieties we've tried so far.
6995;Meet the best K-Cups yet!!;Having tried alot of the K-Cups now on the market..
6996;There is nothing like this;Carte Noire is simply the best French coffee from France you can buy on line: It is every thing the French like in coffee: dark, rich and cheap.  Unlike the American coffee medium roast, it the best dark-medium roast you can buy.
6997;5 STARS FOR THIS STARBUCKS;We've long been fans of Starbucks  coffees, but this is undoubtedly now our top favorite.<br /><br />  The coffee, of course, is the usual Starbucks quality -  tops.
6998;O.M.G... So Very Delicious!!;This is absolutely DELICIOUS!! Wow! I eat it with (also delicious!!) Annie Chuns Sticky Rice : http://www.amazon.
6999;Best Chips ever;I love these chips.  They are crunchy and they don't crumble in to little pieces in the bag.
7000;Like the shampoo . . .;. .
7001;The only food Omar eats;Omar, the 18-year old diabetic tomcat who is the love of my life, has no front teeth and this is the only thing he'll eat besides treats. Even though it's a bit more expensive - I can never find more than 3-4 cans at the grocery, so, with Amazon Prime, this really saves me time.
7002;risorto rice;the product shipped to me in great time, and the rice is so delicious, I have already made 3 pots of different types of risorto. I would absolutely purchase when I run out.
7003;Great for diabetics;Being a type 1 diabetic I can't have the regular energy drinks with the insane amount of sugar and carbs, and for a while I've been trying to find a diet alternative that works and I've finally found it with these Zero Carb Rockstars. It doesn't impact my blood sugar, it tastes good, and wakes me up like an energy drink should plus these 24 packs save me a ton of time and money.
7004;Future of Food;Much food that is utterly worthless can be, given some diligence, reinvented in a usable form. This is a good example.
7005;A bit pricy, but YUMMY!!;I found these at our local Costco, tried them and loved them.  The next time I went back for more, they didn't varry them anymore.
7006;I'm unqualified to judge this, but it looks high quality;"This is supposed to be real cinnamon, which is totally unlike the plant we usually use in the US for cinnamon, which is closely related taste wise, but is not cinnamon.  It has a more earthly smell and taste, and isn't as strong as Vietnam ""cinnamon"", which really isn't cinnamon."
7007;great;I got this the day I expected to and the dog LOVES it. Overall very happy with my purchase and would buy again.
7008;The Cat likes it, too!;I was using Castor and Pollux from Amazon for my dog and I decided to try something different.  My dog dug into this dog food right away!  It has helped to maintain her rough coat so that it is softer and smoother.
7009;Value;I love the taste of this coffee.  It does not have a bitter taste and the size of the can, which per ounce is the same as if you bought the large can, keeps it fresher as a smaller amount is exposed to the air.
7010;Cardboard;In general I like Walker's products. I tried to avoid ordering cookies this year and try the oatcakes.
7011;Yummy chips!;My son and I agree. These are fine flavored potato chips! The Kettle brand has a lot of interesting variations on flavoring.
7012;Diarrhea and such.;Hmm. I don't doubt these ingredients are good! But my cats don't love this and one of them only eats the 'gravy' part and ends up with really bad diarrhea.
7013;Tasty Comfort Food;A pouch of Velveeta cheese sauce differentiates this dinner from the usual skillet dinner. Added after the meal is cooked, the sauce does make for a saucy and tasty dish.
7014;Best I've Found;Tried different brand from local candy store. It was awful!  This has good strong horehound flavor without being bitter.
7015;Vanilla Stevia;It is sweet and zero calories and good for you and your coffee. What more could you ask for? The delivery was fast and the price was reasonable.
7016;High protein snack;Finally, a high protein snack which really is just that- high protein, without excess fat or carbohydrate. VERY good for almost any diet, but especially for a low carb OR low fat diet.
7017;What are you looking for?;On first bite, I found this granola to lack much sweetness.  Then again, I am comparing it to those sugary cereals that people who are looking into this product are probably trying to avoid.
7018;This is real fast food;Just heat and eat. So easy and tastes great with low sodium content.
7019;Purchased a bag with way too much salt - Company provided a replacement: almonds were perfect;Original review -- I thought I had purchased salt with almonds in it. The amount of salt is RIDICULOUS and very unhealthy.
7020;You'll go bananas;I love having a Larabar for breakfast each day. The banana bread flavor is delicious and full of healthy fruit and nuts, but after eating the whole pack, I was a little tired of it.
7021;This seller is overpriced;I buy EB from Whole Food's for $25.99.
7022;gotta get some.....;one of the better tasting seasonings they make. Not too salty and very limey.
7023;Gassy and loose stool after 1-2 weeks?;My 4 month old American Eskimo started eating this brand about two weeks ago and in the last several days I've noticed her stool very loose and smelly. Not only that, she farts! She does like the food.
7024;Ginger spice is so nice, they added it thrice;This is my abs-fave (absolute favorite) Ginger cookie. I am so impressed with Amazon grocery for carrying this product.
7025;Beef Base;Very good to use to add beef flavor to food. Have given this product to family and friends to introduce them to it.
7026;Not for chewers;I Initially liked it but when left alone with my dog, her chewed thru the rope and plunger rendereing it useless. Lasted less then a week with my destroyer of a dog.
7027;Nice Coffee, Pods Didn't Work for Us;I really love the idea of this coffee from the family of Bob Marley. However, it's packaged in individual pods that work in a Keurig adapter cup, so if you don't have that kind of coffee maker/adapter, this product isn't for you.
7028;The best for the price;A Kind bar with an apple makes a filling work lunch. The bars are different than most I've tried in that they are made to be eaten slowly.
7029;viperron;I've been using this product for about 2 years to treat skipped heart beats which I have suffered with for about 4 decades with zero help from the medical community. It has been one of the only supplements I've tried in that same period that has lived up to it's promises.
7030;My Pugs Love Them;Our black pug eats anything, so using him to decide whether or not a new treat is good is not wise.  To him, everything is good.
7031;If you like olives you will love these;Olives in a jar are hard to find if you want an olive antipasto.  at the deli you wind up paying $3 for a small plastic tub.
7032;yummy!;I am a fan of Larabars in general, and this is a really good variety! I keep Larabars in my purse, etc. for breakfast, snacks, etc.
7033;If you're really committed to eating them, they're ok;"So, I'm trying to be a responsible parent.  I buy these and give my kids the ""It's these or nothing- no more pop-tarts"" speech."
7034;If you like Jerky it doesn't get any better than this,;"Buffalo Bills 8oz Teriyaki Beef Jerky<br /><br />I ordered Buffalo Bills 8oz Barbecue Country Cut Beef Jerky Pack and got a free sample of Buffalo Bills 8oz Teriyaki Beef Jerky with it.<br /><br />If Virgil had eaten this stuff it would be defined as ""the food of Gods""  If you like Jerky it doesn't get any better than this, at least I haven't eaten it."
7035;good stuff;This cereal is really good, a little less sugary than regular frosted corn flakes.  My grandson loves it.
7036;Crisp Texture, Somewhat Sharp Taste;In comparing this Fleur with Roland's Fleur from Île de R&eacute
7037;They should change the name.;I am not a big fan of this drink.  It says Apple flavor but it should say sour apple!!  It is very sour.
7038;Wonderful tea;
7039;Great on-the-go meal;I am a mom of 3 kids. My youngest is always on the go as we take her older siblings to their sports practices and games.
7040;Big really Big;Wish these came in a smaller size for my dogs (English Cockers).  Yep they can eat them but they almost make a full meal.
7041;Fantastic--so much better than cheesecloth!;"Good grief, I love this nut milk bag. It works infinitely better than any other product I've used for making nut milks, straining ""cheese"", etc."
7042;C H I P.....C H I P.....H O O R A Y....!!!!!  :  )  ( B A C K Y A R D.....B A R B E C U E );"I was getting VERY worried, when I read some of the other reviews here.  Specifically, the ""One Star"" reviews, to which I always go, to see if the faults these other reviewers find with any merchandise would prevent me from buying it."
7043;My cats love it!;It's great to find a grain free product that is actually appealing to my cats.  They are excited about food again.
7044;Definitely healthier than the norm;Has a lot less salt than the usual mixed nuts (thus it doesn't taste as good, but its better for you).<br /><br />Also has pistachios, which many other mixed nuts containters do not.
7045;These taste so bland.;Look, each pack contains two servings of 120 cal each, yet those servings serve up exactly zero taste.  They should make it one serving of the same number of calories but inject some taste.
7046;A little taste of childhood;"My brother calls these ""a poor man's butterfinger"". Ha! Nonsense! These taste awesome and remain one of my favorite candies."
7047;I would not be without my coconut oil.;I cook with it.  It tolerates heat better than olive oil.
7048;VERY Filling!;This hot cereal is one of the best I've had. You get 10g of protein & 8g of Fiber.
7049;A nice variety;We've tried just about all varieties of baby food made by Earth's Best, and this variety pack is one of our favorites.  Each of the meals is a nice combination of veggies and protein.
7050;Top Quality Dried Bing Cherries;Dried Bing Cherries are usually quite expensive to buy and can be overly dehydrated making them tasteless and like little rocks.<br />These ones were very reasonably priced and exceptionally tasty and moist.
7051;No description on Amazon product page;I have not yet tried this product so ignore the number of stars--- I saw no other way to make a commment which is..
7052;My favorite green tea!;This tea is more flavorful and less bitter than most green teas.  I steep it for a full 5 minutes without any bitterness.
7053;Decent;These have a great crunch and it's great that it's low fat. However, it's way too salty.
7054;Mmm... One of my all time favorite chocolate bars! :-P~;"For those of you not familiar, ""crunchie"" bars are solid honeycomb coated with a relatively thin layer of milk chocolate. Personally, I love 'em! They're one of my all time favorite chocolate bars."
7055;Tug-a-jug gets my dog's approval;I bought this for my one year old sheltie for Christmas and he LOVES it.  I put the Premier buddy berrys inside and they work quite well, as he can smell them through the holes in the toy.
7056;Too pricy;After receiving the Nido from Amazon and seeing the size of the containers I was able to find it in my local grocery for over $2.00 less per container and there was no shipping involved.
7057;Best tomato soup I've had.;"Last week, ""The Hungry Girl"" (from the Food Network) was on Good Morning America and claimed this was ""The best soup ever! Ever! Ever!"". I am not a big fan of Campbell's Tomato soup, but have enjoyed the various Progresso Tomato soups."
7058;Best Tea on Earth!;I could drink cup after cup after cup of Harney and Sons Hot Cinnamon Spice Tea. And everyone around you will be able to smell the spicy cinnamon steaming out of your cup and will start drooling.
7059;Grandson and Pop-Pop's Favorite Cereal;This cereal has been a favorite of my husband for years. Our grandson now shares his love for it.
7060;Best Rootbeer Ever;This by far is the best rootbeer around.  It reminded me when I was a kid making Rootbeer floats with my grandfather, such a shame they don't carry it in the northeast, but awesome I can get it on Amazon.
7061;Another Clicktastic product!!;Well, our friends at Click have done it again!  This time with a delicious Vanilla Latte flavor. It is smooth, sweet, creamy and dissolves well (I use a shaker).
7062;Never mind the low ratings others have given;This granola is literally the best I have ever eaten.  Too often, people become accustomed to the packaged stuff and over-sweetened granola out of the supermarket.
7063;Best Sauce in a Jar.  Period.;The Marinara and Tomato Basil sauces are the closest to real Italian sauce that I have ever tested, probably better, having just returned from 2 weeks in Italy.  And we ate very well there.
7064;excellent product - amazingly speedy shipping;We have purchased this product for our dogs previously and can't praise it enough for how it improves our dogs' health.  This site was by far the best price we have ever found and the packaging was superior.
7065;Clean, good-smelling, family sized shampoo;The Clear Scalp Therapy Shampoo has an incredible scent, noticeable even before opening the bottle. Furthermore, its thick consistency requires a smaller amount to do the job relative to others brands on the market.
7066;Love, love, love this bread mix!;Homemade bread is awesome if you love the taste of fresh bread and want to save money. I own a bread machine which quickly paid for itself, but even making it by hand is well worth it.
7067;NO MORE BPA CANS! I AGREE.;Muir Glen cans are lined in plastic and leach Bisphenol A. Too bad because this was a great product and was a standard in my household.
7068;FIRST;FIRST!!!1!!!!!!11!!  that's all i really wanted to say.<br /><br />but this looks disgusting.
7069;WOW lots of coffee!!;what a huge selection!!  TONS to pick and choose from!  I won't get bored with all this!  I love having a big choice for coffee.  Sometimes you want a mild cup, sometimes you want something a bit stronger.
7070;yummy for my tummy;Tastes great, great product. No complaints with this.
7071;Delicious!;This gummy bear was absolutely delectable. I'm so tempted to buy another one, but I can't, as I'm trying to get into better shape.
7072;Smaller package, still 200mL;The picture on the product page still shows the older, rectangular packaging. What arrived was 24 of the new, smaller containers but they hold the same amount of Whiskas Cat Milk.
7073;Love these lollipops;I keep a bunch of these on my desk at work and people are always amazed at how good these are. The flavors are amazing.
7074;Sweet Leather for your dog;I was not impressed about this product (Made in China). Cheaply made and not very good quality.
7075;"Tastes like the worst ""office"" coffee";I ordered this case of pods based on all the positive reviews, which are usually right on (thanks everybody!), but I thought this coffee tasted horrible, and was especially disappointed because I love Starbucks Sumatra and it didn't have any of the distinctive Sumatra taste.  This is Sumatra BLEND.
7076;Must have for kids but go for on sale;I got these when they had a sale on amazon. So I got them for even less than the off-brands.
7077;Best to not purchase during warm months;I LOVE these bars however, this item should not be shipped during warm months. The bars arrived with the chocolate melted from the bars and stuck on the wrapper.
7078;great cheesy snack!;I love these little bunnies.  They are a nice healthy snack that tastes of real cheese.
7079;Lenore and Poe both give it 4 Paws up!;This stuff has huge chunks of fish in it. It smells/looks sort of like a can of human tuna, but has a nice blend of other foods to the aroma.
7080;Pretty bad;pros:<br />+ resistant to overbrewing (getting bitter) when left to steep for long periods of time<br /><br />cons:<br />- very little smell or taste<br />- cannot re-brew, even once
7081;Sent me in to after hours;I drank this tea and within an hour needed to go to an after hours urgent care center!  I have had numerous herbal teas in my life, and really I get to this one and have an allergic reaction?  Definately not happy now that I ordered the six pack and only went through one cup and a sip of another cup  before I started to have issues..
7082;Best bang for your buck;I've used cases of these popcorn portion packs and they are great.  The best value and ease of use in one package.
7083;Gramas Jalapeno Pepper Jelly;Very delicious. I use it as a garnish for many things including cream cheese, sandwiches, etc.
7084;Best Chicken and Broccoli in town!;I have been trying for years with no success to duplicate the flavor of typical chicken and broccoli recipes found in the Chinese restaurants and take out places that we all know and love. The solid ingredients of these recipes are obvious and simple, but the flavor of the sauce was always elusive.
7085;Yummy organic beans LOVE THEM!;Looking for affordable organic food that will stock the pantry.  I tried this company for the first time and are very pleased with them.
7086;Great Chocolates;You can taste the quality and care that goes into these chocolates. Great flavor, I highly recommend it.
7087;How can you call this coleslaw;Of all the coleslaw dressings I have tried,this is by far the worst-I dont know who does your reviews but they have no taste buds.I just cant imagine where anyone could have come up with this recipe.
7088;Excellent;My new favorite. was looking for an organic coffee & found this, not only excellent taste but also fair trade - the whole package.
7089;Quite tasty, but not particularly nutritious;"This product is made in Canada. The ingredients listed on the label are: ""Sugar, palm oil, hazelnuts, cocoa, skim milk, reduced minerals whey (milk), lecithin as emulsifier (soy), vanillin, an artificial flavor."
7090;unfortunate;They were sent with a past date of sale on them. Being it is hard candy I kept it but I think sell by dates need to be checked.
7091;Box-o-Chips;These chips were a great deal.  Kettle was having a special deal for the case of chips.
7092;STALE WALNUTS;I HAVE PURCHASED NUMEROUS WALNUTS FROM AMAZON BY DIFFERENT VENDORS AND THEY WERE GREAT.  THESE WERE AWFUL.
7093;AMAZING TASTE (I've had the almond apricot, fruit&nut, apple cinn pec, alm/cash/flax, etc).It's candy, dessert...;I would not use these as a meal replacement. Not enough protein, for one.
7094;Addictive!;I mada package of Annie's the night the shipment arrived and my husband and I loved it!  It is without a doubt the best shells and cheese box mix we've ever had.  I did substitute light soy milk for the milk called for on the box.
7095;Poor quality;I didn't like the Bob's Red Mill golden flax seed because it had too many pieces of stems and dark, discolored flax seeds in it.  I thought the price, compared to some other sellers, was too high.
7096;My cats love the tuna flavored IAMS.;I am no longer able to find original IAMS with tuna in my grocery store and I can only buy it online.  My cats love it.
7097;Heavenly...;These are a wonderful treat..
7098;Coffee Snob;This is exactly what it should be. A great price on decent instant coffee.
7099;Like others have mentioned. This soup is mediocre.;"Saw this on the store shelf recently after not seeing Wolfgang Puck soups available for purchase in a long time. The previous red label non ""organic"" version of this soup was one of the best I've tasted."
7100;Great Tasting and Refreshing;My family and I are all tea lovers - both hot and cold.  The Lipton to-Go is of course an iced green tea.
7101;Prevent barfing;We have two cats and one has very long hair and of course after cleaning themselves they get hairballs. We tried several hairball control treats and these are the one our cats seem to prefer.
7102;Not quite all that...;My product was shipped very quickly, I'm grateful for that.  So far, I've found two packages with broken seals and stale product.
7103;Worthington Low Fat FriChik;I did not like the chewy,rubbery outer texture of the Fri Chik chunks..
7104;Close call!;I took my 10 year old cat in to the vet today for his yearly check up.  Turns out my cat is the picture of health, but needs to drop about 2 pounds.
7105;Awesome Set;I had a set that I bought from some catalog a few yesrs ago.  Didn't think would ever find them again.
7106;"Gives you a good caffeine ""hit""";"My wife and I like ""strong"" coffee, and Jet Fuel is just that.  It smells good during brewing (if you stand next to the Keurig while it is being brewer you can smell it) and it tastes like a good strong (but not expresso-strong) coffee."
7107;An Alternative and Addition to A1 Sauce;I suggest that you keep some of this in your kitchen's cabinet even if you are an A1 user.<br />They are similar but not the same.
7108;av in tucson;This is a vegetable/grain source of high-quality protein with very little fat.  More importantly, it tastes great.
7109;DID NOT RECEIVE PRODUCT;PRODUCT WAS NEVER RECEIVED. THE SELLER WAS PROMPT WITH REFUND WHICH LEADS ME TO BELIEVE THE ITEM WAS NEVER SHIPPED IN THE FIRST PLACE.
7110;5 Star Reviews for a reason......;Like so many others I can only say positive things about these Treats.<br /><br />My 10 year old Golden / Lab mix loves them and they seem very easy for her to eat not being hard and crunchy yet firm and almost semi-moist.
7111;Truly Delicious Truly Chocolate;This cocoa, Bellagio Chocolate Truffle Cocoa Mix, is this chocolate lover's<br />dream.  A topping of whipped cream (mit schlag) and I'm transported to the Vienna of my imagination.
7112;Saved my cat's life twice?;About 6 months ago, I found out that my kitty has kidney disease. He was extremely ill, and I was planning on putting him down if he got any worse.
7113;Srirach cool stuff for making spicy mayo.;"<a href=""http://www.amazon."
7114;Love it!;I absolutely love this soup! I was a little worried at first about the calories in one container, but when I received the package, I realized there are only 85 calories in 1 serving, so there are only 170 calories in one whole cup. The information is wrong on the nutritional information.
7115;chef's secret(Charleston,SC);I am a retired professional chef. I use this base at home in at least one dish daily.
7116;Taste great, not messy;My daughter officially gives these 5 stars - she just loves them.  These were her first finger food, and they remain her favorite.
7117;One of my wife's favorite flavors!;If you are a diabetic and have ever attended a nutrition class for diabetics you probably have heard of this product. We have a whole collection of the different flavors and I have posted a photo of some of the ones we use the most.
7118;cats loved it;i opened the can and thought..
7119;Dogs can't get enought of them;Can't keep them around too long.  Definitely worth using subscribe and save.
7120;What sort of product description is this?;"I have not tried this product, and probably wont because when I tried to read the product description, I read the following:<br /><br />""Over 90% of All Men Will Develop an Enlarged Prostate or Some Type of Prostate Problem During Their Lifetime Most prostate problems such as prostate infection, BPH (benign prostatic hyperplasia) and Prostatitis are caused by an enlarged prostate. As you age, the likelihood of facing the problem of a swollen or enlarged prostate gland increases yearly."
7121;Ole! Now we're cooking!!!;I am already a fan of all Nueva Cocina Products and this Paella dish just made me look like the world's best cook. I added shrimp, little-neck clams, bay scallops, mussels, and one fillet of grouper cut in chunks.
7122;Nice flavour;I like this coffee, its nice to drink it in the morning. It has medium body and full flavour.
7123;Wow;I love this stuff.<br />If you like licorice, this is a licorice lover's dream.
7124;These are great!;I ordered these as a Lightning Deal. Never tried it but it was like 50% off.
7125;Delicious but really overpriced;These crunchy granola bars are really tasty but the price is just too high for my wallet. I had signed up for Subscribe & Save but even on the current 15% off promotion combined with the Subscribe & Save discount they are still way too over priced so I regrettably had to cancel my subscription.
7126;Tried To Use With My Soda-Club Unit;I purchased this Cola Syrup, and many other to test with my Soda-Club soda making machine. I make many different flavors with it, but I've had a hard time find a Cola Syrup produces the taste of Coke Cola.
7127;Hard to find;This product is amazing and cannot be found in Arizona stores..
7128;mixed doggy reviews;my dog Loves the Loving Pets Gourmet duck and chicken sticks but I am concerned b/c they are made in China so I wanted to wean him off those and found the Newman's chicken sticks as a similar treat. My dog has met them w/ mixed reviews, he is not crazy about them but will ultimately eat it.
7129;Healthier alternative for chip fix;In the last 8 years or so, there's been a potato chip Renaissance in the US.  I hadn't eaten potato chips in years, as the taste vs.
7130;He loves it;"Well- my mastiff is able to get the whole thing in his mouth and bite down- which pops the treat out immediately. So I thought- ""great- another waste of money""."
7131;A Real Disappointment;First off, I love the full size Homestyle Pop Secret, but most of the time the amount was too much for me. I thought this product would be perfect, what a disappointment.
7132;Amazing.;I have tried half of the flavors so far, and every one of them has tasted OUT OF THIS WORLD! for a package of snack food that has very little crap in it, i'm really surprised at how great they taste. I would definitely buy this stuff again.
7133;Why no uncut version;Come on now.  how can you make a 20th anniversary deluxe edition without having the original version.
7134;Delicious, protein bar;"Simply Bar's are a perfect snack packed full of protein. I am a new-vegetarian and I have always steered clear of ""protein bars"" because of the high calories and high sugar content."
7135;Tasty Waffles!;I'm a big fan of waffles, and this mix is great.  I will buy this product again for sure.
7136;Same Old, Slightly Smaller;These are your standard Honey Maid Honey Grahams, just packaged with slightly smaller servings. Instead of the huge crackers, you get half-sized squares that are bundled in smaller wrappers.
7137;Jelly Belly Smoothie Blend;We normally love all Jelly Belly flavors, but Smoothie Blend was a disappointment.<br /><br />Pro: Fresh/Fast Delivery<br />They arrived in a timely manner and were very soft and fresh.
7138;Pretty good...;Its a little bit darker than I had expected but the flavor is nice. Brews a perfectly flavored 12oz travel mug.
7139;Thank you, thank you, thank you!;I am soooooo glad to learn that I can still find Talking Rain!  I've been buying from Costco for years and was so disappointed when I checked our two local Costco stores and couldn't find it.  I'm placing my order today for TWO cases!  I love all the flavors and what I really want is Zero calories plus lots of carbonation! Thanks so much for making this available.
7140;Way overpriced;Dark Magic is one of my two favorite k-cups (the other is Green Mountain Sumatran Reserve).  But this is way overpriced at 24 k-cups for 23.
7141;My dog loves these;My dog has a very sensitive tummy, but I use these for training all the time and they don't bother him.  The price is great.
7142;Never again;We decided to try this dogfood because it was a few dollars cheaper than the Iams weight control that we normally buy.  We have spent FAR more than those few dollars in paper towels and cleaning supplies.
7143;Yum;This is an excellent and bold decaf.  The flavor really reminds me of Cafe du Monde's coffee in New Orleans' French Marketplace!  It also tastes very nice and bold on the 12 oz.
7144;alot of can, little lemonade;Small very well built cans filled with suggary not very lemonade or raspberry tasting clumpy powder. Didn't go very far.
7145;Great tasting, and no sugar!;I bought these, not for an after workout bar, but for a morning/lunch bar when I am running low on time.<br /><br />These taste great, have a true cocoa taste to them.
7146;Didn't expect much...very surprised;I had minimal expectations for this tea. I've had low energy for months and have resorted to drinking ridiculous amounts of coffee.
7147;WONDERFUL;These taste like brownies should taste, chocolaty and moist.  For those of you like me are trying to stay away from sugar, these are a treat.
7148;Yummy - my fav cookie;First had this on a flight, but tracked this little mama down to partake in again. And again.
7149;Simple and Convenient;A one thousand (sometimes 1200) packets of Splenda is $20.88 at Sam's Club as of this review.
7150;Worse than the average bulk organic navy bean from health food stores;Even though these beans seemed fresh, they had terrible flavor. They were way worse than the average navy bean from the bulk bins of my local health food stores.
7151;Wow!;This is a new favorite of mine. The flavor is light with no tannic after taste.
7152;Cocoa Puffs...;This tastes just like the milk left after a bowl of cocoa puffs..
7153;Along these lines;This was the best purchase that I could have made for my daughter. It was priced beautifully and my daughter can study without worrying about the price for her college books.
7154;Laxative Lollipops;Anyone who has eaten as much sugar free candy as I have over the years knows that there are side effects to most calorie- free sweeteners.  However, the side effect of these lollipops is close to the worst side effect I have ever experienced!  I had three lollipops one day, granted two were eaten one right after the other (I was at the movies!) and the restroom situation was dire.
7155;Extra Bold, You Bet;Of all the K-Cups we have tried, and that's a bunch, this one is the hands down favorite for flavor and boldness.  This is the one the spoon stands up in, the jolt that brings you to life no matter what.
7156;A good price for a not so healthy convenience food;The price on this product was quite good.  I was aware before I bought it that it has more fructose than high fructose corn syrup, which I avoid like the plague because it increases one's triglycerides.
7157;This is a wonderful chili!;We have been trying several chilis by small companies via Amazon and this one so far is our favorite.  I added some non-soy meat substitute crumbles and that gave it a very nice texture.
7158;Loved them!;Tastykake Coconut Juniors are the best!  Not too sweet, lots of coconut flavor, and the kake is moist, yet still holds it's shape.  I only wish they were sold in California, so I didn't have to get them through the mail.
7159;Great chocolate fix;They are so soft and great chocolate taste. They are made with whole grains but no one will ever know.
7160;Decent Flavors but a little weak;Even on the small cup setting of the elite, these are a little weak for me.  Make sure you shake the cups before putting them in your machine or they will be way too weak.
7161;Does not live up to claims;I was very disappointed with this product after using the Everlasting Treat Ball inserts and really liking the Everlasting Ball.<br /><br />The initial problem was screwing the two ends onto the rod.
7162;****Not your typical Starbucks, but good****;"Living in Seattle and using K-cups for over 3 years, I can attest this is a better tasting and more complex flavor than the ""typical medium roast"" choices and would argue with reviewers that this is a generic blend branded with the Starbucks name.  I would compare this to Coffee People Donut Shop (highly-rated and our personal home staple) with a hint of deeper roasted flavor."
7163;STrong flavor;I really like the Lara bar series of bars.  This one is yummy but very strong.
7164;My Boxer loves'em.;Ohhh my poor Vet. He told me I can only purchase these at his clinic for like double the price.
7165;No Stars If I Could...;"This product should not be allowed to be labeled ""Solid"" in fact is doesn't even resemble what is sold as chunk tuna in other brands.  This is not my usual brand, I was shocked when I opened the can!  First off if you shook the can it sounded like it was full of water."
7166;Great tastinng tea, and inexpensive.;We discovered this tea at a neighborhood restaurant, and it was excellent.  That's indeed why I had order it from you as soon as I saw it.
7167;crisp and clean;The biting touch of cranberry and the soothing flavor and aroma of apple. Reminiscent of a cranberry cocktail when served cold - a great flavored iced tea - and hot, just flake in some cinnamon and drift off in la-la land as you consume a near zero-calorie apple pie.
7168;excellent coffee;Having lived near Chicago for most of my adult life, I moved to a very rural spot in the northeast with few coffee offerings, even the grocery store (yes, store in singular).  Starbucks is two hours  away, and the only choice I had was to buy an espresso maker and begin to experiment.
7169;Excellent cat food;Several of my cats have dietary restrictions and since they have been eating this canned food they haven't had any problems. (mainly urinary tract and bladder infections).
7170;mmmmm;This was a great product, shipped quickly and was hassle free. I will consider buying this on a regular basis.
7171;Great Taste Small Price;A delicious product, can't seem to find it in the stores these days. I recommend to try if you like pork rinds.
7172;Love these treats!;"I got some of these through a friend of mine who bought them for his dog.  He swore no dog could resist them and he was right!  I had the apple dumpling flavored treats and my little dog,  ""Magic"" was hooked!  The ingredients are human grade and could be consumed by humans (though they don't taste great to the average person's palate!)."
7173;Quick, Easy & Delicious;This Cup O Noodles is my go-to quick snack or dinner. Quickly cooks in its own cup - and tastes great.
7174;Not for kittens less than 6 months old!;My 4 month old kitten usually eats another variety of Whiskas Temptations (Chicken Flavor Dentabites, which he LOVES!), but he's gotten into the habit of eating my hair that I've shed and that's fallen on the floor(gross, I know), so I decided to get him this hairball control variety of Whiskas Temptations.  The fine print on the package says that it should not be used on kittens less than 6 months of age.
7175;Satisfied;The fencer works good.The donkeys respect it! Thanks for free shipping.
7176;Smooth;Kona is my favorite pod!  Smooth rich silky flavor.  I prefer Timothy's Kona but the seasons have not been kind to the Kona beans lately and it's out of stock.
7177;Closet thing to French coffee with chicory;I grew up drinking coffee in New Orleans.  I have been soooo disappointed with all of the K-cup coffees because they are so mild.
7178;Tasty chocolate, but not much else.;I found the actual granola part to be rather bland, though I did enjoy the crunchy texture. The chocolate part is delicious in contrast to the granola.
7179;fabulous brownies;This brownie mix makes fabulous, moist and fudgy brownies.  I use canola oil instead of butter with excellent results.
7180;Manuka magick!;This is an excellent quality Manuka Honey product.  There is a bit of confusion over the UMF, MGO and OMA rating thing.
7181;Just as described.  We like it.;The flavor is different,and a little 'earthy' for us, but we brew it together with another tea which works well.  This is a good value.
7182;Good Tasting But A Ripoff!!;Yo-<br /><br />Nowhere in the description does it state how much ham you are getting - well - it's SIX OUNCES which comes out to $63.73 PER POUND - plus shipping!!!<br /><br />The one pound for $28 plus $20 shipping is the better (but still NOT good) buy.
7183;it's almost like heaven;Have tried it. Delicious!!!!! I think I'm in love.
7184;Plastic-Flavored Coconut Water;So far, I've loved all of the coconut water brands and flavors I've tried, including Zico. However, this was the first one I tried in a plastic bottle and was disappointed to find that there is a little bit of a plastic flavor to it.
7185;Good stuff, definately has a kick!;I got this when I was looking for a good ginger tea.  Admittedly, I'm sure it was my error in not reading closely enough, but do note that this is not a tea nor does it come in tea bags.
7186;consistenly good;I like a more robust flavored coffee and try a few different ones. This Tullys Italian Roast consistently delivers.
7187;hands down, the worst tasting fitness bar i've ever tried.;If I wanted unprocessed unsweetened cherries, dates, and almonds, I would eat them all individually, not mashed up and packaged up in a bar.  These taste terrible.
7188;easy pizza crust;I use this product 1-2 times a week and it's great. Yeah, you can tweak it, that's part of the beauty of this product.
7189;Marley Coffee One Love;Using it as intended with a single serve pod brewer, I found it to be weak but I liked the smell so much I wanted to find another way to try it. I also have a Breville single serve coffeemaker so I decided to brew one by cutting open the pod and using my k-cup.
7190;Excellent Tea;I'm picky when it comes to tea, in fact this is the only bagged tea I own - because I simply prefer loose leaf tea which I perceive to be healthier as well as tastier. However, I tried this tea because locally, we don't have a lot of loose leaf tea options.
7191;Great for puppies and small dogs!;I bought this product because my sister had a mixed breed puppy that was chewing on anything and everything.  Nothing she did worked to break the puppy from destroying whatever was available, even if it was the corners on the baseboards.
7192;Delicious!  If you like olives and like corn chips, you must try them!;AMAZING chips.  I picked them up at Whole Paycheck, and as soon as I'd had a few, I ran to Amazon to see if I could buy them by the carton!<br /><br />I believe I have never tasted a better chip of any sort.
7193;Newman's Bold;This is my favorite coffee.  I use it when I really want to enjoy my coffee.
7194;Misleading;This is advertized as a (Set of 5).  Only 1 was recieved.
7195;YUMMY  HEALTHY  SNACK;It's good alterative to junk food.  I reccomend trying TINGS TOO !!<br /><br />  These snacks are soooo  good.
7196;Crystal Light;Could not get any flavors other than Lemonaide, Teas and Rasberry at Store.  Bought enought to last a very long time.
7197;Not Made for Human Consumption;Do not buy Wild Ride Beef Jerky. I purchased two bags of this jerky and they both ended up in the trash.
7198;Taste kind of strange....;To start, I'm a big fan of Blue Diamond brand Almonds. I really like the bold flavors, Habanero BBQ and Lime & Chili.
7199;THEY HAVE  WATERED DOWN  THIS PRODUCT;SINCE NEW  OWNERS - WATERED DOWN  - 2 TABLESPOONS  OF PRODUCT WAS 190 CALORIES --NOW 1/3 CUP IS 140 CALORIES - DOES NOT STIFFEN IN FRIGE - LIKE BEFORE<br />NOT TASTY LIKE BEFORE<br />MORE WATER AND MORE  GUAR  GUM = JUNK<br /><br />COMPLAIN TO THEM OR THEY MAY WATER DOWN MORE - THEIR PHONE NUMBER IS ON CAN.  EXAMPLE OF  PURE GREED.
7200;Great as a meal or side dish ...;"I purchased this from GoPicnic as part of a package for travel and purchased extras to ""try ahead of time.""<br /><br />This particular meal is both gluten-free and vegetarian."
7201;Do what it says;It definitely works.  Be sure to read the package carefully and follow up with frequent cleaning of the effected area.
7202;Clumpy;It is fabulous that there is an all natural food dye safe to use for my child allergic to anything chemical and artificial in his food. However, the dye is thick and goopy and makes the frosting much thicker and pastier than it should be, not smooth at all.
7203;Really Perks you UP!;I drink red bull, but sometimes I don't want to drink a whole can, so I keep these little bottles nearby and drink one of them.  One gulp and 15 minutes later I feel like I can get up off the couch and do something productive.
7204;Just Eat The Box;"I was seriously disappointed in the lack of flavor in these crackers.<br />I give the company an ""A"" for effort in trying to give these crackers<br />some flavor by adding sunflower kernels and fragrant basil."
7205;Dog loved it!;Dog loved this bone.  I think there should be a star section for price and value comparison.
7206;Tasty, crunchy! I like it, but...;Tasty, crunchy..
7207;Great Stuff;This stuff is great, while I don't like this kind as much as the Natural Calm with Calcium, it was my own fault for not looking close enough when I ordered the second bottle for the office. I actually look forward to having this in the AM with my breakfast and in the PM before bed.
7208;Unusual for me to not like a coffee;I really like Blue Mountain coffee the best..
7209;BEST CHAI BLACK & GREEN TEA;I HAVE BEEN EXPERIENCING WITH TEA'S SINCE OCTOBER OF 2010 AND I'D HAVE TO GIVE THIS TEA A FIVE + STAR!!!! NOT ONLY FOR ITS TASTE BUT FOR THE PRICE AS WELL. THIS IS BY FAR THE BEST TEA IVE EVER HAD.
7210;Dr Oz recommended!;Dr. Oz recommended fenugreek tea for your digestive track,(not this brand specifically).
7211;A refreshing beverage;We first started buying Izze drinks when my wife was pregnant and she was looking for alternatives to soda and coffee. The Izze products were among her favorites -- especially the Black Cherry flavor.
7212;updated nutrition facts;The latest shipment of the sardines had the following large changes in the nutrional profile:<br /><br />Before/After: (per 1 can)<br /><br />Calories 90/160 (the serving size increased from 1 to 2, so I'm multiplying the indicated calories by 2 (indicated 80 on the box) for proper comparison)<br />Total Fat 3g/8g<br />Saturated Fat 0g/2g<br />Sodium 280mg/560mg<br />Protein 16g/22g<br /><br />I'm not sure whether to believe the old vs new.  Regardless, these sardines are good, just not sure about the accuracty of the data given the large change.
7213;Hungarian Paprika;This is the best paprika available
7214;Too Much of a Good Thing;The potato chips were fine, but everybody (five kids and two adults!) got tired of the same flavor after a while.  A variety pack box would've been better.
7215;excellent;if Amazon has all the suppliers like this, customer would not worry about getting their order in time.I think the quality of this product was good that's why I ordered more than one time.
7216;Try it on spagetti;I like this so much because it is hot but not too hot, in fact I love it. It's delicious.
7217;Supercalafragilisticexpialadocious!!;I am soooo glad I found this seasoning for my popcorn. I use a hot air popper(Orville Redenbacher's) which I had just purchased from Amazon, of course.
7218;LOVE LOVE LOVE this food.;My Persian loves this food and it's not all over the floor. She can actually pick it up and eat it.
7219;Amazon saves marriages;Nothing beats the taste of getting food off of the intranez.<br /><br />I once too was one of many that wasted my life away by going to the store.
7220;Love Pamela's products!;I've been using Pamela's Pancake & Baking Mix for over a year and loving it.  It's very versatile so that is what prompted me to try the Bread mix.
7221;gut noodles;My husband calls these noodles 'gut' noodles.  They are slimmy and chewy and do not resemble regular 'noodles' what so ever.
7222;Not Gluten Free;For some reason this is listed in the gluten free section, and it shouldn't be.  Even the cover of the box says it contain wheat.
7223;great iced tea;We used to love Trader Joes' blueberry green tea, as it had a great blueberry taste when served hot. I bought this, hoping it'd be as good.
7224;Perfect straight out of the can;We've been big fans of the regular non-organic Zoe EVOO in a can, but always wanted an organic alternative.  Unfortunately, the organic Zoe in the red can is quite peppery and grassy
7225;Pond water would taste better..;Stale, tastless crap. Dont bother.
7226;Surprised to LOVE IT!!!  Tastes really good.;"Okay so I ordered every flavor of these during the summer sale in June were most of the flavors $12, and if you signed up ""Subscribe and Save"" they were $10.50 each."
7227;Great for quick lunch;I just now had this for lunch and it was great. Perfect amount for a sandwich and only 100 calories for the whole pouch (bread adds more of course).
7228;Dog loved it, but it wasn't that durable;I have a large dog who's normally very soft-mouthed and doesn't destroy his toys -- he has cloth chew ropes and fuzzy animals that are several years old at this point.<br /><br />He went through this dinosaur like an eight-year-old through Christmas morning, though.
7229;spicy vegetarian noodles;I am a vegetarian so I always look for those food items.  These Paldo Hwa Raymyn noodles are just delicision, very spicy, with 2 packets for seasoning.
7230;My dog adores these delicious treats;"My dog has long displayed a preference for cheese above nearly any other substance, so I was delighted when a friend gave him one of these as a Christmas gift.  He loved it!  This is a healthy treat (in moderation, of course) and allows you to give your dog cheese without treading in ""human food"" territory, which many of us try to avoid."
7231;Really horrible;This is really horrible coffee. It is especially bad in an espresso machine.
7232;THERE ARE MANY GOOD BRANDS OF BREWERS YEAST - TWIN LABS ADDS TASTE & VALUE TO A WINNING FORMULA;"IN A NUTSHELL: VERY GOOD TASTING ""REAL BREWER'S YEAST"" -- NOTHING ADDED<br /><br />This ""Genuine Brewer's Yeast"" powder tastes very good for real Brewers Yeast. Having said that, remember this is not a vitamin or mineral -- BREWER'S YEAST is one of the ultimate super-foods, a veritable food supplement by itself."
7233;To Much and Mushy;I love chocolate but this is just too much for me.  I love cereal but this is more of a desert then it is something you should start your day with.
7234;Pretty average;I'll admit that I am spoiled by really great chocolate from my local chocolate shop so this bar was a bit of a disappointment.  It was hard, waxy and not very flavorful.
7235;Cheese Powder is great, Amazon's price hike stinks!;I ordered a 6-pack of this last fall for about $15, which was a great price, and my toddler loves the cheese powder on popcorn, noodles and broccoli! However, there's no way I'm paying $34 and change for it, and I don't see why the price has more than doubled in less than a year. That's $5.
7236;Some of the healthiest cereal you'll find!;First off, this product is awesome. As others have said, no added sugars, high fiber and protein.
7237;Pretty good hot chocolate;I'm giving this product 5 stars because I think it is great considering that it is made with water.  The hot chocolate is best if you shake the cup and then brew using the smallest possible cup size.
7238;Liquorice Altoids;I was hesitant to order this product, not knowing how strong the mints would be, and with it being a whole case of 12.  But they are very tasty.
7239;Great tea at a great price!;I love this tea! This is the first time I have ever drank any matcha tea and I love the taste and consistancy. It was shipped very fast too! My only concern, and I can't seem to find the answer anywhere is: how much flouride, and/or are there any heavy metals present? Is this tea safe to consume on a daily basis? If anyone knows these answers please comment and let me know.
7240;not individually wrapped so you can't just stick one in your purse or pocket;It's my fault for not reading the reviews carefully since I now see that at least one reviewer mentioned the fact that these are all in one package, albeit resealable.  What I wanted was individually wrapped wipes to take in my purse for when mosquitoes suddenly began biting my ankles at an outdoor restaurant or on a picnic.
7241;Delicious;After I tried these they simply became my favorite candy.<br /><br />They are a combination between jelly beans and nerds.
7242;Could be better;The smell is nice but a bit strong and lingers a little too long for my liking, and the exfoliating 'grains' are a nice feature but can be a bit harsh if you use this on a daily basis.  It lathered nicely though and I did feel nice and clean when I rinsed, although not necessarily overly moisturized.
7243;Great flavor!;I am on a low-cal diet so this product appealed to me since I drink coffee. The flavor is great, very chocolatey to say the least.
7244;Great for a Shrimp Boil;Really adds flavor when boiling shrimp.  Someone gave it to us as a gift years ago and we've used it ever since.
7245;4.5 Stars for Ease of Use, Availability and Taste;I admit I'm kind of a wimp when it comes to hot spicy things. For that reason, lots of times I end up not liking hot wings which can be disheartening after you've gone to all the expense and work to create the wings.
7246;Very pleased with the distribution;I read other reviews and I wasn't sure to buy this or not for my brother's party as a favor.<br />Being Star Wars fan of IV, V and VI versions only I was really happy and pleased to have received mostly characters from such versions only.
7247;Bueno!;Cant make corn tortillas or tamales without masa harina. These folks ship their product in sturdy boxes.
7248;No Health Benefits and Grossly Overpriced....Read the Nutrition Facts;My wife just brought home a $3 package containing 5.5 oz of Murray Sugar Free Pecan Shortbread cookies, thinking the high price was justified on a health basis.
7249;Good stuff!;Tasty, cramp-free energy gel that's easy to access while you're running.  I've had some that taste a bit better and are a bit smoother, but they are more expensive.
7250;Great Bar for Breakfast;These are great bars and I became used to having one each morning. The taste is addictive and if you're a chocolate or snickers lover you're really going to like them.
7251;Vitality Mini Chicken treats;My dogs love these and they are small enough that I don't feel guilty giving them more than one per day. The only problem is I can't find them in stores so I am stuck with the high rising costs.
7252;Looks and smells gross, but my baby wouldn't stop eating it!;Our pediatrician recommended this flavor combination when we first started solids because it has 120% of daily iron needs.  Well, when I sat down to feed it to my baby, all I could was, wow, this is so gross!  It looks pretty much the same way going in as it does coming out, if you know what I mean.
7253;Absolutely, positively the VERY BEST PEANUTS EVER!!;I am a hard-core aficianado of peanuts.  In the shell at baseball games and fooball games
7254;Italians make everything better, Especially WATER!;I am currently drinking some San Pellegrino and decided to review. I am not classy enough to go fetch a glass so i'm drinking out of the bottle.
7255;Just cashews and sea salt!;The best cashews I've found.  I love that they're just cashews and sea salt, roasted dry without added oils.
7256;Delicious!;I thought I didn't like real maple syrup
7257;takes a special person;so i tried the garlic one and i made a mistake..
7258;Best Chocolate Cake I've had in a long time;Its wonderful to find a chocolate cake I can eat !  Note the box, however, it does make just one layer..
7259;Better in the jar;I previously tried ordering floss sugar in the cartons. That was a big mistake
7260;my dog loves Greenies;My dog, Shadow,  loves Greenies more than any treat. He's a Pomeranian and gets the Teenies, and are we in trouble if we run out!  I just bought the tub of 96 on Amazon for less than half the money that the small packages cost at the store.
7261;Really Works;I had my doubts at first, so I researched it and found favorable reviews from different wine/food pubs. Besides looking great, the stand is stable and secures the aerator quite well.
7262;Dreamy Vanilla Tea;Numi teas are blended to an elegant perfection. Numi Decaf Black Vanilla is no exception and will please anyone who loves mild black tea with a hint of vanilla.
7263;Good Coffee.  Excellent Price.  But French Roast if Far Better;While the Eight O'Clock Coffee Columbian Roast produced a decent brew, it is not nearly as good as the Eight O'Clock Coffee French Roast.  I was actually surprised by this because most of the Eight O'Clock Roasts are REALLY good.
7264;Good Coffee;This coffee is great for those who like a bold flavor. Buying the 50 pack saves a little money for the k-cup drinkers.
7265;Great hot cereal;This organic brown rice farina beats cream of wheat hands down. I have it for breakfast nearly every morning.
7266;Had off/chemical taste;I ended throwing these out.  They did not taste right and had a bad chemical taste.
7267;Great breakfast and snack;This is the only breakfast cereal I can get all three kids to eat.  In fact when it comes in I have to put their names on the boxes so the oldest does not plough through her two (allocated) boxes within four days.
7268;Good... if you need it;While I like my coffee strong, I am slightly susceptible to acidic coffee - just not enough to have to seek out alternatives. If you are to that point, I would recommend this coffee as a good alternative, but if you are not quite to that point, this is not a substitute for great coffee.
7269;I LOVE KIND BARS!;"I love the kind bars, they are great for any time of the day. Perfect with a cup of coffee, or an ""on the go snack""."
7270;cats love it;Cats love it! And Wellness is a brand I trust. Cats only get canned food once a week as a treat, and this does not adversely affect kitty tummies or the litter box between premium dry food meals.
7271;Delicious!;I have only used this product to make my peanut butter smoothies. My husband loves pb smoothies but was skeptical about trying this powdered version.
7272;Taste & texture is just like regular pasta!;I fixed this pasta a few days ago with a meat sauce, honestly, there was no difference in taste & texture and it warmed up beautifully. My son ate the last of it two days after I made it and he said it was delicious.
7273;Great, natural product;Wellness is a great cat food that my kitties just love. I chose this brand for its natural ingredients.
7274;Way better than Pop-Tarts;"Fantastic ""toaster pastries"" aka Pop Tarts. Buying them in bulk as snacks for work makes them as cheap as Pop Tarts at much higher quality and taste, and organic to boot."
7275;I like it;I would rate this coffee as very good if you like your coffe on the strong side.  I wish Starbucks was not so expensive.
7276;Hazelnut (Filberts) in a fragile crescent shaped tea cookie.;Delicate ground hazelnut cookies for a Ladies tea, NOT for children or most men! Appreciated only by sophisticated palates, because they are neither cloyingly sweet or fatty. Set these aside for unexpected guests you'd like to impress.
7277;My Dogs LOVE These Biscuits;I have known for a long time that Canidae is a great product, and is not usually sold in stores, so when I saw these biscuits on the Amazon website, I immediately ordered them.  I have two Eskies (miniature American Eskimo Dogs) so I had to have enough for both of them.
7278;It's ok;I purchased this maples syrup for the Master Cleanse diet, which is great for that.  I tried using on pancakes and the taste was not to my satisfaction.
7279;Diet drinks taste like diet soda from the old days;"I got a SodaStream for my birthday.  It comes with a 12 pack syrup sampler with 6 diet syrups and 6 ""regular"" syrups."
7280;Amazing cookies!;I bought some Nana's No Refined Sugar cookies in several flavors when a local health food store was having a moving sale. They were so incredible I looked online and was delighted to find them on amazon, and bought some here.
7281;Baby food;Same baby food as in the store, but delivered right to your door.  This is a nice flavor for getting vegetables into a kid who won't ordinarily eat them.
7282;FABULOUS Product;I found this same brand at my local health food store for less than half the online price.  It IS a solid, but a temperate solid at that.
7283;Delicious Moka Coffee;"This grind of Illy's popular Normale roast coffee was created specifially for the Bialetti Moka Express coffee maker. <a href=""http://www."
7284;FREE SHIPPING for $35 orders-----LIARS..do not believe this;I ordered these because it stated FREE shipping for orders over $35 dollars..
7285;Absolutely Delicious!;I have already done a review for this product at Amazon.  I said the product, Angie's Caribbean Black Cake, arrived on time and well packaged in a festive red tin symbolizing the Christmas Season.
7286;Cat Man Doo Rocks - all other flakes are crumby.;My cat's LOVE the Cat-Man-Doo Bonito Flakes.  I've tried some of the others (you know who they are)BUT they weren't as fresh and they had lots of very small crumbs.
7287;Slight off taste;We ordered the Ah!Laska Organic Chocolate Syrup because it's organic and received generally positive reviews.  We find that it has a slight off taste - hard to describe, but it just didn't taste as good as we hoped or expected.
7288;Good, but VERY strong;I generally like bold-flavored coffee, but this was too strong for me.  However, my son-in-law absolutely loves it, so if you are looking for really strong flavorful coffee, you should try this.
7289;A GREAT choice!;Our vet recommended these pouches for our 2 cats to help them loose weight.  Dry food is full of carbs, and he suggested wet food since it's mostly protein and fat - what they would be eating in the wild.
7290;This is one of my favorite coffee's;This is great, you've got to try it. I have purchased this before, and loved it.
7291;In one word....delicious....;I could tell as soon as the box was delivered this was going to be great coffee.  You could already smell the coffee through the box.
7292;My Westie loves these!;These little treats are his favorite treat and he loves all three flavors but especially the peanut butter flavor.  They are great for training or just because.
7293;Dog fell sick;I have a 1.5 yr old golden who LOVES to chew! These raw hides are tightly rolled up like the others have mentioned and he has to chew through the whole thing.
7294;Hibiscus Tea.... Really good;I tried this at Starbucks and loved it (even though theirs is different), so I brew up a container and mix it with decaf green tea and it is very refreshing and fruity. Healthy for your too, give it a try instead of sugary fruit punch for kids, brew up use your favorite sweetner and lots of ice.
7295;These are AWESOME!;These are some of the best chips that I have ever had..
7296;pb2;The PB2 is everything it said it was. When you mix the 2 tbls of pb2 with 1 tbsp of water just make sure you do not put in extra water as it is mushy and doesn't taste right.
7297;Great coffee even when used with the espresso machine.;Great coffee. The cream that comes out with the espresso machine is always perfect!<br />If you like a strong bold aroma this is the coffee for you.
7298;Not the best Snyder's of Hanover Pretzels;"Snyder's of Hanover makes good pretzels (Honey Mustard & Onion is my favorite), but these are just not appetizing at all.  ""Hot Buffalo Wing"" gets its kick from dried cayenne pepper sauce."
7299;My cats and puppy each say this taste good;My cats really love these treats. They come running every time I grab the bag.
7300;Yech!;Walden Farms seems to be a really hit-or-miss company. Some of their products are downright DELICIOUS (see: their pancake syrup) but some are absolutely disgusting (see: this product).
7301;LURVE This Snack!!;Are you kidding? These are amazing. Salty, delicious, AND healthy?!? I tried them once and ordered the case the next day.
7302;This is my Golden's favorite everlasting flavor;They quickly pop it out of the large everlasting treat ball, and still remain entertained by it for some time.  I've never had any abdominal problems from this product, like you can get from rawhides, bones, and especially the Greenies (which dogs cannot dissolve and so can create abdominal obstructions).
7303;Excellent coconut water, great packaging;This water is great, I prefer the normal flavor, but the Passion Fruit version is good too. This stuff is great after a workout or a bike ride.
7304;If you have to drink decaf, this is the way to go for flavor.;My doctor told me I have to stop drinking regular coffee because I was having what FELT like heart attacks..
7305;Wow, super yummy!;I really enjoy muesli but the selection at my local grocery and health food store consists of either over-processed, sweetened junk or flavorless cardboard.  This brand showed up at the grocery so I picked it up on a whim and I am certainly not disappointed!<br /><br />Absolutely delicious.
7306;Sushi Rice;Best Sushi Rice that I have used.  Texture, Taste and ease of cooking is perfect.
7307;Something went TERRIBLY wrong!!!;I received this Gloria Jean's Hazelnut coffee this weekend
7308;Once again, America's food scientists bring us a new snack!;POPCHIPS CHILI LIME POTATO is a crunchy potato chip, that is not your grandfather's potato chip.  First, for the positive comments.
7309;Light, Fresh Potato Soup;I like this potato soup
7310;A Unique Tea!;Pu'erh Tuo-Cha is a unique tea. Smooth flavor with no bitterness.
7311;Too much salt, not enough mojo;Late July makes excellent products, and their Mild Green Mojo chips have plenty to crow about: they're whole-grain, the cheese doesn't use animal rennet, and part of the proceeds funds summer camps for kids.  The chips themselves are hearty and satisfying, like all Late July products I've tried  -  they don't incite that gobble-gobble-gobble never-full reaction that cheap junk food does.
7312;Excellent Flavor;When I got my Keurig brewer last month, I bought two different types of hot chocolate.  The Grove Square Hot Chocolate is far superior.
7313;Monster Lo-Carb is yummy!!;I drink at least one monster Lo-Carb a day and I love them..
7314;BHA & BHT & HAIR!!! WTF;"I had bought a pack for my new puppy thinking he will love these.""NOTE THIS WAS NOT THE SELLER""Little did i know there would be short light brown hair's all in the treat's I know sounds disgusting."
7315;PB2;Love them for shakes! Not bad on toast. Chocolate pb is delicious! The regular pb is good too.
7316;Where's the fun?;"So, the title ""Fresh Whole Rabbit"" perplexes me a bit. If it was really ""Fresh"" as it is stated, wouldn't it still be alive? This takes the fun out of 'hunting for wabbits' with my collector's addition Elmer Fudd hat on."
7317;Missing one pkg and missing taste Kay's Protein Chips;When I received this order I expected 12 pkgs but one was missing.  After tasting these, I find that I will not miss anything from these.
7318;Makes very weak coffee with a Hamilton Beach single cup machine;I've got a tiny Hamilton Beach single cup coffee maker that uses senseo pods. These melitta pods make a terrible cup of coffee in the machine, versus Senseo pods that actually turn out reasonably tasty for something so easy.
7319;yuck! way too sweet;Get the carrot & apple or pear & mango flavor from Plum Organics instead.  This was overwhelmingly sweet.
7320;Yummy Store Bought Cookie!;I love these. They taste great and they are easy to throw in your bag and bring a long with you for a snack for yourself or a child.
7321;Full-bodied black tea;Kusmi Russian Morning Tea makes English Breakfast Tea seem like dishwater.  This Russian black tea is full of flavor, rich, deep.
7322;Lysine;I use this product frequently for my cats to boost their immune systems. It's great to be able to obtain this product via the web in a quick and easy method.
7323;filter filter filter;I tried using both grape and peach white grape mango and I have to say the second was much better. I tried the grape after sitting four days instead of the two recommended after reading other reviews.
7324;Excellent;These oreo's were great, my family gobbled them up without conscience, i even had to hide some packs around the house so they would not over eat them hahaha. All i can say about these is Excellent i would reccommend these to every one.
7325;Decent taste;The producers of this coffee did a marvelous job on the artistic packaging, but the coffee itself lacks the pizazz I'd expect from a coffee pod. I made the coffee in more than just the coffee pod, including taking the grinds out of the pod and putting them through my own filter, but the result was still the same--the taste was forgettable.
7326;Great for every occasion;SPORTea is great for:<br />- 'wake-me-up' in a morning
7327;So Far, So Good.....;Since I got this for my elderly, frail cat who turns up her nose at a lot of canned food, I guess I'll rely on her judgment for the review.  She thinks it's pretty good.
7328;My Dog Loves it but theirs nothing he doesn't love;Great Dog food. Have been searching for a dog food that doesn't contain corn and animal by-products that dog food companies like to use as fillers and cheap ingredients.
7329;Amazing;This is my all time favorite tea. There's quite a bit of caffeine tho.
7330;Great bang for your buck;This organic decaf green tea goes and goes..
7331;Kind Gift;We purchased Kind Fruit & Nut, Apple Cinnamon & Pecan, Gluten Free Bars as a gift.  The gift was warmly received.
7332;Pleasant suprise;It's almost too good (interesting to see if it spike's my blook sugar). Got it at a local grocer (Sprouts) for under 5 bucks.
7333;Crunchy treats for the dogs in our life;Dog treats. What do you do with dog treats? Well, if you have a dog that is very food-centered, then dog treats are the best thing going as you can use them as the necessary treats for helping in training your dog, or maintaining his/her training later on in their lives.
7334;Be patient;Unless you are already familiar with working with sourdough and know what you are doing (which I didn't), you need to be very patient and experiment with this product.  I have now been working with the starter for about a month and I am still trying to get a loaf of sourdough bread similar to an 'artisian bread' from the market.
7335;mixed results;I've ordered this fizzy cola three times. Two packs each time for the free shipping, so a total of 72 bags
7336;Safer versus Pro-Pest;Both this product and Pro-Pest Clothes Moth Ready-To-Use Traps appear to be somewhat effective.  Two traps, one of each brand, were placed in two different closets (a total of four traps) over a three-month period with an insignificant  difference between the two brands in the number of moths caught, eight for Pro-Pest and seven for Safer.
7337;Sri Lanka - UPDATED;After my initial disappointment, I contacted Native Forest and asked them about the Sri Lanka sourcing of coconut milk. They informed me that they had already discontinued their sourcing (this was around September 2011), and that the only remaining cans were those already stocked.
7338;Dogs go nuts for these liver treats;When I first go my Havanese puppy 1 1/2 years ago, the breeder suggested these liver treats for using when training.  My dog will do ANYTHING for these treats.
7339;Versatile;I grind these seeds up in a coffee grinder & give them to my dogs.  They are a natural dewormer, & add good fiber to their diet.
7340;Less is more......;This is the first product in the Amazing Grass line that I have tried and it tastes pretty good, I was happy about that..
7341;mmmmh... jummy;i really have to say I love this chamomile tea. Especially when I have a cough and/or cold I brew some and pour it in a bowl to inhale the chamomile vapors.
7342;I prefer a different brand;A Taste of Thai's Yellow Curry Rice is spicier than I like.<br />Therefore, I much prefer Thai Kitchen's Yellow Curry Rice.
7343;Everyday tea, not gourmet;English Breakfast is one of my favorite blends, but this Higgins & Burke tea is not my favorite brand. It's a weak tea without any distinctive flavor, and is easily overwhelmed by the average amount of sweetener and lemon that I put in my tea.
7344;OMG, best x-mas ham ever;Was actually off from work x-mas and needed to feed my family so on a whim and going off of other reviews I dropped the $60 this spiral ham cost. At $8.
7345;Our favorite;These are our absolute favorite almonds and love that there isn't any fake sugars in them.  I'll take more calories with real sweeteners any day over sucralose in the other brands.
7346;Great puffs for baby and a less sugar than many other brands;I found these puffs by accident in the grocery store. My daughter eats these like a mad little thing.
7347;Best green tea ever;By far the best-tasting green tea i've had. Many are weak tasting, like little more than water.
7348;Yamamotoyama Green Tea;"Individual packets of easy to mix iced green tea.  Not ""instant"" dehydrated product, but actual green tea, powdered."
7349;Think Thin Bars Rock;These are my favorite snack.  High in protein, low in sugar and fat.
7350;Pom loves this brand;my picky pom loves this brand.  I rotate between 3 flavors (he won't eat same flavor more than 2 days).
7351;one word...WOW;I work at a nutrition shop that sells protein bars/protein and other supplements, and i got to say..
7352;Good stuff;I picked one of these up at a convenience store for a snack. It was just the right amount for a mid-meal bite.
7353;The cat is happy.;My cat does extremely well on this food.  What does that mean? It means her hair is very soft, her stools are well formed, and she has maintained her weight well on this formula.
7354;Beaba baby cook;Love this machine-its all in one steamer and blender. Watch the mechanism for snapping bowl onto stand as the first one I purchased came cracked and probably from someone not watching as the parts line up to snap into a locked position.
7355;FOR COCONUT LOVERS;THIS PRODUCT IS GOOD IF YOU LIKE A STRONG COCONUT TASTE.  IT'S ALSO HIGH IN SAT FAT WHICH I DIDN'T REALIZE WHEN I MADE MY PURCHASE.
7356;So-So;Sometimes, you think, plain water is boring--especially when you know that you need to drink several glasses of it every day.  Having a product that gives a pleasant taste to water seems like a great idea.
7357;Terrible Product;"I will leave the ""tea dust"" discussion to the other reviews. My concern is the overbearing chemical taste that this product has."
7358;The Cats' meow;"We have two cats and they are picky with their ""crunchy"" food and seem to like most ""soft"" cat food. They both liked this soft food and didn't have any issues with it."
7359;Heavenly;So these bars are made of real things, and most of those things are organic!  Or all, I can't remember.  I don't like over processed food, and so this bar is perfect.
7360;The best mango pickle!;I've been buying this for years, as mango pickle, not relish. It's the same thing, but this is cut in smaller pieces.
7361;Bully sticks;My dogs like these and they at least last awhile. I have a huge dog and it takes him some time to chew.
7362;Kind;This is not the first time I've ordered this product. Love it and will order it again.
7363;Great size ,ingredients , and quality;I have been using Zuke's treats for years now. We probably use 1.
7364;The best blend!;I bought this tea last year directly from Chartreuse and have been doling it out on special occasions. I've tried other lemon/rooibus mixes, but this one has just the right balance--refreshing both hot and cold.
7365;Apple Crisp;First tried these at a family members house and really liked them. Grandkids like them.
7366;Terribly disapppointing;I followed the directions which suggest you use 6-8 ozs of water and add 3-4 tsps of product.  The result was a watered down tasteless mess, even when I used only 6 ozs of water and 4 tsps of the powder.
7367;eeewww! not so good!;according to the dietician at our vet's office this food has several elements at too high levels for cats. the most problematic being ash.
7368;Fantastic Pretzels;We try to avoid wheat here and there, so we love substituting with spelt.  These pretzels are great.
7369;Omega 3's;I am not fond of the taste, so I put some on my face and body. After it soaks in, my face feels like velvet until the next day.
7370;Like Natural Gas-X;With the consumption of flour threatening my bowels and leaving me a stinky time bomb at the office, I knew there had to be a better way.  Fortunately, Bob found that solution.
7371;OMG!!!!;I just wanted to say that I picked up my first single serving of Primal Spirit Texas BBQ Meatless Vegan Jerky today at my local Home Economist while searching for Gluten Free products (I'm new at this so its an adventure everytime I go into the store!).<br /><br />Now, I am going to say that I am 100% Carnivore!! And I am a absoulte jerky fanatic as I've had it made out of Beef, Deer, Rabbit, Fish, Bison, Buffalo, and even Turkey Jerky!<br /><br />But I can honestly say, this was fantastic! It had a nice stringy texture, like actual meat.
7372;why buy something when you are getting ripped off?;See's makes delicious chocolates
7373;Discolored looking but taste OK;I ordered these Nov 2011, upon arrival I opened them and they had weird white discolration, almost looks like they either went through a melt/freeze cycle or got freezer burnt.  Taste seems ok.
7374;Good Coffee;Good coffee but I definitely prefer the their French Roast.The Italian is not quite as strong as I like it.
7375;Harney and Sonse Pomegranate Oolong Iced Tea;I received this order late (according to the tracking information I received).  Oddly enough, the shipping box arrived in perfect condition, BUT the actual tin that the tea came in was dented.
7376;Tastes Great!;Taste much better than the regular Apple Cider.  I look forward to drinking a cup at night after work.
7377;Great Coffee!;This coffee is great!  What I love is that it has a bold flavor with a clean finish.  Usually I need a breath mint ten minutes or so after drinking a dark coffee, but not with this coffee.
7378;Gross;Tastes like melted plastic.  I will not buy this ever again nor would I recommend it to anyone else.
7379;Delicious homemade popcorn!!!;I bought this to use in my Whirley Pop stovetop popcorn maker a few months ago. This is the best popping oil I have ever used.
7380;Marked right ,wrong size jars.Cheated;I received 16 oz jars instead of 25 oz. just gave them as presents.
7381;Misleading Advertising;I bought these because they advertise this as 100 calories per serving.  Well, there are almost two servings in a bowl which puts this at roughly 200 calories and 40 fat calories.
7382;Wonderful, just wonderful;I received this tea as a gift, it came in a box of ten, assorted flavors. So far I tried the mango peach and sencha and these are both terrific, a light clear taste, not heavy.
7383;Love the taste;I got the dark chocolate cherry cashew, and I just love the taste! It rivals any candy bar. I'm not into candy and am trying to eat clean (Paleo), so thought this would be a nice snack idea for when I'm on the go, etc.
7384;Best salsa ever...Not sweet, just right!;Mrs. Renfro's puts the right amount of peaches to tomatoes and the result is delicious.
7385;I guess it's a good product...;I just couldn't get it down.  It tastes nasty--sort of like grassy dirt but the texture is worse.
7386;too scary for my dog;I was all excited to find a toy that my smart, chew happy dog could play with. What I did not keep in mind, is that she is scared of anything that relates to people, even if it has food in it (she is a shelter rescue).
7387;Just right;This is a delicately flavored, not too sweet treat.  Just the right thing for that mid morning coffe break and indivdully packaged for convenient transportation to work.
7388;Not great;My family and I enjoy the salt & vinegar chips that lays makes as well as the kettle cooked chips, so we wanted to try these chips because we've seen them all over the market. i took a chance and purchased them online on amazon and I regret taking that the chance.
7389;Tasty, but a bit too much splenda for my taste.;These Lipton To Go Stix are small packets of powder which you mix with water to make a green tea beverage.  I tested the Blackberry Pomegranate.
7390;Bland;Expected good, full flavor from this tea, recently having finished 2 packets of Japanese Gyokuro. It is bland, and the color of the steeped tea, an unattractive dark brown - with no hint of green.
7391;My dogs Love Greenies;I have two Boston Terriers and a Terrier mix.<br />They wait in line for these every morning.
7392;yum;taste great..
7393;Made all the difference in the world;From the time my son was 30 hours old, we knew something wasn't right. He began having all sorts of problems that only got worse for the 3 months that I exclusively breastfed him.
7394;Good Stuff;Add 6 oz sausege(already cooked)and the best sausage gravey ever.They quit selling it in the stores but that doesn't mean I'll stop eating this.
7395;4 out of 4 Paws;First Impression: Well the kind folks over at Wellness Pet Food heard about my website and sent me some treats to try! They ended up sending me a big box of their WellBars that have Yogurt, Apples, and Bananas in them. Totally vegetarian, oven baked with lots of vitamins! I'm sure you have read one of my other reviews about Old Mother Hubbard, they make outstanding healthy treats.
7396;Don't waste your money;These were terrible. I do not recommend at all.
7397;Light and tasty;If you appreciate coffee with a social conscience and you want a delicious light blend, this is for you. The little pods are fine for making a 4 oz coffee but anything larger will be too pale for most people's taste.
7398;Love ginger  people ginger chews;These are the best ginger candy.  I was looking for ginger for upset stomach.
7399;The best ramen. Period.;My whole family much prefers this brand of ramen, especially the Miso flavor. If you add some meat, veggies, egg, and etc, one package makes a good meal with enough for two average people or one football player: quite a lot! Absolutely delicious and flavorful, no need to try any other dry brands, IMHO.
7400;Nice to find on line!;The grocery store where I shop discontinued this particular Sun Maid dried fruit mix. My husband loves to have this particular mix on his oatmeal in the morning.
7401;They didn't taste that great...;The price was excellent & I heard many good things about the Kind bars..
7402;Tastes like Koolaid;This tea is good, but nothing amazing, and kind of odd. I use this tea to make iced tea.
7403;One of the safest on the market;Not sure where the other reviewers got their facts, but the latest consumer reports testing shows that the Tropicana apple juice has the lowest levels of arsenic and lead compared to most other juices on the market.  Just google consumer reports apple juice arsenic levels and see the results for yourself.
7404;OK, but lids on few cups were glued on slightly off and they overflowed;
7405;Jello that's good for you;I was recommended to this product by a nutritionist, and have been really happy with it. Make your own gelatin using hot water and fruit juice, no sugar, nothing artificial, tastes great and it's good for you.
7406;Cold brine process produces crisper pickles;Cold brine processing takes longer but makes pickles crisper and crunchier.  Todays mass marketed pickles are produced using heat, which cooks the pickles and makes them soggy.
7407;More healthy than competitive brands;At 110 calories for 8 crackers, this is a healthy (low calorie) snack. I've tried both the Apple Cinnamon and Honey flavors.
7408;Nothing I would buy again...........;A good product but I'll stick with the cheaper dollar store Raman Noodle packages. The noodles were better in the Nong Shim product but, for the price difference, they were not worth the extra cost.
7409;works great for only a few months;The Babycook was instantly one of my new favorite kitchen items when I first began pureeing for my daughter.  It works like it's supposed to.
7410;Off taste, buy a sample first;"As others have said, I find this tea to have an unpleasant off flavor. I am admittedly an ""unsophisticated"" tea drinker."
7411;Positive, glad to find on Amazon;I have used Frontier Broth Powder for years.  It replaces a cabinet full of cans of broth that is practically tasteless or jars of powder that quickly turn into cement.
7412;GREAT STUFF!!!;I just got my 32oz extra virgin coconut oil!! was a bit disappointed..
7413;love it;my baby cant get enough of this milk. we used the powdered version and he will drink it with no problems but once n a while ill give him the liquid n his face just lights up.
7414;My dogs love these;I have two small poodles and they absolutely love these treats..
7415;Very pleasant;"I received this tin in the <a href=""http://www.amazon."
7416;Great puppy food!;My german shepherd puppy loves this food.  It is very soft, so it mixes with her dry food easily.
7417;Greenies pill pockets;This product is great for hiding my cat's thyroid medication.  She is a very picky eater but will take her meds with this product.
7418;Disappointed;I was looking forward to trying this Tahini.  It arrived without damage, however I found the taste to have an underlying bitterness.
7419;excellent tea, packaged with enough tea to last;I have been buying the 40 count Celestial Seasonings Chamomile tea for over 2 years now. Getting 6 boxes at a time also makes my tea experience less of a purchasing hastle.
7420;Market Spice tea is the best ever...;I grew up in Seattle, and drinking Market Spice Tea was one of the treats I enjoyed every time I went to Pike Place Market.  My family has been ordering their tea for years, and we drink it all the time.
7421;My Morning Coffee;As this was an anniversary gift from my husband I was looking forward to the first cup..
7422;I Can't Stop Eating These!... Right Out Of The Box!!!;Having gotten tired of the standard late-night snacks, (popcorn, chips, cookies, etc.) and wanting to watch the amount of fat & calories I take in late at night, I've discovered that cereals can be a very satisfying thing to munch on while sitting in front of the TV.
7423;Yummy and healthy (for packaged food, that is!);I love these! I have a very sensitive gluten allergy, and when I found out all of tasty bite's Indian foods are gluten free (less chance for cross-contamination), I tried these at my supermarket. I felt completely fine after I ate them.
7424;Fantastic;This product is fantastic.  I have had Creme Brulee many times in France and this is just the same!<br />I would recommend it to anyone and my guests have just loved it.
7425;Newton's Fruit Thins;This is a new product made with real fruit.  It is more of a cracker than a cookie and is thin and crispy.
7426;mild but rich;Not much of a description on the box and no instructions, but it's pretty much a tea bag that says this side down.  Let it brew in really hot water for 5 minutes and squeeze it out real good and presto you have easy to make single serve coffee.
7427;Excellent Tea;Well, I am an Earl Grey Fan - I drink 1 cup a day.  I have tried Earl Grey from Tazo, Twinings, Bigelow, etc but this one beats them in taste.
7428;Apple Crisp review;We love apple crisp and are most distressed that Nature Valley quit making them. Please keep them in your stock as long as possible.
7429;Perfect!;I surprised my husband with these cookies.  We donate blood and platelets and these cookies are at our local Red Cross.
7430;Terrible waste of chocolate and raspberry flavors;I LOVE chocolate and adore raspberries (Godiva Dark Chocolate Raspberry Truffles were my idea of heaven).  This coffee has been a major disappointment.
7431;bitter;To me this coffee was extremely bitter.  I dumped it out and made a different cup.
7432;Organic Canned Pumpkin;Item arrived swiftly however, a lot of the cans were dented. If you can live with a dent in your can, the product is perfect inside.
7433;Whole family loves it!;My family believes in an apple a day so this is a great solution when you can't eat fresh. It's so convenient & tastes great.
7434;Well worth the trouble!;I bought these as my boyfriend took a trip to Ireland as a teen and remembers the rashers fondly.  For his birthday I am doing a surprise breakfast party including some of his favorite treats.
7435;Aaaah!;This stuff really worked for my son and for me. A sore throat can be so miserable and sometimes we just get tired of the taste of the numbing spray, but this really gave us a break.
7436;Double Earl Rocks!!!!!;I have tried many brands of Earl Gray tea and  Stash is by far the best. I enjoy several cups a day.
7437;Farmers Organic Canned Pumpkin EXCELLENT PRODUCT;I've purchased the Farmers Organic canned Pumpkin the last few years from our coop & paid up to $32.00 per case.
7438;Inferior to other flavors;It stinks having to adhere to a gluten-free diet.  Granted, a good majority of companies these days are selling an amazingly delicious and varied selection of gluten-free foods.
7439;Tastes great, but doesn't give much of a boost.;Vitamin Squeeze Energy Drink Fruit Punch is probably one of the better-tasting energy drink mixes that I've tried. Where so many really lack in the taste department (so much so that you have to force yourself to drink a lot of them), the Vitamin Squeeze Fruit Punch actually had me coming back for more.
7440;Jamaica Mon;Four and One-Half Stars<br /><br />This coffee's packaging is a send-up of Jamaican style down to its name:  Marley Coffee.  (By the way, I actually saw Bob Marley walking by himself on West 57th Street in the late seventies).
7441;Yummy!;I took a chance and ordered a case of this.  I love tea, but lately I think that it's been a little hard on my liver or something because I have been experiencing some nausea which I have associated with my tea drinking, so I thought maybe ginger tea might work better for me.
7442;Not so good;I had high hopes for this product to work on my yard.  I used other remedies to get rid of the gophers and this was my last resort.
7443;Nice syrup!;Arrived on time with good packaging. Used syrup in my coffee, taste great!  Would recommend Da Vinci French Vanilla Syrup.
7444;coffee lover;"Once again Van Houtte scores as my favorite coffee brand. I usually like flavored coffees but decided to get this for friends and family that want ""real"" coffee."
7445;Quick, light Brown Sauce good for on the GO!;"My family and I travel frequently, and being a retired Chef, I still like to eat well, even on the go! We, my wife, and our twin son and daughter, travel and usually stay in nice ""hotel"" rooms WITH kitchens. So, preparing ""scratch"" sauces on the road is not convenient."
7446;Chicken From China . . . No Thanks!;I wish I had come to the Amazon site before purchasing this product at my local Wegman's. The 'Product Of China' was printed so small it was easy to overlook.
7447;Best diced tomatoes ever!;I really love these hunts diced tomatoes with green peppers, celery and onion. Hunts and Amazon did a good job packaging the cans so that my four cases arrived safely without any severe dents to any of the cans.
7448;I enjoy the Pero Coffe. I used to be a heavy coffe Pero coffe;I used to be a heavy coffe drinker. Several years  ago I had to give it up and switched to Pero - which I was familiar with from Europe.
7449;What this stuff really tastes like...;I love bonito flakes. I'll tell you why - they taste like bacon to me.
7450;Great body wash!;"The most appealing aspect of Men+Care Clean Comfort Body Wash for me is that it manages to avoid the Old Spice/Brylcreme definitions for men's products without sliding down the metrosexual path.  It has a very agreeable scent that I like, and one that met with compliments (or more importantly, a lack of ""what is that."
7451;Loving my bagel thins!;I was so happy to find a good bagel without all the calories, and Bagel Thins get the job done. I especially like the Whole Wheat and Everything with just about anything you can think of on them.
7452;Best crackers for wine!;We encountered these crackers at a few wineries we visited but could never seem to find them. We had to resort to buying online, no problem for Amazon of course.
7453;"Agave ""nectar"" is a scam";from Jonny Bowden, PhD, C.N.
7454;Nice Cup Of Coffee In A Convenient Pack!;I don't drink coffee every day, more like once or twice a week, and when I do I prefer a mild cup of coffee. I like good flavor but not too bold, and not bitter.
7455;What's With the Weird Sensation Seconds After Sipping?;I bought a box of this herbal tea at my local grocery store and highly recommend trying a smaller quantity before committing to 6 boxes of it here.  Although, based on what some other reviewers said, it may be hard to find at local stores.
7456;good buy;It's the same good product I've been buying in one ounce containers, and this amounts to about half price.  I do wonder at the size of the jar, which is only about half full.
7457;works, dog trainer rewiew;This is it, the holy grail of dog powders to convince dogs that they can work!<br />I pour it on dried hotdogs and it works! clients complain that the dogs love me. The dogs love this stuff.
7458;Great for floats, but not as good as A&W;We love our SodaStream and have found several of the mixes we like including the Root Beer.  It is not as good as A&W root beer but it makes a great root beer float.
7459;Great value, you have to use a lot for a strong flavor;I give it five stars for value. True, it's not THE best tea I've ever drunk, but it's pretty darn good.
7460;Where is the Haribo rehab facility!?;I am very aware that I have an addictive personality.  Especially when it comes to sweets!  I remember my Twizzler, Pop Tarts, Peeps and Jelly Fish addictions.
7461;Strong Coffee with a Good Vanilla Flavor;Starbucks Vanilla Flavored Natural Fusions Ground Coffee features Arabica beans from Latin America and all natural flavors.  I first brewed this in an automatic drip coffee maker and awaited the results.
7462;Buonissimo!;Excellent coffee, very smooth yet full bodied flavor. I wish it also came in decaf.
7463;Good Stuff;This stuff is good!!  That's all I have to say.  Rich chocolate, sweet but not overpowering, with a taste of cinnamon and almonds.
7464;Yummy!;Even my husband has become a big fan of poptarts. My kids mention that the unfrosted ones can be a little dry, and that the apple-cinnamon is the best flavor, with blueberry a close second.
7465;Really Good Hot Cocoa - Highly Recommended;These Grove Square Hot Cocoa flavors are by far the best tasting we have found for the Keurig. We took a chance on these due to the high review ratings and it was a pleasant surprise that all three flavors are really good.
7466;sugary, not quite moist sweet-tooth overload;I made it through one bag of these before the typical unconditional happiness of finding another gluten-free option wore off.  These are not quite brownies, more like cookies - though certainly not hard in texture, they are somewhat crumbly, not moist and fudgy.
7467;Great product!;I used these years ago when I was dieting because I like a lot of butter on my veggies!  I couldn't find them when I wanted to watch my calories again, so I checked Amazon and sure enough, there they were.  Still as good as ever!  I wish they'd sell them in smaller quantities, but that's a minor problem.
7468;I hope you like spice.;This pepperoni is chewy and a bit oily-- good if you're into that. It's also got a surprise in the form of a strong paprika aftertaste that kicks in about 10 seconds after you've eaten a piece (or two, or however many you're going to munch on at that instance).
7469;Great snack;These are a great snack to have around the house.  Quick and easy, with the subscribe and save option it is super convenient.
7470;Kcups Green Mountain Dark Magic Extra Bold;If you like a bold coffee that's strong but not bitter, this is the coffee for you.  It has a great full-bodied flavor that's very enjoyable to taste.
7471;Best Tasting Reduced Calorie Kettle Corn;I have tasted nearly every brand of reduced calorie kettle corn on the market and this is by far the best tasting, otherwise, I wouldnt go out of my way to purchase it online. Moreover, my 12 year-old daughter agrees with me-which is a rarity.
7472;Tasty Alternative;This brand of chips has been my favorite since I found them down in Pennsylvania when I used to travel that way.  A few years ago they started to sell them in New England and I was thrilled!  I've been buying them weekly since they made there appearance.
7473;An okay coffee;I bought this to attempt to replace Morning Edition which is no longer available. DH and Mom say it's too bitter to drink.
7474;Would not order again;Was excited to try the Chocolate Banana as I love NuGo bars when the box arrived the chocolate on the bar was discolored and stale tasting. The exp date is 09/01/2011.
7475;A very tasty & attractive gift tower;I sent this as a Fathers Day Gift & the thank you e-mails & calls all said how excited he was & how much he enjoyed it. Every box came with a great assortment of chocolates & the boxes themselves were very pretty.
7476;Tastes like cardboard;This stuff is terrible. I got one for free and couldn't take more than 2 bites before pitching it into the trash.
7477;Caution: Kettle Chips are addictive!;These really are amazing chips. Don't be put off by one of the cheeses being blue cheese.
7478;Good snack!;Have order three boxes in total now. I bring one as a snack to work almost everyday.
7479;Smell is VERY strong;At opening this package the Salmon smell is VERY strong. My son made UGLY faces at first bite.
7480;Dinner Saver;We give this toy with a cup of food in it for our five month old dobie.  It took him a very short time to figure it out, but now knows if he turns it upside down the food comes out.
7481;GREAT;These are great treats. I love that they are not large treats.
7482;My Favorite Tea;Wonderful tea. I think most of the reviewers who hated it already had their own favorite vanilla-nut tea and found this tea different from what they expected?<br /><br />I usually dislike Stash Teas, but this flavor is just so pleasant and homey.
7483;Healthy cheap cereal.;This is one of the healthier cereals you can buy. I wouldn't say it is life changing, but as far as processed grain cereals go this one is both tasty and lower in sugar with some natural fiber.
7484;No sulphur dioxide!;These bars are soooooo good.  My daughter has asthma which can be triggered by sulphur dioxide and these bars don't use this chemical to preserve the dried fruit.
7485;best flavored coffee;This coffee is the best.  Vanilla and rum combine to make your regular cup of joe even better.
7486;Great coffee, but don't buy it online.;I have always loved Illy, and bought two cans at Christmas for delivery with a bunch of other Amazon orders.  I did it purely for the convenience of not having to pick up coffee to take to my holiday destination.
7487;grey poupon;Anyone remember that old joke about Grey Poupon that involved two old sophisticated men in a limousine?  I remember that commercial with fond memories, and in fact is the main reason I avoided eating it for so long for fear that I'd become exactly like those men.  Good thing it was just a big joke and *anyone* can eat this stuff without desiring to feel high and mighty!<br /><br />The taste is good but it's not as appealing as it used to be.
7488;Great Product, great training aid;I got the Lickety Stik through the Vine Program.  I was a little skeptical upon ordering.
7489;Didn't receive what I ordered;I ordered the Teenie pack of Greenies that was supposed to come with 96 teenie sized chews. I ended up receiving a pack with 52 teenie sized chews and 8 large chews.
7490;It may be good if it wasnt so stale....;This coffee looked like a good deal and had some good reviews but dont be deceived!  I think this particular bag of coffee I got had to have sat in the warehouse for at least a year.  The beans, when ground, go to dust instantly.
7491;Pattid;This house blend is one of the best coffees.  I have tried a wide variety of k-cup coffees and the House Blend is the best.
7492;A delicious winter treat!;When I first ordered this Cider, I wasn't expecting it to be great, based on some of the reviews. Since it is priced so low, I thought I would give it a whirl and expand the use of my Keurig brewer.
7493;"Love these noodles.  I'm using the word ""love"" here.";I've lost track of how many of these packages I've eaten in my lifetime.  Mom would make these for us for lunch as kids growing up, sometimes embellishing them with chopped green onions, soy sauce, or bits of cooked egg.
7494;Healthy, but nothing more;This tree was absolutely nothing as pictured. It has horrible qualities for bonsai, even as a place to start.
7495;Good Stuff;These are great for on the go..
7496;Newman's Own Organics Dog Food;I cannot express enough how pleased I am with this dog food. I feed my 11 year old German Shepard, and my two year old Pittie Girl this food every day, and the benefits are astounding.
7497;My cats love this.;My cats are on a diet of super high quality dry food, but once a day I split up a pouch of Whiskas Purrfectly Fish or Chicken between them.<br /><br />They love it.
7498;Topping;It is as close to theatre topping as it could be.  Good taste, good flavor A+ in my book or should I say on my popcorn.
7499;Great 70% dark chocolate;I have been sampling a number of 70% dark chocolate bars recently and this is as good as any I have tasted, plus it is organic.  However I would urge anyone who wants to try this product to check your local grocer first.
7500;Addictive;These are the best potato chips I've ever tasted.  It's easy to go through half of a bag without stopping.
7501;Fantastic rice!;Not ever trying this rice before made me a little hesitant when I was ordering it. However, this rice is fantastic!!! It did not come with directions for the rice cooker, but as that is how I do all of our rice, I jumped in.
7502;2 bags - 2 different assortments;I ordered 2 bags of the flops.  I did get one bag that was mainly brown, white, and green flops.
7503;Delicious Flavored Snow Cones;Hawaiian Shaved Ice Company rules the shaved ice/snow cone business! Fast shipping and a variety of flavors to die for. These syrups are wonderful with strong, tasty flavors, not some watered down supermarket syrup that you can't taste after a minute or two.
7504;Fantastic Coffee;LOVE IT ! order it on a regular basis. Great bargain, great coffee.
7505;Best Snack Food Ever;Full of flavor, good for you and less calories then 3 potato chips. This snack fulfills all the requirements of snack food.
7506;The best gummy bears out there..;These don't last long when I order them. Nice and soft, chewy, flavorful.
7507;Tasty!;Unlike other reviewers, I really liked the sauce. Yes, it's a little sweet, but I'm a big Jalapeno fan, so I think it's great.
7508;Not very good;"My wife and I love caramel flavored coffee, and this just doesn't cut it.  Perhaps it's the ""truffle"" aspect of the coffee?  I'm not sure, but whatever it is, we ended up throwing it out after 1 pot."
7509;Top of the line green tea;My absolutely favorite green tea - at least of those available in tea bags. The sachets are great for larger mugs.
7510;relaxing, almost like something you smoke;Couldn't believe it when told how relaxing this beverage was. Seriously, drink it only if you are getting ready for a nap or bedtime.
7511;couldn't fing the green chai;I prefer the Stash green chai but amazon did not have free shipping on it and it was pricey so I got this instead.  It's good but not as good as the green.
7512;Great tea for weight loss! One of the ONLY ones I have found that actually works!;Wonderful tea, it really supresses the appetite!  I love the packaging also.  I would highly recommend as a weight loss tea as I have tried many out there that claim to be such and are not.
7513;My favorite tea;I don't even really like tea much but this tea is amazing. I love it.
7514;goodeats;[..
7515;teen loved it;Son found this in the snacks over the summer and enjoyed it.  It was nice to have the product individually packaged so that you could enjoy just a little at a time.
7516;Very Good, Fresh, Tasty;I like to munch on these when I just HAVE to have a snack, but don't need extra fat and calories.  I've ordered several flavors from Amazon and this vendor, and have been pleased with all of them.
7517;Cutie Pie;Our cat just loves her tuna flakes.  She has them everyday.
7518;Awesome combination of spices;These spices give the perfect flavor to any kind of salad, especially tuna and chicken.  They can even be added to sour cream to create the perfect dip.
7519;Good coffee, but....;This is good, flavorful coffee, but just not quite the right blend for me.<br />There are others I like more, so will not be ordering it again.
7520;Great toy for an energetic dog;I was looking for a durable toy that would hold the interest of my 5 month old Border Aussie puppy and the Tug-a-Jug has been a great find. He was a little hesitant of it at first but once he figured out that the toy dispensed food, he is having a great time figuring out different ways of getting his kibble to come out.
7521;Superbly Refreshing;I drink water from my jug as I work through long days, and I love water so much, I usually drink more from a glass when I get home as well. Water is my drink of choice.
7522;I LOVE this product, but don't buy it here....;I agree with all the reviews about the price. It's really ridiculous that the appeal of this machine for our family was the cost of soda vs.
7523;glutino products are the best;glutino pretzels are fresh tasty and best gluten free foods you can ever buy. i recomend this product for all who need to keep wheat away from their diet.
7524;wonderful  pasta;I have ordered this pasta and various other things from Amazon before and have always been very happy with the prompt service and conditions of the products.<br /><br />I will definetly be ordering again.
7525;good and healthy;PB & Co makes some of the best peanut butters.  All have their place.
7526;CeeJay;I love the Green Mountain brand of coffee and the Nantucket Blend is one of my favorites.<br />This is an excellent one to buy if you appreciate a true cup of coffee.
7527;Even my VERY Fussy Eater likes this!;"I have a VEEEEERRY fussy 2 year old Ragdoll cat who cannot eat dry food (it makes him throw up) and he hates most all canned foods.  (And I know, because I have tried them all!)  Thankfully, I found this food before he starved to death!!!  He really likes it -- he will even lick the bottom of his bowl clean (and he NEVER did that before!)  The food is not pate' style -- it is actually soft, moist little ""rectangle"" shapes of food in a light sauce/gravy."
7528;No Taste;This tea does not have any taste! I grew up drinking linden flower tea, but this one tastes like nothing more than warm water. We even tried to combine it with other teas, to no avail.
7529;its nice but can be hotter;"to be honest this is the spiciest hot sauce i've used in a very long time, however the ""heat"" goes away after a minute or so and its almost mind numbingly bearable. it's good with soup! 1 drop however is not sufficient, 12-15 is a good measure in my opinion."
7530;Puppy Loves Them!;We got a new puppy and wanted to give him a healthy treat for training..
7531;OK, nothing special;I like that it doesnt have high fructose sugar in it, but they weren't as big of a hit as I thought they'd be.  My kids would rather have a juice box.
7532;Excellent mild Indian sauce for meat, tofu, vegetables, noodles;I absolutely love this sauce. It is rather mild and not full of heat, but it is full of flavor.
7533;Greatest since stuffed peppers;I am not, repeat, a tea drinker.  My youngest son talked me into trying some Mugicha Tea at our Family Christmas get-to-gether.
7534;McVities Digestive Biscuits with good packagining;This is one of my favorite biscuits. The batch I received had best before date after only 4 months.
7535;"Tasty flavorful cereal that is also probably ""healthy""";Not to get into a health debate so I'll just describe the cereal.<br /><br />You have your classic Special K crunchy flakes with a great taste of vanilla and almond.
7536;Good stuff, Hard to find;I use this as a base for some exotic Italian seafood dishes, It has wonderful flavor, but don't expect any lobster meat in there, it's just flavored that way, I've been using this for 40+ years and Amazon was the only place I could find it anymore without breaking the bank for shipping. In fact I think I need to order another case of it.
7537;Green Mountain Coffee, Dark Magic k-cup;I've been drinking this for quite awhile now and have not been disappointed.  If you like a strong cup of coffee, I think you will like this.
7538;So tasty and good for you too!;The whole family loves these crackers.  Good price here too.
7539;Quick & easy;Lipton pasta sides are among my family's favorite side dishes, and I certainly don't mind the quick and easy preparation.  The cheddar flavor is a bit bland, and not as cheesy as the product description and picture would make it sound.
7540;Yummy!;I thought this product was great. In fact I'm about to order some more.
7541;Where's the Chocolate?;My favorite candy as an adolescent was every flavor of Bonomo Turkish Taffy!  I've waited literally years for it to be re-introduced.  I'm a little disappointed.
7542;Muscavado sugar;This is my first time using muscavado sugar and I've been very impressed with the taste.  I've used it to bake with and it gives things a much better flavor than regular sugar.
7543;Pancake Syrup;This was my first time ordering Walden Farms Syrup.  I've used many of their other products.
7544;tasty and so easy;While the restaurants always do it best, these curry pastes are pretty tasty. It's easy to use,  fast, and you can add the meat and veggies of your choice.
7545;Multi-Use!;Coconut oil is not widely known for its health benefits (at least in the US) so I am trying to spread the word.  It is great for cooking as a vegetable oil substitute and butter substitute in many recipes.
7546;Great product;This cereal is very hard to find in grocery stores and thanks to Amazon my daughter always has it. It is very nutritious, tastes great and is easily digestable for babies.
7547;Don't waste your money!;Tea is great but the k-cup design is terrible.  Just finished my 1st box of 12 and had 33% waste.
7548;Quite Frankly The Best Tea Ever! Mighty Leaf Pear Caramel.;I am not an avid tea drinker and I don't go for the green teas..
7549;Sweet, salty, tangy: the way a snack should be;Kettle brand chips are probably the best potato chips I've tasted thus far. They are thick, has a bite to them and I love their creative flavors.
7550;Great alternative to regular milk;This product, the regular ORIGINAL kind - no special flavor
7551;Best Chamomile Tea;This is my favorite tea. This is the main tea I turn to to serve guests.
7552;GREAT;We order this popcorn for our nastalgic popper all the time.  It has always been fresh and few kernals go unpopped.
7553;GREAT Baby/ TODDLER FOOD!!!!!! for my picky eater;I can't say enough goodness about this produc. The taste, texture is great for my toddler.
7554;Extremely Sweet;Previous reviewers have stated that muffins prepared from this product are not too sweet.  I found the exact opposite.
7555;Quality dog food, but he still can't have it...;For about three months we were feeding this formula and the Senior formula to our 18-year-old Gilligan, mainly because he has a very long list of health issues that we try to sidestep like landmines and I strongly believe the prescription foods sold at the vet office are nothing but crap.  I have researched and studied dog foods for several years now and although I believe Canidae is one of better foods out there, Gilligan began having seizures just weeks after he begun eating it and we now home cook his meals.
7556;Sweet Tea, Sweet Taste;I had already tried the mango peach flavor MIO and loved that.  The Sweet Tea delivers the same punch.
7557;Tasty, easy to prepare;These Maruchan Four Cheese noodles are delicious! By themselves, they are a bit bland. I think adding your own extras such as cooked chicken, ham and/or vegetables is the way to go for a more complete meal rather than a quick snack.
7558;Love Veranda;It's a nice, smooth blend and makes for a great morning cup of joe. I enjoy this every morning while reading the news before going to work.
7559;Mac an' cheese = mac an' cheeese;"Well mac and cheese, basically is just that.  A fun filled load of ""filling"" ""pasta and chemicals that our kids loved and now our granddaughter also loves it."
7560;little bambinos;Tried the popcorn on my little bambino popper machine . I am very happy with the results .
7561;GOOD  Stuff Mate  !;I love  Darrell Lea Licorice i do like the Mango and green apple a lot because it is different from your everyday<br />red or black licorice..
7562;depending on your cat i guess;i know of one cat who craved this product..
7563;Organic Grape Seed Oil;I really like the quality of this grape seed oil. The price was good, the shipping was fast and I have used it a lot in making my essential oil blends.
7564;Good breakfast;I am not lactose tolerant so I can't have milk with my cereal. That said this is just about the perfect balance of sweetness and fiber to eat without milk.
7565;Great treat for you dog while improving their tooth health;Greenies are a great product that dogs love and while they are enjoying their daily treat, they are actually keeping their teeth  and gums clean.  I always share the information on Greenies when people ask how I keep my 6 year old Yellow Labradors teeth so clean.
7566;Love Savon Et Cie Green Tea Soap;Received my first bar of Savon about 3 years ago, a gift from my son. Have been using ever since.
7567;Death Rain;This is an excellent bag of chips!  I bought two cases and shared them with the folks at work.  Everyone is raving about level of heat.
7568;Best instant ever;I never like instant anything until I tried this oatmeal, a co-worker ordered it but didn't want it
7569;tea4me;Great tea. Like dessert in a cup.
7570;Nephew and his family loved these;My nephew's little girls loved these pretty cakes. They arrived just after Christmas, which was an extra treat for the family.
7571;Watch Out Whole Foods;The chips are great, with a family of seven the only shelf life I worry about is keeping them there.  Really though, did you see the price?  Like $1.
7572;YUK;I was expecting a mango/peach flavor with the coconut water but what I got was a musty aftertaste. I was very disappointed given my love for the original plain flavor.
7573;my favorite flavor;Arrived in two plastic bags inside a box. I found the tootsie pops to be great, not perfect, but pretty close.
7574;I wouldn't buy again but it depends on one's preferences;I like Bugles, but I didn't like the overall result with this particular version.  I was put off by the rather icky pasty coating of chocolate and peanut butter that covers each Bugle piece.
7575;K-cups coffee..;Timothy's Italian roast is a mild not bold coffee..
7576;Evangers dog food;Great product! This dog food has a very healthy rating from professional canine associations..
7577;Lavazza Crema e Gusto Ground Coffee, Italian Espresso, 8.8-Ounce Bricks;If you are avid coffee espresso drinker look no further. This coffee comes perfectly pre-ground for espresso drinks.
7578;Great milk product.;"<a href=""http://www.amazon."
7579;Salty;This product is much too salty.  If you have medical issues that require low or no sodium, this is not right for you.
7580;biscotti from Amazon;Good flavor and texture. Individual wrapped, stays fresh for 3 or more months.
7581;Top Quality Olive Oil;I love olive oil, and it's hard to find such high quality oil anywhere for this reasonable price. Highly recommend.
7582;Ugh.;I'm not vegan or vegetarian, but I don't have an issue eating vegan friendly foods. I picked up the Dr.
7583;happy pair;My pair of cats, old and young are lovers of Temptations. They like the Seafood medley flavor.
7584;If you like Slim Jim you won't like this;I purchased this because I had cravings for Slim Jims and read a review claiming that these were similar to Slim Jim. Well, I just received it and after one bite I realized these were NOTHING like Slim Jim.
7585;Odd Taste;Very thin consistency. About the same as corn syrup.
7586;B L E N D.....O F......W H A T....... ?_?_?_?_?_?_?;"When I first bought Nestle (Nescafe) Mountain Blend Coffee, (with the extra smooth taste), several years ago, I thought that the ""blend"" in the name referred to several different types of mountain-grown coffee.  Silly me!  The ""blend"" herein is instant coffee mixed with another, NON-COFFEE ingrediewnt!  It's been several years since I bought this coffee, and I'm not near a supermarket, so I can't give you the name of the other ingredient."
7587;Great tasting sugar free item;This item is very similar to the regular version. You will need to limit yourself to 3-6 pieces
7588;Good;If you are used to diet products this is good. However, there is very little flavor.
7589;STONEWALL POPOVER MIX;Why struggle making popovers from scratch when Stonewall's Povover Mix (with my help) produces wonderful,<br />delicious delights !!!!!!!!  I would have given it a 5-Star rating if I didn't have to divide the package<br />in two.  Popover pans usually have six cups, but Stonewall's package has enough mix for twelve.
7590;Orange?;This is an OK tasting dark chacolate, however I was not able to either taste or smell any orange. It would benefit from a touch more stevia and some orange rind.
7591;Tasty and easy;"I remember the old Shake N Bake commercial from when I was a kid (""It's Shake N Bake, and I helped!"") and was curious to try it again.  My sample pouch had enough to coat 6 boneless pork chops, each almost a half inch thick."
7592;Terrible Dog Toy;I was so excited to get this toy for my 7 month old yellow lab.  When it arrived I filled it with kibble and soon discovered that this is the worst toy ever.
7593;Horrible: did something happen?;I bought this coffee because several people who also liked my favorite (Jet Fuel or Emeril's Big Intense Bold) liked this one. Typically Sumatra is one of my favorite coffees as well.
7594;Ehh....I could have matched the bouquet better if I'd have done it myself.;"I ordered the large version of Fields of Europe, the orange rose version. While the flowers are ""close"" I really didn't want pink roses."
7595;Honestly...;Once you make these, you won't ever eat chickpeas from a can again. Ever.
7596;Mud?;"This is some of the worst coffee I have ever tasted. The other Caribou styles are tolerable, some even decent, but ""Daybreak"" was just nasty."
7597;Fantastic bars;These bars are my favorite. Everyone else in the office love them too.
7598;Huge disappointment for the price;I received the box, which contained--to my surprise--three spots with the rest spacers for the tomatoes. At a price of $19.
7599;Satisfied this vegan chocoholic!;I've tried a few types of vegan chocolate chip cookies and was always disappointed with how bland they were--and loaded with fat and calories.  These are not only the least amount of calories that I've seen for a vegan cookie of this size, but I found that these double chocolate chip cookies were better than the non-vegan ones I've had in the past!  They are so, so, so good.
7600;HAVE A CHERRY COKE;"Had serious fall, knees my doctor said I had footall knees, and 15 years ago wanted to give me ""knew knees"" -- no thanks.  But, I heard of this Tart Cherry juice, and after serious fall ---I tried it - it is not my imagination, each day my knees begin to work again, NO PAIN -- sometimes when standing up."
7601;wish I'd started using it 5 years ago;I have two litter mates.  One can eat anything with no problem.
7602;Vegan Natural Choice;Vegan. Natural.
7603;Great flavor, convenient delivery!;My husband and I tried this tea when visiting family in Florida.  This was probably the best sweet tea that I've tried that was both sweet enough for my husband yet not overly sweet to me.
7604;Love this product;I wanted a good formula to switch on for my son because he needed a supplment between nursing so I was very happy to find something not made in china and was organic.  Love this product.
7605;Delicious and healthy!;I am not always sold on Kashi products because some just taste a little too healthy for me (even though I do like to eat healthy).  This bar is delicious however.
7606;Good for you!;I really love the Vanilla Hemp Protein powder. It doesn't have a very strong vanilla taste, but it helps mask the super nutty flavor otherwise.
7607;Pleasantly surprised!;Expecting just a quick cup of coffee with limited flavor I was impressed with the quality of these K-cups.  Great flavor, bold and if you like your coffee strong, you will not be disappointed.
7608;kind of salty and dry, but a good crunch if you are carbo craving;"These are very salty, and the nacho flavor on ""just cheese"" seems kind of redundant. The quantity in the bag is very scant."
7609;Great treat for training!!!!;These treats are the best.  I use them for training my dog and my cat begs for the salmon ones!! Regarding the comment about the treats hardening.
7610;Solid?;"The can of Starkist ""Solid White Albacore"" I opened looked more like ""Chunk Light"" tuna, with random bits of fish and other dark fish parts that one doesn't normally associate with ""solid white albacore.""  In all my other experiences of eating solid white albacore from other brands, the can usually contains a ""solid"" piece of fish from one part of the fish, not chunks and bits from who knows where."
7611;Old Merchandise;I ordered four containers and two were fine, but the other two were not. The bad treats had  a greasy coat on the sticks and when I tried to split the treats in half, they crumbled and fell apart.
7612;Not impressed.;I didn't really enjoy this one. I tried the Hazelnut from a couple of different companies and this one was definitely not the best.
7613;Best Ginger tea on the market;For those who love the flavor of ginger tea, this can't be beat. Its 100% pure ginger, brews up with quickly (1 bag will even manged two mugs worth), and gives a clean pallet cleansing flavor.
7614;tiamisu flavored coffee;This coffee is delicious and it arrived very quickly.  I am very happy with this product.
7615;THE BEST BABY CEREAL EVER!!!!;I would give it more stars if I could.  Our first baby absolutely loved it when he was younger, and it is extremely good for the baby with all of the different nutrients that the baby needs.
7616;very elegant gift;bought this for my mom who has every thing..
7617;tomatoe soup for gluten untolerant!;Soup was delicious. No complaints at all except for the price.
7618;It Goes Down Smooth;Timothy's World Coffee Extra Bold Rainforest Expresso, is a very smooth and flavorful coffee to drink anytime of the day or night.  I switch between this and Timothy's Midnight Magic (which is another outstanding bold coffee).
7619;Exactly what I expected.;This is your basic Easy Mac.  I actually prefer this packaging over the version that comes with its own little bowl.
7620;Expensive but fun;"I feel I was misled about the ""1 lb. shipping weight""."
7621;An excellent supplement!;This is the best magnesium supplement. Highly effective and absorbable.
7622;Oregon Chai Original Tea;This is my favorite morning drink.  The price is so much better on line @ Amazon.
7623;Fantastic;An incredibly delicious hot cocoa.  Rich, deep chocolate flavor and for a very low calorie count.
7624;Happy Gardener!;I purchased 2 of these jars for use in my garden. I plant many bulbs every Fall, but only half of the bulbs survive the onslaught of the squirrels! Faced with spending ever increasing amounts of money on more and more bulbs, I decided to fight back.
7625;Boxed Dinner- without the chemicals!!!;This was a great deal- it is difficult to find this particular choice in most of our grocery stores and in the few that offer it..
7626;A dark, bold roast that is a welcome start to the day;"Noted as a ""West Coast Favorite"" this dark roast conjures up a scent of pine needles for me as it brews, a subliminal association perhaps tied more to the blend's name than the actual aromatics, which are pleasantly thick, sweet and strong enough to lift me from a groggy morning.<br /><br />I am still partial to Green Mountain Coffee Nantucket Blend, a recent purchase that knocked my socks off."
7627;Delicious, healthy breakfast.;This is a staple in our house - we have it every weekday for breakfast. I make the oatmeal in a rice cooker, on a porridge cycle that's programmed to finish at 6 am, when we get up.
7628;Awesome and last forever(ish);I'm buying 2 new sproutbags today, and I prefer this kit to getting just the bag for about the same cost. I wouldn't even be in the market, but I ruined the bag I've had for 3 years by soaking it in a rusty metal tin on accident.
7629;Excellt BBQ Sauce;I purchased this sauce in a foo foo shop for home decorating.  Excellent.
7630;We love this product;We've been using Calm for a few months now and have a couple extra containers available.  Recommend it for those who get constipated (sorry about that) and for an overall feeling of calm.
7631;Very healthy, great product;This is a great product. We love it.
7632;No Imposters Here!;These are the real deal.  I was blown away that these tasted EXACTLY like the Haribos with sugar.
7633;Great Tea;This tea is great. My husband doesn't like tea but he loves this like me.
7634;Delicious;I like all of the Food Should Taste Good varieties that I have tried (Multigrain, Jalapeno, Sweet Potato, and Olive). They are delicious, but also low sodium, all natural, and vegan.
7635;Dog really likes, but they go fast.;I have an 11 pound Couton De Tulear.  Small sharp teeth.
7636;creamer;If you like Amaretto this is the creamer for you. The taste is not overpowering and not too sweet.
7637;Fast delivery;The package arrived way before I expected it. It was well packed.
7638;Fun drink, but expensive;"The taste instantly reminded me of my last cruise, sitting on the pool deck and drinking a fruity alcoholic ""drink of the day"".  Basically, it tastes good and is not hard to get down or anything like that."
7639;Nice bold taste;My partner was getting distressed with the lack of taste in her K-cup coffee (my bad, since I'm the one who buys the coffee), and she requested something with a bolder taste. So, I tried this.
7640;Good smooth coffee for the right machine;My husband and I both enjoyed this coffee, it was smooth and easy to drink. I especially enjoyed it with a little bit of almond milk, it was perfect.
7641;No wonder The Queen likes this mustard ...;This is deluxe mustard. Unlike some American brands, you can't get carried away with Colman's or you'll get a really hot mouth and might shed a few tears.
7642;Newman's Own Organics Dark Chocolate Bar;I am a big fan of the Newman's Own products, and especially the Organics line -and a decent fan of dark chocolate as well :), but I would have liked this bar more if the cocoa content was higher than 54%.  I found the taste to be comparable to some other 65-70% cocoa bars (not too sweet-not too bitter).
7643;Great Olive Oil Product;This is very high quality olive oil for the price.  Nice flavor and color.
7644;Great Product!!;If you like tang or orange kool-aid then you will love this product. I even like it better when I double the amout of powder, makes a better orange flavor.
7645;Cats love it;After one of my cats experienced some tummy problems, I decided to look for some grain free options.  My cats love this stuff.
7646;Different Consistency;We have 6 cats and 2 dogs presently and they all get Newman's Own Organics.  The only one we have had our cats walk away from is the 3 oz can of Turkey Formula for cats.
7647;Great Tasting Tea;I love green tea. This brand is delicious i just wish it came in decaf.
7648;nice drink;I enjoyed this drink. Its nice to have the packets in my purse that I can ad to water at work.
7649;Once Great Snack Gives Cardboard a Bad Name;At one time this was my favorite guilty pleasure. Sadly, there's nothing left to enjoy in these dry, flavorless packing peanuts.
7650;Get What You pay for!!!!;The price was cheap & so was the product. These rawhide bones literally disinegrated into a thousand small shards, occasionally causing my Golden to gag on them.
7651;What a real treat ! ! !;These cookies are some of the best I have ever tried. It takes me back to when I was a kid and there were cookies that were similar with the marshmallow, etc.
7652;K-9 Glucosamine Joint Formula;Excellent product!  I have used K-9 Liquid Health products in the past and think they are some of the best out there.  The advantage of using liquids rather than pill, they are quickly absorbed and especially convenient if you have a dog or cat that refused pills.
7653;Strong and bitter;Does not mix well at all, lots of nasty sediment at bottom of cup. Bitter and burnt tasting as with most starbucks coffees.
7654;Delicious Snack;I recently received one of these bars in my VoxBox for review purposes and really quite enjoyed it. I am not a banana person at all but like almonds so figured I would test it out and am glad I did.
7655;Messy and no odor control;This is the worst cat litter I've ever used. It left a mess, both on my floor and into the other room.
7656;Tasty !;These were spicy, as in hot. Also had good curry flavor.
7657;Not So Xtreme;"My cat recently freaked out over some catnip that came with a bed I bought him so I thought I'd order some more.  I couldn't find the same brand but this ""Xtreme"" catnip sounded like it might do the trick."
7658;Delicious!;I have only used this product to make my peanut butter smoothies. My husband loves pb smoothies but was skeptical about trying this powdered version.
7659;Good noms;Chocolate is by definition a Good Thing, dark chocolate doubly so.  And organic, Rainforest Alliance Certified dark chocolate?  Very nice.
7660;Great Concept;The antler we received is larger than I expected -- too big/heavy for my mini schnauzer, but would be great for a lab or boxer sized dog.  The good/bad thing about this chew is that it's sterile
7661;My picky & spoiled dogs love these!!!;I found these at Marshall's, so I decided to give them a shot.  It seems everytime I find something my dogs like it gets discontinued, but I got lucky this time.
7662;Peanut Butter and Dark Chocolate Joy;"I am new to the ""Kind"" family of products and ordered these bars after talking with a friend.  WOW!  These are amazing!  They serve as a total meal replacement when I'm on the go, but still taste good enough to be considered a snack."
7663;I wish they tasted like Grilled Cheese;"I've been looking for a natural cheese puff that did not have all the additives and preservatives in it to make one's stomach upset.<br /><br />I thought I found the right product with ""Snikiddy Snacks Grilled Cheese Puff""."
7664;My favorite taste;I no longer have to spend $5 for a cup of coffee at Starbucks at the corner.  I've tried several flavor and this is my favorite.
7665;Delicious!;This is great tomato soup with a definite, but not overpowering flavor of basil, and a consistency that's not too thick or thin.  Although I enjoy this simply as-is (goes GREAT with Ritz crackers), I usually add quinoa, brown rice, whole wheat pasta or cubed potatoes for a nutritious, filling dish that serves as my lunch or sidedish at dinner.
7666;Doesn't taste as good as it sounds;I love white teas and have really enjoyed experimenting with different flavors through Teavana.  Youthberry, White Ayurvedic Chai and Spice of Life are a few of my favorites.
7667;Hello Soft Beautiful Hair and Goodbye Dry, Itchy Scalp...;I have been using this conditioner for a week now and I think it works really well.  My normally dry, itchy hair & scalp feels much healither & softer now.
7668;Gives Lentil soup a bad name;I would put this in the category of barely edible.  The soup was bland and what flavor there was was not a good one.
7669;Graham Sticks;When my favorite local grocery store was purchased by a larger chain, they did not continue to carry these
7670;YUCK;I bought this product, based on many positive reviews, and was not satisfied. I got the original flavor, which I followed the directions while preparing it.
7671;a review from Trixie the Wondercat as told to her person....;I had been told that finally the day would come when my own package from amazon would come and today it finally came. What was in the box was basically the winnings from some cat lottery.
7672;Delicious!;I add black sesame powder into my bowl of quick oat to create a healthy and delicious breakfast.  The black sesame powder sold in the market normally contains added sugar, but these are just pure sesame powder.
7673;What a deal, it's organic;Great tasting raw cacao powder.  It's not the same as a chocolate powder, you need to add a sweetner otherwise it's too bitter.
7674;Emeril's Jazzed up decaf...good, but...;Emeril's Jazzed up Decaf is a great flavored decaf..
7675;Love me some gluten free bisquick!!!;We just bought this the other day because for about 2 years we have found that biscuits are a very hard wheat/gluten free item to make..
7676;Great gluten-free brownies!;I just went GF about three months ago and I am slowly researching different mixes to find what I like best.  This happened to be the first mix we picked up at Whole Foods, and my husband (who is not GF) loved them just as much as I did.
7677;Yummy!!!;I normally do not like any type of cereal bar.  These however are wonderful!  A champion body building health nut friend of mine gave me one of these once.
7678;Best sauce in a jar;I bought a jar of this arrabiata sauce in my local supermarket.  It's the best commercial sauce from a jar, at least that I've ever come across.
7679;Seeds of Change S10810 Certified Organic Italian White Eggplant;I come from a family of professional gardeners and I cannot grow plants to save my life. These seeds however did get started and actually grew a few inches.
7680;Maybe my favorites...;I am French so I have known the Michoko candies for a very long time. I actually grew up eating some when having a treat.
7681;VB;The item was not fresh although the expiration date was for 1 week ahead of scheduled time. I would not order this again.
7682;Need to coax dog to eat it, but had no problem switching;My dog, a half Yorkie half Bichon, recently decided to start being picky about her food.  I tried taking it away when she would it etc, but then she'd end up eating only half her food in a day, and after several days of that (and several months of trying other techniques to get her to eat), I gave up and finally switched foods.
7683;ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS!;I am 65 years old and have always been very fussy about my mayonnaise. I live in California and my favorite has always been Kraft.
7684;Malt Powder at it's best;Expensive, but a lot better than any store bought powder.  As a person who makes REAL Malts on a regular basis, I know a good tasting malt when I see one.
7685;Great coffee but very pricey;Ordered this product without reading what i was getting ..
7686;Rodeo Drive - delicious coffee;I love quite a few coffees but this one is grabbing my whole households attention. It's not bitter but it's not light either.
7687;Perfect training treat!!;This treat amazing for training!<br /><br />I'm writing this in regards to my 5 month old puppy, somewhat food motivated, and my 12 year old lab mix, extremely food motivated.  I can't say how the treats would do for a very fussy dog.
7688;Not the flavors advertised;I returned 2 cartons of these that were the standard variety flavors sold as the fun flavor assortment. It seems this is a common problem.
7689;Beggin' Strips, Bacon;My dogs love the Beggin' Strips, which is a special treat for them. Normally don't buy this item because of the expense, but your price was so reasonable.
7690;splenda NO calorie sweetener....hazelnut;Excellent in your coffee, great flavor, not too strong and sugar free..
7691;Delish and Healthy;Searched long and hard for a protein shake that didn't have artificial ingredients (aspartame). Have tried this flavor and Choc.
7692;Great product.;this is a great product,it helps to relieve my bloating.I will order it again.
7693;DISAPPOINTING!!;WHEN THEY CALL IT BREAD THEY ARE TELLING THE TRUTH..
7694;Perrrrrrrfect!;"In one word: WOW!!<br /><br />THANK YOU BETTY CROCKER!!! This cake mix finally makes it easy to create a dessert that is completely delicious and presentable to guests with full assurance there won't be a crumb remaining on the plate! Try it with <a href=""http://www.amazon."
7695;Try them in your cooking!;This is either a new adventure or an all-new low - reviewing a snack on Amazon.com.
7696;Healthy and tasty!;I have tried original, BBQ and salt and vinegar. They all they good, the BBQ is the most flavorful.
7697;too much of a good thing;These chips are very spicy to say the least, my tongue burned too much to finish the small individual serving bag. They have an overpowering amount of some Asian spice, perhaps ginger, but it is way too strong and you are left with a very unpleasant taste.
7698;Smells and looks like the 'non special diet', but cats won't eat it;My cats love the regular version of this flavor. One of them got crystals when we switched their dry food, so she had to be put on special food for that.
7699;Excellent;I am no expert in cooking or baking supplies, but this marzipan is really good! Soft and moist and absolutely delightful in taste. Not too sweet nor too bland - 380 Calories per bar (220 fat calories).
7700;This tea is the Bomb dot Com!!!;One word:  YUM!!  I will never drink coffee again. It is subtle, refreshing and benefecial to your health.
7701;Excellent!;"Excellent.  If you remember the ""Forever Yours"" bar, this is the same thing only from Milky Way."
7702;Slightly acidic, not for me...;The price is great but I just didn't like the taste of this coffee. I'm pretty picky about coffee and love to drink strong.
7703;Annie Chun's noodles best on the market;benefits from buying this brand:  made in USA, all natural ingredients, cooks in 1 minute, many varieties of flavors to choose from.  Even the cooking bowl is bio-degradable, so doesn't harm the environment.
7704;Great Tasting;I bought a box of these as a special.  Sure glad I bought when I did as the price went up drastically.
7705;Great instant espresso;I never could have imagine that  the espresso coffee could be so good<br />instant, Is the best I have ever tasted. All my family enjoyed it since the first cup.
7706;Perfect!;My husband and I use about 4 k cups a day, sometimes a little less or a little more, give or take. I was looking for something that is compact and holds a lot because of my limited counter space.
7707;Plain and simple: awesome;this is really awesome tasting stuff. I really think they are pretty awesome as in i got them for my girl friend and she ate most of them (1 bag that day).
7708;made my dog sick...;The treats were very hard. My dog still seemed to enjoy them so I continued to feed them to her little bits at a time.
7709;Delicious at a good price and fast shipping!;I've loved Caribou Coffee's Caribou Blend ever since my parents got me a Keurig for my birthday a year ago with a sampler of coffees to go with it.  Caribou was my favorite next to Newman's but I find the prices at some places rather off-putting.
7710;Better for medium/large dogs;"It is fun for my toy poodle, but the yellow ""caps"" are too large for him to get his mouth around to remove them. He does enjoy moving the ""cover"" around so he can retrieve the treats."
7711;Needs Modification;The reviewers who said the cake is flavorless or doesn't Taste good are right. Unfortunately I had already bought this sat the store and hadn't checked out the reviews and was loathed to return them.
7712;Misleading;Half alcohol - half extract.  It would have been nice if the seller had stated the ingredients in the web information.
7713;Highly Recco'd;All my pets get the best that I can give them. I researched long and hard to find the perfect food for my boxer (5mo), and this was highly recommended on the boxer forums I frequent (backed up by independent research).
7714;Product No Longer Available;This product, as originally produced, was an excellent addition to fried chicken. I was advised today by McCormick that this product is no longer available.
7715;my dog love this;my dogs love this dog food.  their fur is healthier looking nicer and softer.
7716;Gluten free;I have Celiac's Disease and so I eat a lot of Rice Chex for breakfast and snacks. This is the most cost-effective way to buy Rice Chex! Great deal.
7717;Two paws up;I have two small dogs who are very picky eaters and they like this dry dog food. They don't like many dry dog foods, but they will eat this one, especially when it's mixed with some canned dog food.
7718;Vanilla mint?;I understand that it says vanilla mint flavor, but I also expected it to smell something like that.  To be blunt, it is funky!  All three of my dogs (two cocker spaniels and a jack russell terrier)seemed to think that they smelled great, so who am I to judge.
7719;11 month old loves these;These mixed fruit and vegetable pouches are a must have when on the go and traveling.  My 11 month old son can suck the pouch, no need for spoons.
7720;Too sweet for my taste;The title is really it. These peppers are certainly crisp enough, and may very well be exactly what you are looking for.
7721;My Favorite Coffee - Strong, Bold, and Delicious!;I tried just about every kind of K-cup, looking for my perfect coffee. After trying, Tullys French Roast, I just started enjoying it and stopped looking.
7722;The very best Chai tea bags around;I never thought I would find a chai tea bag I liked better than Peet's, but this is it.  It is spicy and fresh and wonderful.
7723;Good Flavor with the Fragrance too;Rich and smoky. This is a good French Roast.
7724;Very tasty and refreshing.;It is nice to be able to determine myself how strong or weak I might want it. My daughter who is only 5 1/2 likes it as well.
7725;Won't do that again, Maxwell House.;Maxwell House International Coffee took over the General Foods International coffee line, and the chocolate coffee line shrank to almost nothing. Finally they come out with an attempt to give us back our Mocha, but what a price!!<br />I am being miserly with my order of Suisse Mocha Latte singles because it is the closest I can get to the old Viennese Chocolate mix, but I won't order it online.
7726;Poor packing;My daughter loves this Spring Vegi Pasta. So I ordered a dozen Earth's Best Junior Baby Food Organic Spring Vegetable and Pasta, 6-Ounce Jars (Pack of 12) - very disappointed to have a package arrived broken leaving me a huge mass and short food supply! I ordered previously the stage 1 and stage 2 with the same brand ( forgot the seller) which arrived in perfect condition with a tight box wrapped with plastic.
7727;Quick and easy;I used the lamb curry since I got some lamb in the fridge.  It came out good.
7728;The answer to global warming?;It is true, human ingenuity knows no bounds. How else can you account for the genius that decided to turn nasty fossil fuels into bubble-gum to feed to the young?<br /><br />I have no idea if there are any health implications for the youthful masticators of this product but, given my age, I don't much care anyway.
7729;Disappointed;Hello, I actually bought this at costco, but there was no option for rating, or to contact via email..
7730;Love'em;I originally bought these on a trip to Alaska..
7731;Decent, not great;This is a great price for individually wrapped peppermint tea, but the flavor is nowhere near as sharp and fresh as Celestial Seasonings or Yogi tea. We'll probably go with those brands in the future.
7732;Nice and Dark;Good bold flavor, should be a staple of any keurig drinker.  A little bit lighter than the Italian Roast, but not acidic.
7733;Worst Junk Food Ever;I have two cats and have always been feeding them this food,one is 5 and the other 9 years old and they are both 15 pounds.So they are fat and I could never figure out why,since they only got to share on cup between each other all day.
7734;Coo Coo for Coconuts;I love the smell of coconut! However, I must say, I assumed that coconuts were naturally sugary. Well.
7735;Husband loves this stuff;My husband loves this stuff, mixes it with Ginger Crystals tea.  And it is a really great price on Amazon.
7736;Excellent product;My dog is 15 years old and this product has greatly improved the condition of her teeth and her breath.  When I first gave her these she threw up and occasionally still does if she doesn't chew them well but the great majority of the time she's fine and she loves them.
7737;Great Popcorn!;Great popcorn - way better than the 'normal' stuff I've been buying from the supermarket for years. The popcorn comes out sweet - just add a little salt and you're good to go.
7738;Lovely smelling water...;I'd give it 4 stars if it was stronger. I typically use the largest setting on my Keurig.
7739;It's got electrolytes;Or so the bottle wrapping claims and there's more: Vitamins C, B3, B5, B6, B12 plus 'natural' caffeine and..
7740;Why Starbucks..Do you need to be seen there??;Never could understand the fuss over Starbucks. Overpriced by most opinions and now the money could be better used for gas.
7741;Not my favorite meatless meat...;Actually, I generally really like meat substitutes, but I found that this particular product fell flat with me. Although the texture was nice and chewy, there was a canned flavor that I just couldn't get past.
7742;Nice Flavor, Not Too Strong;Seeing a Jamaican coffee label, I assumed this would be a STRONG brew.  In actuality, it is a relatively weak brew.
7743;My dog adores these...;They are expensive and he's just as happy with the medium size, but there is no other treat in general that he likes as much. I can't really attest to their teeth cleaning ability as his teeth were just cleaned prior to our getting these.
7744;Great price;I was first introduced to these little gems at Sam's Club, but they no longer carry them, so I turned to Amazon and found a  great price on a product I hope to keep using for years.  It is the first (and only) individual serving drink mix diet tea I have found that is sweetened with Splenda - I don't do aspartame.
7745;Awesome!;This is great beef jerky. Low in salt and it has a great flavor.
7746;Never Used Them Before.;After reading about this spice in a book about healing spices I really felt the need to try it. Needless to say I have found this to be one of my favorites in an Indian drink for cooling down.
7747;Newman's Own;Received this very quickly.  It was securely packed.
7748;Deceptive packaging-it does have GMO ingredients;"Either these folks are completely ignorant or they think putting "" no genetically engineered ingredients"" on the front of the package will cause us to to ignore their list of ingredients on the back.  Canola oil is made from genetically modified rapeseed."
7749;Affordable bulk rooibos;If you drink a lot of rooibos, this is perfect for you. This is a very standard, run of the mill rooibos and hits the spot.
7750;UNCLE LEE'S WHITE TEA;GOOD TASTE AND THE TEA BAGS ARE TWO TO FOUR TIMES FULLER IN AMOUNT THAN OTHER TEAS I'VE USED.  I HAVEN'T TRIED REUSING THE BAGS.
7751;Kitten Heaven;This catnip is so potent my cat begs for it. We have to keep the container hidden away or she will try to pry off the lid with her teeth.
7752;Best Hot Chocolate Ever;I'm not a huge hot chocolate fan. They all seem to taste alike to me no matter the brand.
7753;Starbucks everyday =) Great Price;This was a great deal..
7754;The preferred salt for kitchen and table;Except for baking, Morton Coarse Kosher Salt is what I use in the kitchen and at the table. I prefer pure, plain salt to the somewhat muddled flavor of sea salt.
7755;Ener-G Foods Papa's Loaf;This is a wonderful product. My grandaughter is almost 9 years old and up until a couple of months ago had never eaten a piece of bread.
7756;Light and Tasty;Not a regular cereal eater but I found this to be a tasty treat.  Sweet, nutty, and a little bit salty which is a great combination.
7757;A little bit of Heaven;Many things are good, some great, some truly exceptional. Then there are things which one encounters in their lives that are unique
7758;Weak flavor, boasts a great impression though.;I was so excited to try this cocoa powder, being that it is dutch-processed (smooth, non-acidic), organic and fair trade. I figured it would have a deep dark rich chocolate flavor.
7759;Best Vanilla;This vanilla is the best there is for baking.  It is flavor and gives a true vanilla taste.
7760;Powerful punch;Wow, these chips bite back. I loves me some salt and pepper potato chips, but these have little bit too much spice for my liking.
7761;Full bodied and smooth tea;I've always been a Tetley tea drinker and didn't think that I would like loose tea but this tea has a wonderful flavor. I'm a convert now and haven't used a tea bag in quite a while.
7762;French Mayonnaise - Delouis Fils;"I was disappointed to find sunflower oil in this mayonnaise, as I had ordered it based on a recommendation in the book ""Eat Fat, Lose Fat,"" which advises to avoid sunflower oil. I e-mailed the author, who informed me that this mayonnaise had olive oil in it when the book was written."
7763;New and Improved Formula Much Better!!!!!!!!;I have been using this brand for about two months, but I was using the one with the new and improved formula. I decided to give this a try since it was cheap and I thought the Bavarian Chocolate would taste more chocolate-tier than the regular chocolate.
7764;Mr;I'm not happy with these reusuable cups ! They don't hold enough coffee so when using the Keuring system, I get a small cup of coffee intead of the middle button. I hope Keurig comes out with a better reusable k cup holder.
7765;Lovely Coffee, Shhh, Here's a Tip!;"I loved this coffee and it has an outstanding taste that I am sure will make it a big success! The coffee comes in  15 single serve ready-to-use-bags pr pouches that I found to make a ""strong"" cup of coffee.<br />I split open a bag and discovered that it hold three teaspoons full of coffee."
7766;not our favorite;We recently purchased seven unsweetened chocolate bars for comparison. The goal was to find an unsweetened chocolate that was so good (to snack on) that it didn't need sugar.
7767;No Issues;I don't know how everyone else got these broken, but when I received them they came wrapped in plastic and in bubble wrap, not a single jar was broken.  My son loves them and the price was great and I had no issues at all.
7768;Great Product, But Not In Stores Anymore.  Too Pricey Online.;I had been using this Pepper Season-All (under the McCormick label, UPC 052100071336, 5.75 oz.
7769;Hot Looking - Hot Tasting;I have loved this product for years (best jerk marinade you'll ever find, unless your mama makes a better one!). But, had trouble finding it consistently stocked in stores.
7770;Greenies;
7771;Good cup of coffee;These cups make a smooth medium strength coffee using the 10oz size on your Keuric.  Of course you can make it stronger or weaker depending on the amount of water used.
7772;Best buddy bones;My dog loves the treats!!! I have a yorkie and they are just the right size for him. I let a friend give her dog some and they loved them also.
7773;My Maltese loves it!;Sashie loves this dog food. For some reason, she tires of her other dog food I have tried.
7774;Convenient and simple!;I love these creamers! It is so convenient to keep these in the fridge (not necessary but I do) and just take out what you need. The price is the best here on Amazon, I first purchased these from another site and paid $2.
7775;wellness canned cat food;We bought a case of this cat food and our cats liked it and seemed to do well.  After it was gone, we bought a 2nd case and all 3 of our cats became violently ill and vomited after eating it.
7776;Excellent;This diet ginger ale syrup mix is great.  As good as any other ginger ale's out there and a much cheaper way to get it.
7777;Good Stuff!!!;If you like Margaritas, you'll like this easy to make mix.  It couldn't be easier.
7778;One of the Better K-cups;The best I've had is Tully's Kona blend but this isn't bad.  Strong and smooth.
7779;Vital Wheat Gluten;I received this item in a timely matter.  Got the Vital Wheat Gluten because breadmaker cookbook recommend this to make wheat bread raise more was disappointed.
7780;Delicious and soothing;I first tried this tea 4 years ago when a friend introduced it to me at work.  I was able to buy it at Trader Joes but they discontinued stocking it in my local store about a year ago.
7781;Great Value and Acceptable Taste;Best deal for the quantity of Oolong tea out there.  Maybe not as favorable as some other brands, but honestly, at the advertised price, you can use twice as much and still be better off than most of the competitors.
7782;Dogs Love These;Our dogs loved these, actually caused a first fight between two of them.  We won't buy again because of the cost,  they can go through these like a piece of bacon.
7783;Awesome price and quality...no dent cans;I wonder if someone started listening to the reviews on here of dented cans? Mine was shipped in a box with air-filled bags inside of another box with a ton more air-filled bags. No dents.
7784;Very poor quality;
7785;Gold Swirl Lollipops - Color all off!;I ordered both the aqua and gold lollipops and the aqua ones are true to color, however the gold ones are not even close.  It looks a muted pasty brown color vs the vibrant/true gold color pictured here.
7786;Excellent food for cats;I bought the large bag because my cats had been on it a few years ago, so I knew they would eat it and enjoy it. Their coats are better, I'm not finding kitty barf all over the house, and they have much more energy.
7787;Great healthy crunch.;If your looking for a great source of complex carbs without the fat and sodium, look no further.  These cakes taste really great and have a crunch you wont believe.
7788;sweet stuff;Kind has come up with some of the best combinations of nuts, berries, etc. this stuff is so very good, I could eat it all day long.
7789;My puppy loves these!;My pomeranian puppy is teething, and she loves these! They are the perfect size for her, literally slivers not full ears. This is fine for her because she can't choke on them.
7790;Good Salt!;I was at a health and wellness conference-- of all places-- when I was introduced to this salt by the manufacturer at the exhibitor's hall.  However, I had to agree with him that salt has taken a bit of a bad rap lately.
7791;Earl Grey bonus;An English nurse I worked with turned me on to this brand of tea. Other Earl Grey brands would get bitter if I spaced out and forgot it but while Twinings may get strong it doesn't get bitter.
7792;Quality K-Cups without emptying your wallet;Got these decaf K-Cups for my boss and he enjoys the coffee very much. My sole driving factor was price.
7793;Yummy;It's a nice product, great packaging, customizable taste. If they would throw some electrolytes in there it would be even better.
7794;Tastes homemade;I make mayonnaise once in a blue moon.  It's really not hard in a food processor, but it's so much easier to pull a jar out of the fridge.
7795;Highest Quality Dog Food at this price!!!!;I did a lot of research before settling on this product. The dogs love it and it is of the highest quality.
7796;Very great snack;This is one of my favorite snacks of all.  They are very delicious and have vitamins as with eating sweet potatoes other ways.
7797;Tough pill to swallow;I'm sure this is healthy..
7798;nutritious and delicious;These muffins are a great breakfast or snack. They are full of healthy stuff including flax seeds, are not too sweet, and are quite moist.
7799;I like Kind bars but not this flavor;This flavor has an overwhelming peanut, i.e.
7800;An Excellent Tea For When You Need to Relax;This tea tastes great and is perfect for studying late at night.  I had some doubts before I bought it, but it is absolutely delicious tea for a great price.
7801;Best cat food ever?;Wow if i knew how much cats would love this stuff i would have been feeding it to any and all of my cats long ago.  You would think it was wet food the way my kitty chows it down.
7802;Designed to Sweeten, not to affect flavor;I only see a single 3 star review for this product currently, and that simply doesn't do it justice. It exists as a way to sweeten Teas (and other beverages) without having a strong effect on the flavor itself.
7803;Pleasing pumpkin seeds;I am a regular purchaser of pumpkin seeds. They are my daily snack.
7804;So Good That You'll Wonder Where They Went;Tostitos with lime used to be my favorite tortilla chip. Corazonas now is.
7805;My kitty loves this product!;My kitty loves this!  I had trouble with a couple of the seeds sprouting and the dirt got some mold on it.  I put it outside and that helped a little but still no sprouting.
7806;Very Smooth Coffee;This coffee is great for espresso machines, but is a little weak in drip makers. Adding a little extra makes it great.
7807;Stays crunchy, a little too sweet;This isn't anything really exciting and it's a little sweet for me, but the kids like it.<br />It's relatively healthy and it stays crunchy.
7808;Love Triscuits, especially these ones!;I am addicted to Triscuits. I like both, regular and hint of salt, but I prefer these ones with less salt.
7809;From China, won't be buying again.;From China, won't be buying again.From China, won't be buying again.
7810;Boston Cookies Vegan Assorted Flavors 12/3.5 Oz (Multi-pack);I am vegan and ordered these cookies wanting only the choc chip
7811;extra virgin olive oil;this is a fantastic oil at a very budget minded light price, it is great for making dips, sauteing
7812;Would be good if they were really 'rainbow' ones;I used to get these in Ohio - and they were really rainbow colored.  Was disappointed to receive what seemed like leftover 'seasonal' sprinkles that were brown, yellow, and orange.
7813;Tasty for people (not just a cat treat)!!;This item arrived exactly as I expected it to be.  I have used it to make dashi (a Japanese stock using bonito flakes and kombu seaweed) and used the dashi to make miso soup (just add miso and vegetables).
7814;Great holistic food;My schnauzer loves this food, and I love that it doesn't contain corn or fillers she is allergic to. A great holistic food.
7815;Two Out of Three Agree!;I have three dogs. Two of them loved it, one so much that she tried to swallow the whole bottle, or run away with it and rip into it as she might a bone.
7816;Great rich taste;I bought this chocolate a couple of days ago and it just arrived. I like the way it was packaged in the box and when I open it and unpeeled the wrapper I was pleasantly surprised and the taste was great rich and full of flavor.
7817;FAST PRIME HEAT SINGLE SERVE BUT...;"<span class=""tiny""> Length:: 0:37 Mins<br /><br /></span>From a cold start, 90 sec to heat, 30 sec to brew. While already on, reheat and brew, 45 sec!!! But not compatable with reusable K-CUP??? Whats up with that??? I am considering returning this item."
7818;Cracked Pepper;Just finished my last 128 gm bag and ordered a dozen more.<br /><br />What can I say other than I'm addicted to these and I'm NOT a snack person.
7819;Wonderful Teas;I bought this tea wanting to try something new and was NOT dissapointed.<br />I drink it every morning.
7820;Not so tasty...;My baby didn't seem into these dinners, so I tried them. They're not terrible, but not good either.
7821;Great value;Received and the shipment only contained two duplicates. Very please with this purchase.
7822;"Great stuff. What a wonderful addition to the ""grain"" group of foods.";I strongly suggest that this become a part of your diet. Tasty stuff.
7823;Time Saver, Great Taste;Tastes great and very easy - place pouch in microwave for 1 minute and rice is ready. Fresh tasting and good chewiness, consistency to rice.
7824;Good!!!;Excellent flavor,very nice taste,love it,I really recommend this coffee.is not strong at all just fine,great whith cream or coffee mate.
7825;Delicious;My family loves this mix.  We normally use it for Belgian waffles, but occasionally also use it for pancakes.
7826;Yummy!;We love these. They are very yummy! I like that they are made with organic whole grain, and sweetened with fruit juice only, with peanut butter for protein.
7827;They are good, but overpriced.;These were a little out of my price range but I got them anyway.  I will not be buying them again until I am much more prosperous!  They taste like pears, they're organic, and they will last a long time in storage.
7828;It really does taste just like peanut butter!;"<a href=""http://www.amazon."
7829;Love it! - helps my stress and anxiety, sleep, and blood pressure;I'm so glad my doctor told me about this stuff.  I was having high blood pressure, anxiety attacks, just stressed out.
7830;just okay;I drink a lot of water! This water didn't do anything amazing (big surprise..
7831;Beef Stick;These are the best smoked beef sticks I've ever had. This is my third time buying them and this bag is a good as the first.
7832;Great!;This coffee is very good. I read the reviews on how the acidity is low and won't bother the stomach and it is true.
7833;Great product!;Perfect product. This is exactly what I purchased.
7834;great olives;these olives are great. They are firm and tasty.
7835;For more than just baking;As winter approaches, I feel moved to share one of my secrets<br />for satisfying winter stews that are not excessively fatty.<br />You can use the bitter tang and the concentrated flavor and<br />fattiness of unsweetened chocolate to add a dimension to almost<br />any stew that will delight ( and mystify ) your guests.
7836;OMG I'm addicted!!!;Better than peanut butter!!!  'nuff said!  and i loooooooove peanut butter!!!  This almond butter is smooth, flavorful and just overall outstanding.  I can literally eat it by the spoonful.
7837;Love these chips--Happy to see them on Amzaon.;These BBQ chips are crisp, well-spiced, & satisfying.  I don't eat as many of these at 1 sitting as I do with regular (Lay's) BBQ chips.
7838;Spicey, tasty goodness;These are not like the original Jacks Links beef sticks, this are tangy, spicy and long  :-).  At first I was upset like the other customer thinking they were going to be like the original ones but after eating more than 5 I started getting used to them with their spicyness.
7839;Quality not what you find at local retailers;I purchased two types, the original and the salt and vinegar. The original tasted burned, they were very tan/brown in color.
7840;I wouldn't call it bold;"I got this coffee as part of a ""bold"" sampler pack.  While I found it flavorful I wouldn't call it bold."
7841;REVISED REVIEW - Please Read;Being born and bred in Brooklyn but now living upstate NY, of course we had to try this product.  Short and sweet, the coffee is good but the packaging is horrible, every two to three cups comes loaded with grinds.
7842;Excellent value for the price!;These are the exact filets that can be purchased in any grocery store, but at a much better price.  I am extremely satisfied with the product.
7843;NO waste at all--- all dogs love liver treats--- great for training!;Freeze dried liver has a hypnotic effect on dogs.  They LOVE it and will do just about anything for it, so it is a great treat to use for training.
7844;won't buy again;I live in Wisconsin and love cheese of all kinds. This was nasty.
7845;IS NOT ORGANIC AND CONTAINS GMOS;I loved this granola until I realized it is falsely described here as organic.  It is not organic, contains no organic ingredients and further contains genetically modified ingredients (GMOS).
7846;Great maple syrup !;Due to it's economy price, I was concerned about the quality before the order arrived. But when I received the order, I found the maple syrup has great taste with excellent flavor.
7847;Fantastic!;I was sceptical of this product when I received it but was sold once I gave it a try.  A little bit of water and you have peanut butter that your diet will like!  It is great in protein shakes, baked items, or just to eat by the spoonful (reconstituted of course).
7848;BEST TEA I EVER TRIED !!!;Amazing tea, difficult to find. I'm glad that Amazon.
7849;Vinegar... Not my taste!;This is the first time I tried Sea Salt & Vinegar chips. Not my taste.
7850;The truth, and nothing but the truth....;Ok, these are not the best noodles you will ever have,<br />However, if you are looking for variety and on a diet then they serve their purpose.<br /><br />I recently had a personal breakthrough while dieting:<br />1.
7851;YESSSSS!!!!;Exactly what I said when these actually worked when giving my multipoo his pills using pill pockets! He recently broke his leg and has been given many pills including pain pills, sedatives, and antibiotics. He wouldn't take them with hotdogs, cheese, or in his food.
7852;Great purchase!;All 3 flavor packs are very tasty and low calories.  They travel well & are not crumbly like some of their competitors.
7853;Country of Origin Changes Depending On Supplier;I am a long time Haribo fan. I was first introduced to Haribo gummies when I moved to Germany in 1979.
7854;Green Mountain k-cup Breakfast blend;I searched Google and found these k-cups. The price is reasonable.
7855;not too sweet, low cal, and great taste;I love the taste of this tea. It's naturally sweet without being overwhelming and has just the right balance of tea/peach flavor.
7856;Regular tortilla chips.  Not flavorful.;"I have noooo idea what the ""blech"" titled review is about.  My bag is not spicy at all, and the chips definitely don't taste bad."
7857;Van Houtee Creme Brulee coffee is a winner for a cold pick-me-up;I've been trying to duplicate Baskin Robbins Capuccino Blasts for years. So I have come close using this Keurig coffee cup, then add a little artificial sweetener, a tablespoon of Hillsbrothers English toffee mix and a little heavy whipping cream.
7858;My Favorite Treat;"This is a great tasting low calorie, low sugar and low cost treat.  A ""serving"" is 35 calories--I double that--still only 70 calories."
7859;LOVE THE PRODUCT;I would purchase this product again.  Love it.
7860;LOVE the Flavor;I received a bar to sample through Influenster. I was a bit skeptical about eating it, since I do not like banana bread because of the nuts.
7861;Could not finish this flavor;I am not a huge fan of lentils but I thought with the couscous I might could eat it.Took 2-3 bites and could not finish it.
7862;Yummy Gummy!!;The Cons:  I received three bags of wine gums in a plain brown cardboard box. None of the packaging had any identifying labels--not the manufacturer, not the ingredients, nothing.
7863;Net weight was shy by 15ozs.;No problem with the Tuna. It's very decent.
7864;Not quite all that.;"I'm a big fan of the Idahoan instant mashed potatoes in all the various flavors and have rated them highly here on Amazon.  However, the ""Loaded Baked"" flavor was my least favorite of the bunch."
7865;A little on the sweet side.;Got this box at an axcellent price off Amazon.<br />The Strwberry and Mixed Berry flavors tend to be a little on the sweet side (too sweet).
7866;Disgusting :(( and not as natural as pretend to be;"The ""natural flavor"" that listed in the ingredients happens to be an extract from apricot seeds (or Hydrogen cyanide)  .."
7867;Kids like them and Mommy does too!;I bought these to tuck into my 5 year old's lunch box for camp this summer. Its hard to find a treat for kids lunches that does not contain dairy, nuts or wheat and that is an appropriate portion size for what is essentially a sweet treat.
7868;Not a substitute for argan oil;I have fine, slightly wavy hair that is prone to frizziness, especially in the very humid conditions that are prevalent in my city.  In the past, I have used argan oil after showering and before blow-drying to take away the frizz without weighing down my hair or making it look greasy.
7869;A must have if you have painful heavy periods;I had very painful cramps with Very Heavy bleeding that lasted for 5 days! and this cycle repeated every 21 days! So I would have a full period twice a month!! I was miserable and had to schedule my life around my cycle, because I was doubled over in pain or afraid of the embarrasment of bleeding onto my clothes! A friend recomended drinking this tea and my life changed!! I no longer have ANY Cramps!! the bleeding has subsided to 3 days with a normal flow and now my cycle is regulated to every 26 days or once a month. I have more energy and vitality and dont have to call in sick anymore!! This tea is blessing not only for pregnancy but for your menstrual cycle as well!! I tell every woman I know about this tea!! No need for birth control pills or other hormonal intervention.
7870;good for a fresh tasting occasional cup;I don't drink coffee as I get a stomach ache from caffeine but when someone who visits wants a cup this is great to have on hand.  Everyone whose had one of these  preferred it to my regular instant.
7871;You have got to be kidding me!;I tried this yesterday..
7872;Great party favors;Loved the product.  They made great party favors for my son's birthday with the video game truck.
7873;WONDERFUL TEA;The tea is absolutely wonderful!!!  I love it any time of the day.  The flavor is perfect for plain black tea.
7874;Change is not always Good;I have been ordering this brand and flavor of tea for months.Just recently my last delivery came the can was half full and the tea was very weak and the price is still the same.
7875;AMAZING!;This stuff is transcendence in a can!  I swear its that good.  The vanilla flavor is perfect, not too sweet to be artifical, and not too malted to taste funky.
7876;Very Good Coffee But Somewhat Expensive - Recommended;"This Starbucks ""Veranda Blend Blonde"" K-Cup makes a nicely smooth cup of coffee that tastes every bit as good as the in-store brew. I personally go for stronger and ""bolder"" coffee but most of the other coffee drinkers in my family prefer this over the much more affordable <a href=""http://www."
7877;These chips are awesome!;My husband and I stumbled across these chips at our favorite health food store.  WOW!  They are packed with flavor.
7878;"""Daddy the fruit rope makes my tummy hurt.""";What can I say, I got caught up when this was a gold box item and I didn't take the time to research the product.  Essentially these 0.
7879;Cat owner;I bought this product because of the ingredients . No grain , thinking this would be healthier for my multiple cats .
7880;Hot stuff !;This is the exact same restaurant quality Chinese Hot Mustard.  I searched everywhere for it.
7881;Orgain Sweet Vanilla Meal Replacement;"<a href=""http://www.amazon."
7882;Tasty, moist, works great;"I found these at the grocery store, and used one box to make ""shortcakes"" in a <a href=""http://www.amazon."
7883;Best Brand of Steel Cut Oats;I have tried several brands of steel cut oats, and Quaker is definitely the best.  We recently moved to a new city, and I have been unable to find this product at any store here.
7884;they are ok!;i usually love spicy chips..
7885;low quality ingredients;The Quaker granola bars are jam packed with low quality ingredients.  Too much sugar and offer very little hunger satisfaction when compared with the competition.
7886;So awful - the artificial sweetener is over-powering - I can't even drink it;I was so disappointed in these - they taste nothing like a chai tea latte one would get at a coffee shop or a mix from the grocery store.  It has a bitter chemical taste from the sucralose and is incredibly sweet besides.
7887;YUM, YUM, YUM TERRIFIC;Great flavor and plenty of it! It's like eating chocolates: They are so rich in lime flavor you can only eat 2 or 3 at a time. The bite size morsels are perfect, lots of flavor and great cookie tastes blended together well.
7888;Kick yo butt good.;We've been using this product for years.  The flavor is rich and delicious.
7889;Not what I expected.;"With this actually being marketed as ""diet food"" (admittedly with a fairly funny view once I read the package) I really wanted to not like these. I ordered them as an ""add on"" item to a recent order, to make up the last of the 25$."
7890;Vanilla Coke;If you're a fan of Sonic Drive-In and their vanilla Coke, Torani's sugar-free syrup will replicate that flavor exactly - delicious and you can adjust the flavor to your taste.  It really does make a tasty beverage and no calories.
7891;Good taste, good value;These were good but I like Klein's a little better as Klein's is less greasy and salty but these are good too and better than chips. Even my young kids eat them.
7892;Excellent!;These are fantastic tomatoes - nice and juicy with a perfect balance of sweet and tangy. There's very little salt added, which is another benefit, since you can control the amount of salt you want to use for each dish.
7893;Awful;I guess I should have driven to Trader Joe's and purchased one bag only, as this item taste terrible.  This item on Amazon came in 6 pack only.
7894;White cheddar cheese powder;No more cheese loafs to melt, this is a great product, from mac and cheese to broccoli and rice casserole, this saves time and tastes great. highly recommended.
7895;medocre tea;I love blooming teas & lavender. I can accept a poor tea with a beautiful blossom or vice versa, but this had neither.
7896;absolutely amazing;This is a definite buy. This is the first store bought cookie that Ive ever had that taste like homemade.
7897;Great for tamarind cashew dip;I needed tamarind to make a copycat version of the Cheesecake Factory avacado dipping sauce.  This wasn't the exact product called for, however it was great.
7898;Mega-gingery;Ginger is one of my favorite flavors, and Ginger Altoids sure don't disappoint. Hot and sweet at the same time, with a perfect gingery burn.
7899;Excellent;The machine was delivered promptly.  We opened it at Christmas and my husband is having a good time making soda for both of us.
7900;Good Cat Food;This Cat food is very delicious that my cat loves the product. Every time I open the pouch, my cat will come wanting to eat it.
7901;Love this product;I've been using this product for quite a while for my 2-year old dog.  My dog was diagnosed of luxating patella on his left rear knee when he was a puppy, I started giving this product since then, it got much better and now he barely limps on his affected knee, this product is helping somehow for sure.
7902;Holy Sugar!;Does it taste good?  Yes and it better had to be as it packs about 66 grams of sugar per can!  You get your energy blend, vitamins, minerals and other good stuff, but I wish they would consider cutting down on sugar.  While I realize that each can gives you TWO servings (33g per serving,) it is a can, so it would be inconvenient to keep it open while it gets stale and loses the fizz.
7903;Yummy Indulgence;My daughter and I both enjoy these cookies very much.  Enough to warrant a subscription that will deliver them to our doorstep once every 2 months.
7904;DELICIOUS;These have a slight nutty flavor.  If you do not like peanuts then you might not like these.
7905;A fan;Ok, this stuff is the cure for family visits lol. I only had this stuff a week or so before going home to visit my very large and loud family that although I love dearly, can drive me crazy when it's unheard of to stay in a hotel.
7906;Best herb tea on the planet!;I really hope Amazon dosn't discontinue this tea because it is so hard to find.  It has a lovely naturally sweet, cinnamon flavor.
7907;Did not work well - clogged my machine;I was anxious to try these cups since they seemed to be sealed like the original K-Cups, but was very disappointed in the product.  Though the cups came with no instructions, it was apparent that you just put the filter in, add coffee, then pop the lid on.
7908;Rather Bland;I am an adventurous person who likes new things and when Amazon began selling the Bahlsen line I tried a number of their products and found them to be enjoyable and tasty, but the Hannover Wafer Cookies are, to my palate, rather bland and tasteless. The texture is pleasing, though a little grainy tasting and the creme filling has little flavor.
7909;not a fan;I did not care for this coffee. The first thing I noticed when I opened it is that it smells bad and I'm the kind of person that likes the smell of coffee.
7910;best of the brand;this is my fav of their blends..
7911;Green Mountain Coffee, Dark Magic k-cup;I've been drinking this for quite awhile now and have not been disappointed.  If you like a strong cup of coffee, I think you will like this.
7912;32 Large Treats;My dog loves these treats! However the # of treats in the box would have been helpful in choosing which item to select for the best value. 32 Large treats in a 5 lb.
7913;Excellent!;Despite having just as much sugar as the troika of Kellogg's cereal that Moms hate but kids love (Corn Pops, Apple Jacks and Froot Loops), this escapes the bad press, probably because it doesn't contain the words Loops, Pops or Jacks which Moms seem to identify with artificial flavors (another Mom banned substance).<br /><br />So this is one of my favorite cereals that my Mom did not ban.
7914;Walkers smkey bacon crisps;These are amazing chips but they just cost too much for the little amount that you get. They come from England so I suppose they have a way to travel.
7915;OMH dog biscuits;I agree with another review in that too many biscuits are broken when they arrive at my house. BTW I had the same problem buying them directly at the store.
7916;great white kidney beans;I've been using these beans for years and they are excellent. Contrary to what another viewer wrote I have never gotten a can where the beans were crushed.
7917;Good flavors and WAY better than baked chips.;The flavors are great - especially Jalapeno and Honey Mustard.  They're not as good as real chips, but you can save a few calories and fat grams and they are WAY better than baked chips.
7918;My favorite;I have tried several of the Stash herbal teas (and other brands), and this is my favorite.  As mentioned by some of the other reviewers, it is a little weak when compared to other brands, but the flavor makes up for that, in my opinion, and I do not always want a strong tea.
7919;The best I have found but expensive;This is the best I have found so far, strong and ok tasting. I like the Keurig for its convenience but have not found the perfect coffee yet.
7920;With Coconut Oil, Skin Care is no Toil;I purchased Vitacost extra virgin coconut oil after learning of the health benefits of louric acid, abundantly present in the oil. Being from the Commonwealth Caribbean, I am used to cooking with coconut oil and other uses of the product.
7921;Spice;It was good but we have to be careful with the shells while cooking with rices or others. Do not eat the shells.
7922;My cat stopped barfing!;Wow my cat just loves this food.  I love that it doesn't have grains.
7923;Excellant BBQ brush;This is the Cadillac of BBQ brushes. Long handle is great for the grill - no more barbequed fingers! Angled brush head is perfect.
7924;Pistachio addict...;Hello, my name is Tom, and I'm a pistachio addict.  I can't help myself and these are excellent pistachios.
7925;Carnation Malted Milk Powder  13-oz. jar. - Chocolant AND Original;October 11, 2011:  I just got off the phone after calling a few markets trying to find BOTH Chocolate AND the Original Carnation Malted Milk Powder and this is what I found in Bend, Oregon so you might want to try some of your markets in your area. Both of these flavors come in the 13-ounce jars.
7926;great jerkey;They taste great, its the only way my and my shop can get fresh jerky out here in Afghanistan. Recieved the package promptly for my area and everything was fresh and un-damaged.
7927;Damaged Before Shipping;The package arrived with 2 other items I had ordered.  They were okay, but I noticed something stick on the box with the agave in it.
7928;Yes, great ingredients. But Diamond Pet Foods are RECALLED;This is not a true review about this products features per say..
7929;Good to the last chip!;The Boulder malt vinegar & sea salt potato chips are very good, the flavor is different and very tasty. It is a good snack, maybe a bit too much salt, but great for something to eat between meals, to satisfy a craving.
7930;Like it a lot;It was shipped in a very nice package and I have no complain with the seller. My plant growing bigger and now I am looking for a bigger pot to transplant.
7931;Love &lt;
7932;Tastes fantastic, great for little treats or gifts, and packaged well.;These are packaged to sell by the 'sleeve' of six packs but I like to give them out at meetings.  People love PEZ.
7933;Not the most versatile spaghetti;This spaghetti makes for some good food, but it certainly doesn't make the best shoes. I was advised to buy this specific spaghetti (De Cecco) along with a chocolate shoe mold (which doubles as a real shoe mold) in order to make my own shoes.
7934;treat not a chew bone;These are great as a treat, but not as a chew. They are so well liked they don't last.
7935;popchips prices;I loved buying a case of popchips for $13.42.
7936;I love this poo;Growing up, I never ate mac n cheese. Something about that orange colored stuff just turned me off.
7937;Leaking, spurting K-cups;Our negative rating is not about the coffee, but rather the k-cups construction.  The top was  not securely attached to the plastic cup and every cup had hot coffee spurting all over that section of our kitchen.
7938;Good stuff!;This hot cocoa is delicious, low in calories, and reasonably priced. Although the label only states that it is fat-free, it is also sugar-free.
7939;Nothing Tastes Like HOME;One of the few domestic Dutch-processed baking cocoas, Hershey's European-style is excellent for the price.  It is a dark roast similar to most Italian cocoas.
7940;Taste like the stuff I get in restaurants;This stuff tastes really good, similar to the white miso soups you get at fancy asian restaurants. Simple and great to have as a snack.
7941;trailblazers;This is my favorite trail mix.The fruit,nut ratio is perfectly balanced.
7942;Elegant and unique food item;I truly love the Stem Ginger in Syrup most particularly, during the Thanksgiving and Christmas Holidays.  For those of you that like to provide a dish that is different from standard fare this is the foodstuff to use.
7943;Dogs like it more than I like giving it to them.;My dogs love this.  But it's undeniably odd.
7944;ice tea;THis ice tea, is like heaven on ice.  must try if you love lemon and giger.
7945;worst taste ever;I had so much hope for this product. I had the hardest time getting the horrible bean taste out of my mouth.
7946;What about Golden Maple;How come Golden Maple gets no love from anyone? Most grocery stores only carry brown sugar and cinnamon, with very few carrying limited number of Golden Maple flavor. In my opinion, Golden Maple is the best
7947;Tasty, but;While I found these very very tasty and yes they could be addictive, once again, they were stale and dry.  Poor quality.
7948;bleh...;I was not as impressed as the other reviewers.  If you are reading this and are used to freshly ground coffee every morning, please don't buy this.
7949;Wow!;Bought this product on a whim.  My wife buys Kashi products and the combination of ingredients sounded tasty, so.
7950;Kraft Catalina What Happened?;The new formulation of a this standby product is terrible. The taste  and smell have lost their zing and freshness.
7951;Good taste requires some effort to prepare;Followed the instructions on the package, and it turned out pretty good. was a hit with invited friends.
7952;good product...customer service is poor;the coffee is good. but I've been trying to cancel the auto shipments but its impossible to find any way for customer service to help.
7953;Ka-YUM-Me;I'm so addicted to these little cheesy rice-crackers.  They are absurdly expensive at the local market, so I am glad I can get them through amazon.
7954;The Best;I love Olive Oil with Lemon. It adds such a great dimension to everything from salads, to pasta, to meat.
7955;I used to get these on AA flights with my snack back in the day!;These beverages are good with or without Alcohol. They used to hand them out like candy on American Airlines.
7956;cryskittys;Tastes great! This is my kind of product..
7957;Hard to believe it's sugar free;I bought this candy after a long search for sugar free lemon flavored candy. My doctor recommended I use it to help with a dry mouth in preference to other flavors.
7958;best dog treat-- great for training---  all dogs love them;Freeze dried liver has a hypnotic effect on dogs.  They LOVE it and will do just about anything for it, so it is a great treat to use for training.
7959;Could Easily break a tooth;So disappointed with this product. Bought it online because I thought it would taste high end homemade.
7960;Provides Hours of Durable Fun for our Puppies!;I purchased our first Busy Buddy Tug for Hudson's 1st Birthday! He is a constant busy-body and this toy provides hours of entertianment for him. My concern was the durability becasue he can chew through most everything immediately.
7961;So delicious.;This tea is awesome, and also way cheaper from amazon than from the official website. All my friends that try it are hooked.
7962;Great product, great price;I have a very hyper but adorable chihuahua papillon mix. He is my favorite little thing in the world but every now and then I need him to settle down and let me do other things then pay attention to him.
7963;Simply Amazing, Tastes Delicious!;This simply is delicious. If you've ever enjoyed a Reese's Peanut Butter Cup you'll love this, it tastes the same.
7964;Great product!;I would highly recommend this product. For those of you who are gluten intolerant, it is a delicious cereal.
7965;Find another treat;I have an almost two year old lab mix named Ares. I willingly admit to spoiling him and didnt mind getting him these over priced treats.
7966;OK;I thought the coffee tasted fine.  It was not strong enough for my husband.
7967;$$$$$$$$;At $15 for 5 pounds these lentils cost $3 a pound.  My wife was very unhappy with me as she can get them for a dollar a pound at the store.
7968;delicious and nutritious;I have enjoyed the intense flavor, versatility, and healthful benefits of cocoa nibs for many years.  These nibs from Navitas are of consistently high quality and I recommend them to anyone who is looking for nibs.
7969;Rum Cakes;Tortuga Rum Cakes are always a good choice.  If you haven't tried them before, you need to.
7970;Not exactly banana bread, but close;This little snack bar seems designed to be banana bread in a wrapper, and it's not perfect, but it's definitely very good.  The most important aspect of a snack bar, for me, is taste, and this is a tasty snack.
7971;Best I've Had Yet!!;They are not saltines, though I've heard Glutino makes those too, and they aren't Ritz crackers (a butter flavor GF cracker would be awesome, do they make those?), they are the best I've had. The texture is not your typical GF grainy, gritty texture, and they are far tastier than the rice crackers.
7972;Delicious;Ordered these specifically to use with our soymilk maker.<br />Soybean quality is high, no pebbles or dirt.
7973;My kids love these;My kids love these banana chips, and I love the fact that they are easy to pack and take along in the car. I keep some in my car and in my diaper bag in case we need emergency snacks.
7974;ez sweetz;I read the reviews before purchasing this item and its true its not as sweet as the company claims. One drop doesn't equal one packet of splendia regardless of which size you buy.
7975;Exceptionally mild flavor;Which could be grand for some yet I had hoped for more.  I will keep searching for the coffee and tea enhancer of my dreams.
7976;Great Coffee;Very Good coffee ..
7977;awesome tea. really helps you breathe;I love this tea. I've been drinking it for a couple of years and it's my favorite.
7978;Nice product;I order these for my mom. She loves peach flavored drinks (juices) but was diagnosed for diabetes this year.
7979;Love the tea...not the price.;I absolutely love this tea..
7980;Tastes like...Vanilla;This is the only vanilla we buy
7981;Most AWESOME seasoning ever!;This seasoning is without a doubt the best I've ever come across - and the most versatile.  It can be used on veges, potatoes, salads, beef, pork, chicken, fish and probably lots of things I've forgotten to mention.
7982;SOY??? WHY?;Maybe I didn't read the ingredient list thoroughly, because I was not expecting to find SOY in my tea!! What a disappointment! I called Stash to find out if the soy was GMO, and..
7983;wow;LOVE it, great deal. fast shipping.
7984;Tastes Great;I used one package for a few ppl for gifts.  One package went a LONG way.
7985;My Chihuahua loves these!;I haven't been using them long enough to see if they are keeping his teeth clean. I am optimistic though.
7986;My Cat loves this stuff...;My 13-year old male cat has been a non-fish eater his whole life. I decided to upgrade the quality of his food and bought a sample pack of Tiki Cat.
7987;Lots of ENERGY;I Work 12 hour shifts that usually turn into 13-14 hours of work and then only get about 5-6 hours of sleep in between. So naturally, I have tried just about every energy drink and shot out there.
7988;Coffee supreme;Received quickly and was as advertised. Recommend this product to everyone that enjoys different coffee blend and use Keurig K-cups.
7989;Good food;My 7 month old son likes this. We tried this after first doing peaches and bananas separately, and he likes them together too.
7990;Makes my cat sick;This won't happen to all cats, but they made mine throw up.  Wish I would have tried a sample out first before buying.
7991;This was everything I was hoping for;I didn't want a run-of-the mill popcorn cake, and this isn't one of those. It's more corn tortilla-like, perfect for topping with taco salad or salsa.
7992;Yummmmm!;I am neither vegan nor health obsessed, but I keep a stock pile of Dr. McDougall's hot cereal and soup cups in my desk at work.
7993;Great taste!;Someone recommended this iced green tea to me, and I'm happy that I could find it on Amazon.<br /><br />Though the Amazon is a little bit expensive than the website, but consider I don't need to fill out the order form, and pay the tax and shipping fees, Amazon is a better choice.
7994;Great Value;Found Mrs. May's candy bars at a pharmacy and had to return the next day to buy more.
7995;I did not receive my order;I placed my order through Amazon and after about 10 days inquired about my order because it had not shipped.  I received an email back from Starbucks that my order had been canceled.
7996;Khazana Brown Basmati Rice;Excellent brown basmati rice for the price.  If you prepare it properly, each cooked grain comes out separate and individual.
7997;Great;Bought this for my sister who loves water. She was happy with it and will be a regular customer.
7998;olive perfume;lovely aroma and fruity flavor with the tiniest hint of a peppery finish is making me think that the best olives are grown in spain rather than italy.<br /><br />ever since the scandal broke in the New Yorker magazine (august 13, 2007 - Slippery Business by Tom Mueller.
7999;My cat almost died;Be warned. The third ingredient is potato, which is very starchy and nearly as bad as wheat or corn for some cats.
8000;Excellent!;This is an excellent product.  I tried a handful that a friend had and I was hooked!  It has good flavor without being too salty.
8001;not so good;Fruit is NOT sweet, juicy, delicious and bursting with flavor as stated on the package.  Yuk.
8002;blueberry candy;The best thing about Melissa's dried blueberries is the plastic bag it comes in which you can reseal.  The ingredients are whole blueberries and high fructose corn syrup.
8003;"""Must Have""";Delicious flavor enhancer. I will never go back to kosher salt again.
8004;My pups gobble them down!;Old Mother Hubbard biscuits (we've tried these as well as the puppy variety) are the only true biscuits my dogs like! They would eat the whole bag if I let them. The only thing I don't like is they contain wheat, but as long as your dog doesn't have a wheat allergy, it's no big deal.
8005;Our cat LOVES these treats!;"Our cat goes bananas over these treats!  He will do anything to get them.  He begs, he turns ""the cute"" on to overload, and then he purrs as soon the bag opens."
8006;Shipping out of sight;I learned after the fact that the same product was 2.98 cheaper at a wholesale club and the $9.
8007;Not Bad. Not Outstanding. HIghly Drinkable Medium Blend. Produces a Decent Cup of Coffee.;All in all, this Folgers Lively Colombian coffee is a decent medium blend coffee.  It has a slight bite, but is highly drinkable and has no discernible aftertaste.
8008;dog treats;Exxcellent quality. Best treats on the market.
8009;A healthy meal-to-go option that is not too bad tasting;"Specifically marketed towards the health conscious, the all-organic ""GoPicnic Ready-to-Eat Meals, Salmon + Crackers"" is a pretty good meal-to-go alternative. The cracker and salmon combo is quite tasty, fairly rich tasting, while not being too salty, while the fruit and nut mix and the organic chocolate bar both provide a nice sweet treat."
8010;habanero hot sauce;This is one of the best habanero hot sauces out. It has a slight vinegar taste to it, but not overpowering.
8011;tasty,;Cracker is good, flavorful and sturdy. Tastes good with most any topping or plain.
8012;Great Magnesium suppliment, sweet dream lie ahead!;Was turned on to this product at a local store. This company makes excellent products, and this keeps the quality going.
8013;happy;I love these packs. They are delicious and easy to throw in a diaper bag or my kids lunch in the morning.
8014;Cooked Well;I am no expert at making rice, thus I was pleased at how the rice cooked up in my rice cooker.  I figured, I buy a rice cooker to see if that improved my rice cooking.
8015;Delicious!;I ordered these cookies for my husband as he's diabetic and loves peanut butter treats, so it was no surprise that he really liked them.  What was surprising, however, was that I liked them, too!  As a rule, I do not like peanut butter anything, and can barely stand the smell of it.
8016;I love it;I am a veterinarian with 7 years experience, and I have 3 Great Danes.  I am always looking for safe, effective, fun, and innovative new pet products.
8017;Taste so good;When I first noticed this product at Panda Express, I didn't know what to expect but when I tried Izze, it was something I haven't had before.  It was so refreshing to have a drink to have real sugar in it and not artificially sweetener.
8018;Nummy, nummy, nummy!;I ***LOVE*** this cereal!..
8019;Nice gentle smoke flavor;I enjoy this salt on popcorn, roasted peppers, and many other foods. It has a gentle smoke that adds a nice little special touch to finishing a preparation.
8020;My Cat Loved This!;My cat gobbled this food right up!  Each small serving can is perfect to feed one cat without the worry of overfeeding.  My cat is elderly and very picky about her food.
8021;Awesome, slightly acquired taste!;Yes these do taste VERY slightly different from the vending machine ones but I have acquired a tasted for these over those as of late. They are nice and salty (but not overwhelmingly so), and I love the crunch and veggie combo taste that I get.
8022;Sage tea definitely promotes a good night's sleep.;It was touted by a friend as a sleep inducer, so I tried it and it works.  It tastes kinda mediciney, but it definitely does the job.
8023;Yummy Gummy for the t.....ok ,I won't say it;I have tried many brands. I like Black Forest the best.
8024;Great and here is an easy way to cook it;I love this oatmeal.  My complaint over the years was the time it took to cook.
8025;Would do business again;Items arrived in a timely manner and in excellent condition.  Will do business again with this vendor.
8026;Excellent tasting however quite pricey;"What more can I say that I already didn't say in the review title? :-)<br /><br />Excellent taste like quality leaded (""regular"") espresso coffee. The can also is great as I now use it for storing other brands of coffee that I buy in larger quantities or in bulk and storing in these Illy containers."
8027;beyond addictive;It's a surprise the first time, but everything the name promises.  Plus delicious and though you might suspect you couldn't live without eating an entire box for dinner, actually one is usually plenty to satisfy for at least a half a day.
8028;The best!!! Allows you to make tea just as good as Starbucks!;I have been a huge iced tea fan my whole life and a Venti Passion Iced Tea sweetened is my absolute favorite drink at Starbucks. While the iced tea is pretty cheap option at Starbucks, by buying this, I am able to recreate my favorite drink at home.
8029;Love it for most dogs;I've used this product, and others from Premier, for years.  For most dogs it's GREAT (I've fostered dogs and have my own).
8030;Wonderful Whole Grain Brown Rice;Purchasing Lundberg Jubilee, Gourmet Blend of Whole Grain Brown Rice, 16-Ounce Units (Pack of 6) was a great decision. This rice has a great nutty taste.
8031;Great dog treats;My 3 maltese love these.  The product is great.
8032;full of little bugs;Don't buy this soil
8033;Our dogs love it!;Our dogs love Beneful -- we get it for them regularly. we like to mix in a little fresh meat or leftovers, but that's not really necessary.
8034;The best fruitcake money can buy IMO;I have tasted fruitcakes from several manufacturers in the United States. The Trappist Abbey Monastery Fruitcake is the best.
8035;INCREDIBLE!!!;This spice is out of this world.  We are blown away.
8036;Quality English Breakfast, the way it is meant to be enjoyed;Loose leaf tea is nearly always better than the smaller grained tea bag sort, and Twinings English Breakfast loose tea is no exception. If you are looking for a delicious and aromatic English Breakfast tea, this is a quality choice.
8037;It's Just So Gross!;I grew up with this movie.  At first I thought it had no plot, and was just a series of gross random events where Beetlejuice does bad stuff.
8038;Takes a few batches, but keep at it...;The first batch was a little disappointing, but as the batches progress, they keep getting better.  The grains are now large and healthy (4 batches) and the kefir water is greatly improved.
8039;the nacho flavor is vague but delicious;if you like slim jims, these have just a hint of nacho cheese flavor. personally, i find them quite delicious.
8040;Great Idea for Solid Chewer;We bought this item for our dog (a pit/lab mix) as a christmas gift. Straight out of the box, he loved it.
8041;I *love* Apple Jacks, but petroleum derived Blue 1 doesn't love me...;I absolutely love the Apple Jacks flavor, I could eat them everyday (IF I pick out all the green Os..
8042;Harvey gives 4 Paws Up!;Harvey's the World's most picky eater, and turns his nose to foods most other dogs would woof down (pun intended).  He loves Newman's Own Organics Dog Treats, which is great.
8043;jumbo candy bar;product as advertised, quick delivery. Was a little worried about shipping, but candy arrived in one piece with no problems.
8044;Not worth it!;"If you plan on making a pitcher of tea, forget it, it takes 4 packs for 64 oz and is still very, very weak in flavor, and it must be consumed in 12 hours (so they say) so you're much better off brewing your own.<br /><br />However, if you're idea is to ""stash"" this in your purse (for the ladies) or pocket (for men, which would be weird) it's still misses the mark."
8045;Chicken Drumsticks;These treats are my doggies favorites.  I use to be able to buy them at the grocery store and Wal Mart but neither have had them of late.
8046;Don't waste your money!!;Of all the varieties of K-cups I have tried, I can say this has been the worst.  Don't waste your money.
8047;"Interesting.  I""m still trying it out.";24 cans come in a case.  I am caffeine sensitive, so it has been interesting getting used to it.
8048;Spicy, limey, popchips.;The Chili Lime popchips are a bit overwhelming. My friends said they couldn't really eat them by themselves, they taste better with a meal.
8049;Great Green Tea;I've tried many green teas in the same price range, but I always come back to Stash Organic Green.<br /><br />This green tea tastes how I think green tea should taste.
8050;Ho Hum Response;Any review of this product, necessarily, must be based upon observation of the four footed furry feline friends (barring any truly dedicated and odd reviewers). We have two cats that deign to call us their owners, at least at feeding time and when the litter box needs cleaning.
8051;The best you will find in the USA!;I have eaten many pounds of these peas and they are the BEST! I have also tried several other brands- they can't compete with the genuine Kasugai brand. Target's are horrid- burnt until browish, wasabi falls off and lousy flavor, taste burnt and wasabi tastes like American Horseradish, it probably is.
8052;Yummy!!;I searched for years to find these delectable treats and was so excited to finally find them on Amazon.  So smooth, very sweet, and unforgettable.
8053;Exceptional Cat Food!;Oh, this is some good cat food!<br />Have you ever opened a can of Friskies and gagged at the awful smell? How can your cat eat that?<br />This cat food smells pretty good, and it simply looks and smells like good food. My kittens made so much noise when I opened that can! They gobbled it right up, and I have to admit that it smelled pretty good.
8054;I love it!  It's now my favorite!;"My home brew beats Starbucks now with the ""Organic One Love, Ethiopian YirgaCheffe Whole Bean Coffe, 8 Ounce!""  Definitely a recommend!  <a href=""http://www.amazon."
8055;Poor gelling agent compared to name brands;You get a lot of gelatin for the money, but it isn't the same quality as name brands like Knox.<br /><br />The gelatin is much cloudier.
8056;Not bad but not great.;I was really excited about this tea but I think I fell for the attractive box. It just doesn't do much for me.
8057;Yummy;These nuts are awesome and shipped with Prime and on sale makes them even better.  They are really good nuts with just the perfect amount of salt added to make them awesome.
8058;best pop tart flavor;That's about it. It's my favorite of the pop tart flavors.
8059;Great!;I bought a cotton candy machine, but it didn't come with any floss sugar.<br />I tried using regular sugar and it was okay, but I really wanted some good colors and flavors.
8060;Addictive!;My daughter loves this. This goes very well with bread, crepe or any sort of breakfast items.
8061;Extra Virgin Coconut Oil;The Garden of LIfe Extra Virgin Coconut Oil is very thick. When mixed with hot tea or coffee it makes the beverage to thick drink.
8062;Decaf ?  Really ?;This is one of the better decaf brews I have found for the Keurig.  I found others to be bland and leave somewhat of an aftertaste.
8063;Zico Pure Premium Coconut Water;I love this coconut water. It tastes great and is healthy.
8064;Excellent Rooibos tea;I have gotten to drinking iced tea made with freshly brewed organic green, white and red (South African Rooibos) teas every day. It's relatively easy to get green and white teas that don't cost a lot, but not that easy to get organic Rooibos at a good price.
8065;AWESOME;I would buy Chia Seeds at Costco instead. It's 2 pounds for 7.
8066;Delicious!;I found these cookies at my local Costco and hesitated before finally deciding to try them. They are delicious! I have only had the cranberry, but they also have pistachio and chocolate! I am a cookie fanatic who has recently decided to start eating better.
8067;The BEST bagged tea I've ever had;My friend brought me back a box of this stuff from Ireland. I loved it so much I actually switched from being a morning coffee drinker to a morning tea drinker (Barry's ONLY!).
8068;Mmmm wonderful!;This flavoring smells amazing
8069;Awesome deal!;I have a 2oz. popper and these 2.
8070;Good for Low Carbers;I tried this product because I can no longer find (they must no longer make) the Atkins brand of low carb bake mix.  I actually do not like the consistency of this product as much, but the taste is very good and if I had not used another bake mix, the consistency would not have bothered me.
8071;Great Lap Chong!;Great purchase! I will be purchasing this product continually. It is very hard to find a USDA certified vendor for this product.
8072;The Complete Set;"After great results at a recent cook out with ""Organic Extra Virgin Olive Oil Cold Pressed, Low Acidity, Unfiltered, Mild Intensity"". See my review at http://www."
8073;Uncle Sam Cereal;I love this cereal.  I eat it dry as a snack.
8074;Lowrey's microwave pork rinds;I very much enjoy the microwave pork rinds. Scheduled deliveries make things simple and convenient.
8075;Gluten Free Macro Bars the perfect quick GF snack;These delicious Gluten-free snack bars taste like slightly sweetened nut butter and are chewy and satisfying.  Can even replace a meal in a pinch (especially breakfast).
8076;Sometimes, you can find them at a local store!;I live in a small town, but just for the heck of it, I looked at Target and Bloom. I found them at Bloom for slightly over $4.
8077;An interesting snack;I like this snack, though it is not without its negatives. First, it is expensive.
8078;Great taste, Aspartame free!;There are lots of instant, flavored beverage powers out there, some green tea, some not.  Arizona instant green tea is the only-tea based instant now that I can find that does not use Aspartame.
8079;Great tea;This tea is easy to brew, doesn't have any bitter aftertaste, and is sweet without being overly so or needing extra sugar or honey added.  Smells great in the package as well.
8080;Defective;This is the 1st K-cup coffee that I am getting grounds in my coffee. It is occuring about every 3 cups.
8081;the dogs love these - but they love all treats;If you are looking for non-wheat based treats - these are not them - the first ingredient is flour. The second is wheat meal.
8082;Great with milk and sugar, reasonably priced, strong and delicious;I grew up in the south and love a strong glass of sweet iced tea. I also like my hot tea sweet and creamy, and this tea is perfect.
8083;Our dogs love them!!!;We have two small Maltese and they absolutely love these treats. We often break them in half to make the box last a little longer.
8084;Best Gluten free bread mix so far;This is by far the best gluten free bread mix I've tried so far.  It baked quickly and turned out perfectly without huge holes all though it like other mixes have done in the past.
8085;The easiest and best;I received a Cuisinart ice cream machine for Christmas and have been enjoying creating different flavors of ice cream.  Junket ice cream mixes are difficult to beat for ease and taste.
8086;Very fresh, good price, I'll be back for more!;If you are a maple sugar candy lover, the question is frshness. Old, these can be like rocks.
8087;Zukes Hip Action;I had been buying Cosequin from my vet for my slightly overweight (OK ..
8088;Thanks Amazon;My 87 year old mother loves this soup, too-she has 1/2 can everyday for lunch. Recently supermarkets in our area stopped carrying it-I find it hard to believe it was due to lack of sales.
8089;Great toy;My dog and i love the Busy Buddy bottle.  I fill it with dog food and some treats and he spends lots of time bouncing it on the floor to get the treats out.
8090;Glorified Chocolate Milk;"So many people have written the breakdown of reGen, but the real question is: ""does this stuff work?"".  Well, for me, it wasn't too bad, but didn't make me work out any more or less than when I drink a Gatorade and eat gummy bears while working out."
8091;The tea expired a long long time ago...;The tea expired a long long time ago 2006 to be exact..
8092;Excellent training treat...;A little pricy, but worth the cost.  This is high quality stuff that can be broken into tiny pieces easily.
8093;Picture is NOT a correct representation of product!!!;The product DESCRIPTION is what everyone needs to be sure to go by when ordering. My order came in, as described, with- dark, white, milk, hazelnut and peanut butter truffles.
8094;Messy and apparently undelicious;My cat is not a huge fan. Sure, she'll lap up the gravy, but leaves the little meat-like bits as dry as a bone.
8095;garbage;All three jars were received with seals breached.  As they were unsealed, there was grease everywhere in the packaging.
8096;Tastes great!;I have a Waring Pro, and this stuff is fantastic. It is salty and buttery, and tastes like movie theater popcorn.
8097;Great Product, Great Value;High quality, organic extra virgin olive oil with a great rich taste at a great price, nothing more nothing less.  I recommend the product to all who enjoy olive oil with the added benefit of organics.
8098;Delicious;I not only enjoyed every can of this flavored sparkling water, I also enjoyed every zip of it! I recommend it. It is a reasonable price, perhaps not the cheapest but it is definitely worth it! There's no doubt that I will recommend it.
8099;Best Tasting Coconut Oil I've tried!;I have ordered and used several big name coconut oils and this is the first one I have been able to eat straight out of the jar.  It is economical and tastes great.
8100;Excellent Gluten free and Dairy Free OATMEAL!;These cookies are great, even greater since they have no gluten, no dairy, no eggs, and are light crispy and oh so good.  This is a phenomenal price too, and I love the small snack pack size!!!! Thanks Amazon.
8101;Yunmmy Cookies;I love this tasty ginger snapz cookies, so do all my non-GF friends.<br />Thanks again Pamela's.
8102;pancake and baking mix;This is the best pancake mix. I'm not allergic to wheat but I decided to try this anyway and it makes the best pancakes.
8103;Love It!!;I've tried a lot of meatless products out there and this sloppy joe mix is by far my favorite vegetarian meat alternative out there. EASY to make and we easily made seven good size sandwiches out of one box.
8104;WOWZA!!!;AWESOME~AWESOME~AWESOME!!! You must buy these!! Wonderful seller as well. FAST shipping.
8105;clg;These bars are one of the best tasting I've had.  They travel well in a purse or bag and serve as a good afternoon snack without a lot of sugar.
8106;No worries!  Received as advertised.  Great variety!;This is a nice package of Starbucks varieties.  It is hard to find a package like this.
8107;MY FAVOURITE CHOCOLATES DEMET 'S TURTLES;DEFINITELY ONE OF THE BEST CHOCOLATES OUT THERE ,I KNOW THERE ARE MANY GOOD ONE'S BUT DEMET'S IT ONE OF THE BEST ON MY PERSONAL OPINION ..
8108;Jellybeans - incredible;"I absolutely love these jellybeans.  As someone who also really likes ""jelly bellies,"" I feel Starburst and Jolly Rancher jellybeans are way better!  I never come across one of their jellybeans which I do not absolutely love."
8109;Makes Great Pastrami;I used this to make homemade pastrami. Very hard to find locally and online.
8110;Basic Lemon Ginger Herbal Tea;***<br />Stash's Lemon Ginger Caffeine Free Herbal Tea is a basic lemon ginger tea, tasting strongly of ginger, and full of flavorings, and oddly, even contains soy. This is one of the better commercial highly processed, non-organic teas.
8111;Very nice.;I wanted some bonsais but didn't really feel like caring for them or ordering a preserved tree which can be inconsistent with their looks.  All three of the trees look very real and beautiful.
8112;Disappointing;We were very disappointed in this extract.  It took way too much extract to get any kind of taste to our root beer and when we did get the taste, it wasn't pleasing.
8113;YUM!!;Let me start by saying that normally I avoid flavored coffee. However, this flavored coffee is delicious! It has a really nice vanilla smell and the taste is just as good as it smells.
8114;All-natural ingredients;What I like about his product is that I recognize all the ingredients listed on the back.  That's a lot more than I can say for most dog products.
8115;Delicious!;My father got these as a gift from work & they are absolutely delicious. Very smooth & creamy.
8116;I LOVE ZICO!;I've been very happy with the ZICO 11oz Tetra Pak from Thailand and decided to give the bottles a try. While it contains a blend of coconuts, I found the taste to be great and the bottle very convenient to use/carry.
8117;Vitacost is a good product;I like this product because of increased engery. Helping me lose a few more pounds of weight.
8118;Not my favorite!;I do not like the consistancy or flavor of this product. Its price is near double that of sunflower butter which I also purchased to replace regular peanut butter.
8119;This rice smells great!;This rice is very tasty, it also smells so good while  it's steaming. Smells like a cross between buttered popcorn and hazel nuts.
8120;Addicted to Florida's Naturals Fruit Products;I absolutely love these fruit pockets as well as the sticks.  It's a quick snack that satisfies that sweet tooth.
8121;The Lab loves them!;Our daughter's dog is allergic to chicken, so these snack treats are perfect for the pooch.  Patty loves them and they don't upset her stomach.
8122;Received expired product;"I ordered this product on June 27, 2012 and received it June 29. The best by date stickered on the package is ""030712""."
8123;Nummy Granola Bar;This is a really nummy and nutty bar with chocolate goodness.  The best granola bar that I have had and nowhere near the fat/sugar of a candy bar.
8124;A Great, Great Tea!;As one other reviewer said..
8125;best on the market;i'm not a big fan of prepared package soups (especially those awful chik-n-noodles types), but i was simply astounded by the great taste of this product - others have chimed in with their 'upgrades' to the mix, and i'll add mine:  dried mushrooms - especially the shredded wood-ears you can get at your local Asian grocery..
8126;love this product;Taking care of children for a crisis respite nursery can have it's challanges. This wonderful product can be kept on the shelf and won't spoil in a few days so it's on hand when we need it.
8127;This tuna is terrific!!!;The Starkist Chunk Light Tuna packed in *oil* has a superior, fresh flavor, not greasy, with just the right amount of salt.  The texture is firm and, unlike canned tuna, there is actually tuna in this pouch.
8128;This is the best mayo...and all natural ingredients!;Just read the ingredient list. I haven't found another mayonnaise that compares to this both in taste and in quality.
8129;Lavazza Rosa - good conventional style;I liked the Rosa, but I like a little more bold a flavor.  This espresso has a mild taste, its not bitter at all, and taste like a stonger version of a morning cup of coffee.
8130;Sweet Treat!;These Chai Honey Sticks are SO good!  I enjoy eating one or two when I have a craving for something sweet.  It also makes a fun non-sugar sweet treat for my toddler.
8131;pros: great taste. Cons: MSG;Please be careful with seasoning containing MSG.  Our bodies don't process it well & it has very bad effects on the health of our brains, esp the more sensitive amongst us.
8132;Not the best Jasmine Phoenix Pearls for sure;I bought this tea because Jasmine green tea is my favorite flavor.  I have always spend top dollars to buy the best Jamine Phoenix Pearls and have tried many different brands.
8133;Good, but we're not in Japan...;After a trip to Japan, my palate has been destroyed. I cannot find good Japanese food here.
8134;I don't like them at all but great customer service;These pods have the firmness of a teabag and it definitely shows in the cup.  I've made drip coffee thicker than this.
8135;One of the best Fontals!;I have several different Fontals and this was one of the best! Nutty and creamy. It arrived within days --- I couldn't be more satisfied.
8136;The only thing all my cats will eat!;I have three very different cats, with very different tastes. The Science Diet adult hairball formula is one all three will eat without a fuss.
8137;Read all the ingredients......awful!;Evaporated cane juice..
8138;Woop;When I received this item, immediately I read the directions and planted everything. I got about 12 seeds to sprout (I only expected one, maybe two) and they grew pretty well for a while.
8139;Taste just like store bought!!!;I am not a big coffee fan but I wanted a Keurig maker. I absolutely love Chai Latte.
8140;Not meant for my cat's whiskers;I really wanted my 2 yr old cat to like these treats because I already feed her Wellness wet food, which is excellent by itself. Perhaps she's too used to the Whiskas Temptations that I normally give her, but she did not like the jerky bits at all.
8141;M&M 12.6oz;This is a great products, kids love it.  Good for cooking!  If you buy them in the store they will cost you quite abit more for a single pack.
8142;Cans arrrived dented;I was disappointed in the condition of the cans as they arrived almost all with big dents, sometimes more than two on a can. I have heard that it isn't safe to drink from cans that have dents, so I had to research the risk and check out each can for the location of the dents.
8143;My son loves it! Very nutritional!;"This is one of my sons favorites. Even though it's called ""wholesome breakfast"" he usually has this for lunch."
8144;I don't like Hazelnut, but You Might!  I love every other Green Mountain K-Cup That I've Tried!;I gave this a 4 because there's nothing wrong with it. I just don't like Hazelnut.
8145;10 Week Old Vizsla Puppy Likes the Large;I got the large on accident and it's great for my 10 week old vizsla puppy.  He is picking it up and flinging it and just chewing away.
8146;great garbanzo beans;great garbanzo beans..
8147;RUIN YOUR LIFE;I innocently started giving these to my cats - had no idea they would begin to control my life.  Run out of treats?  you're screwed.
8148;Smooth Blend;Nice new blend. I am starting to like this one.
8149;Missing the coffee flavor, but I still love this;This is in my top five favorite K-cups. While it does taste more like hot chocolate, I brew one of these and then immediately brew the Donut Shop bold in the same cup.
8150;It's soap... For men!;"In recent years, there's been a boom in the ""for men"" category of personal hygiene products. I guess the companies figured we guys were sick of seeing women get special soaps, shampoos, razors, deodorants and skin treatments, and sought to narrow the gap by giving us men something to claim for our own."
8151;Incredible! my kids and husband loved, just add chicken.;I like to cook two cans of chicken in the spices before adding the noodles.  Everyone loves this G.
8152;Addictive;Pretzel M+Ms have filled the void that Crispy M+Ms left in my heart when they were discontinued.  If you've ever tried Pretzel Flipz, you'll know what this candy is trying to achieve.
8153;Loved it;I love this Chef Pauls NO salt NO Sugar Lemon Pepper<br />Usually when you see Lemon Pepper in the store it has too much salt<br />By the time I have it tasting enough of Lemon Pepper it is too salty<br />This one does the trick.<br />Would recommend it to anyone.
8154;life saver;Anyone who has to take medicines that constipate you, this is your saviour..
8155;Generally a good product, but quality is NOT consistent;I have ordered many tubs of fondarific in many colors, and generally don't have many problems. If you are looking for a fondant to sculpt figurines out of, this is not the fondant for you.
8156;Moode Enhancer at a Reasonable Price!;I bought this package and the pods look great. The taste is very fine and the aroma is pleasant.
8157;A nice tea alternative;I purchased these as a change-up to our inventory of teas, coffees and cocoas my wife and I drink during the cold winter months.<br /><br />As for the cider k-cups themselves, I am pleased with them overall.
8158;Favorite Jelly Beans EVER!;Love these jelly beans, I'm basically addicted to them but they are soooo expensive at the local drug store (about $4.00/bag), so I buy in bulk.
8159;Both good and bad results;On the good side it helps me with nighttime leg cramps.<br />On the bad side it gives me diarrhea.
8160;awesome;Best one yet.If you have not tried this one yet your missing out very tender and moist nuggets.
8161;Awsome!;this product was awsome
8162;All our cats love it!;I've tried a number of all natural/organic wet food brands for my fur babies, and they seem to like Newman's the best. They wont' even touch some brands, and when I'm spending over $1 per can, I can't afford to buy food they won't eat.
8163;SOOO GOOD FOR THE SKIN;THIS LAVENDER IS SOOO GOOD.IT LOOKS,SMELLS,TASTES ,AND FEELS GOOD.
8164;Best tortellini on Amazon;"I tried three tortellini products from Amazon including <a href=""http://www.amazon."
8165;Donut House Collection Light Roast K-cups;The coffee is delicious.The problem is every time we try to brew it ,it clogs my Cuisinart k-cup brewer.
8166;Pretty darn good;I just got my beans a couple days ago and made my first cup this morning, and I'm totally happy with it.  Ground the beans for my french press and made it the way I always do and it's a good cup of coffee.
8167;Disappointing;"While Bazooka lasts longer than arch-rival Dubble Bubble, the flavor of their assorted bubble gum product is astonishingly awful.  It screams ""artificial"" with every chomp."
8168;the best ever;Found Mrs. May's Bars at Smart & Final in San Jose Ca.
8169;Causes diarrhea and vomiting!! Do not buy!;I will no longer be giving these to my dog!! They caused my dog to have diarrhea and vomit! When I did some more research online, there were many many posts about how the treats caused their dogs to have similar and even much more severe health issues! My dog loves these treats. I have been giving these to her for about a year or two now.
8170;handy size, delicious product;These pineapple chunks are quite tasty--sweet and flavorful in their own juice. I think it is a fair price, too.
8171;Great full-fat pb substitute;If you're like me, then you LOVE peanut butter so much that you can't really keep it in the house.  The 'real' stuff is so full of fat and salt and hydrogenated oils that its yumminess comes at a pretty high cost.
8172;Used to be much much better;I started buying these BBQ seeds about 5 years ago.  I normally eat about a bag a day during the work week, so I love these seeds, actually loved these seeds.
8173;Very creamy, but also hydrogenated;There are so many brands to choose from when it comes to peanut butter, but when I see the name Planters, I know it's a brand I can count on. I mean who doesn't associate peanuts and Planters?<br /><br />Overall, Planters Creamy peanut butter is very creamy and I was very impressed at how easily it spreads onto bread.
8174;So Delicious...Yet my companions wont touch them.;Great chips, great price.  Odds are that you will have them to yourself.
8175;Great!;The best bar's i ever ate,although they came to the wrong address.The box came to my street address<br />but i only get mail at my P.
8176;magnifique;No offense to Starbucks, but the only way I can drink its coffee is with loads of milk to eliminate the bitterness.  Caffe Bomrad, on the other hand, has the most delicate taste while offering a rich and smooth flavor.
8177;Perfect!;I bought these to make Scrabble cookies. Over 400 cookies the size of scrabble tiles and these made writing the letter and point value on each a breeze.
8178;Gluten-free treats;Who says gluten-free can't taste great?  These little treats are tasty, bite-size snacks that are fun and delicious.  Are they healthy snacks? .
8179;Baluga Black Lentils;These beluga black lentils are delicious.  I first had them in a fine resrurant in northern Virginia.
8180;Alessi Breadsticks;We ordered Alessi breadsticks to serve as part of the snack between a wedding and reception. They were fresh, came on time, were still whole, and were a bit less expensive by the case than buying 12 individual boxes at the grocery store.
8181;the garbanzo beans in it give horrible gas;To be fair only one of my twins got gas from this but it was horrible. Up all night screaming from gas pains.
8182;Excellent product.;I tried the whole wheat chapati/roti from Indian Blend this morning and am very happy with the product.  The flavor is exactly as I expected and the texture is very tender and it holds together well in a wrap with none of the toughness I have found in similar products from other sources.
8183;a tasty, not too sweet snack;If you are looking for a nutty snack that is not too sweet, this might be for you.  My husband and I both tried them.
8184;Decaf coffee;I was curious about this coffee sold in Canada.  It's smooth.
8185;Great blend of flavor.;There's not much I can say that hasn't already been said. But when I brewed this coffee I really wasn't expecting to like it at all, seeing as I don't normally like coconut flavored things.
8186;Perfect low cal drink;For me this is Crystal Light's best flavor.  I like the tart taste as opposed to the  sweetness of many other flavors.
8187;Mystic Chai Spiced Tea;We really love this tea and it is getting harder and harder to found we can't locally.  I am very glad we found your website and you carry it.
8188;My dog loves these!;My dog loves the flavor and texture of these bones! Since they are dried, they allow that stiff resistance for bigger dogs mouths without the rawhide. Great product.
8189;Not what I expected.;My cats over the years have enjoyed catnip stuffed into socks. Both fresh and dried catnip.
8190;Peppermint Pig;Excellent product and wonderful shipping.<br />We have used this for years - part of our Christmas tradition and memories.
8191;Pretty decent;The coffee is good, but I don't know that it's extra bold. It still tastes a bit watery to me.
8192;Great Deal;Great deal, fast shipping.  Saved a lot buying these biscuits through Amazon - These biscuits are four dollars more a box at Pets Smart and other pet stores.
8193;Coffee is ...;..
8194;Not the real deal.;I was delighted when I found another sweetener that seemed to be based on stevia and not aspartame or chlorine (clorinated sugar, that is, as in Splenda). But after I used up my first box, which was not the most enjoyable experience (had a bad aftertaste), I decided to boycott the stuff.
8195;delicious!;Okay, I love my orange fingers, but if I can buy something healthier and just as good tasting THIS IS IT.<br /><br />I'm not even going to mention the absence of orange fingers.
8196;First Time Tea Drinker;I never drank tea before, then a friend bought me a Chai Tea latte.  I liked it.
8197;Dogs love the food - Premium Edge Skin & Coat Salmon, Pot & Veg;I have 2 large breeds
8198;Not bad;"The jujube sent to me was not in the same package as seen on the item's page, which belongs to another brand ""Changsi(in Chinese:&#38271"
8199;5-hour ENERGY Highly Recommend!;I absolutely love 5-hour ENERGY! I use it after work right before I head to the gym to work out and it gives me that extra boost I need to make it through my work out! The cherry and pomegranate flavors taste great. Its definitely something you should always keep in your purse and buy them in larger quantities to save money and so you dont have to buy as often.
8200;Good and Hotttttt;Tried a small bottle and used it up in no time. So bought 4 large bottles.
8201;Healthy food can taste good.;I like these bars because they are all natural and I feel like I'm getting a snack while still eating healthy.  The sugar grams are a little high, but at least they're coming from natural sources (honey, glucose) and not refined sugars.
8202;Yummy ! if not actually sushi rice;Quite tasty! No  flavorings in the rice but still a very nice light lunch. Can be a bit messy for those of us who are not skilled sushi roll wrappers.
8203;Nice flavor!;Well balanced flavor.  My husband likes strong expresso type of coffe and I don't like too strong coffee so I had to buy two different kinds of flavor before, but now we can compromise each other with this.
8204;Hard core coffee;When this coffee brew is described as dark, it is definitely not kidding. One 8 oz portion of this strong, rich coffee is enough to replace my usual two large cups of other brews.
8205;Dark Magic Coffee;I am an avid coffee drinker and like my coffee strong and black. When I order coffee, I all ways  order the darkest and richest roasts.
8206;What a BARGIN!!;$7.99/# at Fralingers stores - $10.
8207;Nice strong coffee;Normally get French roast but this was a good price. Very happy with the taste, nice and strong and no weird taste.
8208;Worms!;I purchased two bags of these Wonderful Pistachios, and both of the bags I received were good.  So, I ordered them again.
8209;Good full-flavored coffee for Senseo;Love the advantages of Senseo: fresh, what-I-want when-I-want coffee. But the quality of the pods is sometimes short of my preferences.
8210;Excellent Product;I use arrowroot as a 1 for 1 replacement for cornstarch in my gluten free cooking.  It's a perfect replacement as I have diet where there is some sensitivity to corn.
8211;Healthy tree and packaged well;"I received my Dawn Redwood Bonsai yesterday, and I was impressed on how big it was. From the base of the plant to the top it stands at about 24""."
8212;Revised and Yummy;I have purchased and tried all Happy Baby products and have liked them all (or at least my children have liked them all).  I really enjoy reading peoples' product reviews to see what they think of the products that I am thinking of buying.
8213;Tea Consumer;I was looking for a quality tea sampler that I could share at work and consume at home. The taste of the teas are good.
8214;the best sauce ever for shishkabobs and much more;most people think to have the best tasting shish ka bobs you must marinate over night. but with this sauce marinating is over.
8215;Not The Item I Ordered;While I'm sure the coffee I received is a good coffee, it is NOT what I ordered.  I ordered Emeril's Jazzed Up Decaf, but received Robust Bold.
8216;Too much chocolate!  Never thought I'd say it,;"but ""Chips Ahoy! Chewy Gooey Megafudge"" is TOO MUCH chocolate.  Seriously."
8217;Yeast Extract = MSG, They DO Contain Preservatives!;"Just an FYI that ""Yeast Extract"" is one of the titles that MSG hides behind. MSG IS a preservative and a dangerous one at that."
8218;Hotel Waffles at Home!;I started by buying the Presto 03510 FlipSide Belgian Waffle Maker here on Amazon. We experimented with the Presto and Epicurious recipes and cooking times.
8219;May not SOUND very good but it IS!;This chai is wonderful - the BEST I've ever had.  It is super easy to make and so relaxing to drink.
8220;Delicious! Better than Jelly Belly!;I bought these for my wife after a co-worker shared some with her. She was surprised and excited when they arrived.
8221;Great for a buck;The price on these fell to a $1, so I bought 20 of them.  I'm pretty sure they lost money on that deal.
8222;Love these!;These are my favorite mints because they do not contain sugar or artifical sweeteners. I like the vanilla flavor the best.
8223;Best Steak Seasoning Ever;This is the best steak seasoning I've ever found in a store.  I've established a great reputation for my steaks based on this seasoning.
8224;I am not sure whether men need this...;"I am not sure whether many men would use ""Dove + Men Care Clean Comfort Body Wash."" At least for me (a middle aged & married man), I am used to just washing my body with a bar of soap."
8225;taste great!;I love this tea! My wife is usually the big tea drinker in the house but after trying this in my Keurig I have to say I LOVE it. I didn't purchase through amazon though because I got the same amount 24 in a box for only 9.
8226;Unlike my trial;When I bought my sodastream it came with a bunch of trial packs and this was one of my favorites in the trial size. But now no matter how I mix it with this full size bottle, it doesn't taste the same.
8227;Great Tasting Sardines;I love theses sardines, no skin and good tasting. I buy a lot of these sardines.
8228;WEAK;I thought this might be a good back up for when I run out of Keurig cups, but I find it be really weak coffee. It doesnt really work that well in the coffee maker so I use it as a kind of teabag.
8229;Tastes Like Diner Coffee;This is not a dark roast. The packaging may be pretty but the coffee is terrible.
8230;Wow, amazing!;Wow, this is amazing tea!!!<br />Ok, frankly speaking, I gave this a try just because this had a very good price during friday sale. I like every tea but I am not a big tea drinker.
8231;Kool-Aid for adults!;Blackberry Pomegranate has never let me down before when it comes to flavored drinks.  When I saw this offering and it claimed to be natural I became very interested.
8232;Not as I expected;I don't think I'd buy these particular treats again, but I do like the Zuke's treats for my puppy. These were a weird texture, and I had to tear them apart and they are of a paper-like consistency.
8233;Awesome Service;Wanted to let you know the Orijen dog foods help so much with my dog's scratching.  Also, thanks for the quick shipping and free samples.
8234;VERY TASTY CRACKERS;Crackers are great.  They come in a small enough package so they don't get stale either but I can't seem to put them down until they are almost gone.
8235;High Protein, Low Fat, Tast Great. Expensive.;I was skeptical but this product is all its cracked up to be. Tastes great and works well in use.
8236;Dogs love 'em, I love 'em;My dogs love them. They smell pretty intensely which is always good.
8237;Great product! No experience required!;I bought these for an event where I had to have different people cooking a lot of popcorn quickly. All you have to do is dump in the ingredients and go.
8238;Just OK;This item is just OK.  It does make a 16 ounce glass of iced coffee, however it could be stronger both in the vanilla and the coffee.
8239;Awesome bully sticks - long-lasting, flavorful and not too smelly!;I've bought dozens of these bully sticks for my dog and as gifts for others.  All the dogs love them and spend hours chewing on them!  Since they're thick and have three strands, some of the dogs unravel the braid and eat one strand at a time.
8240;Be warned;This stuff is really smelly and disgusting looking. Of course, my cat loves it.
8241;Many Uses;Not only will this thicken and season stews, gravies and soups,<br />but I use it to coat chicken before sauteing as well.  Its<br />the perfect blend of flavor and coating.
8242;Jelly Bellies for a Jelly Belly;Jelly Bellies the best Jelly Bean only gets better when buying a ten pound box. Price per pound drops real low.
8243;Amazing stuff;Hands down, this is the best cacao I've ever tried - smooth and flavorful, with no chalky after-taste.  Spend the extra money on this and don't even bother with the brown stuff in the can at the grocery store.
8244;DO NOT BUY!!;If you want coffee grounds floating in every cup of coffee, and K-cups that explode open in your Keurig, then this product is for you. I have used about a dozen of these K-cups so far, and about half have come open inside my Keurig, with the top foil seal coming off and the water and grounds going everywhere.
8245;Best seasoning around!;My father has use this seasoning since I can remember. When I moved to the United States I had my father send it to me every six months.
8246;Best Honey;I love this Honey! My son told me raw honey was better for you so I finally found it in a local grocery. It was very expensive.
8247;LUV THE LIDS;LUV LUV LUV EM CAN REUSE MY K CUPS AND LIDS MAKES EVERYTHING MORE WORTHWHILE THE LIDS ARE MADE REALLY WELL THEY FIT GREAT AND I THINK THE LIDS CAN BE REUSED TOO. GREAT IDEA! THANK YOU AMAZON TOO FOR HAVING A GREAT ASSORTMENT TO CHOOSE FROM.
8248;Extra energy;I am so happy I found the KIND bars at Amazon.com.
8249;Great Figs;I've always been a fan of Figs, and these are the best I've tasted.  I don't like the dates and apricots as much but even if I could buy the Figs by itself, I'd probably still go for this mixed pack since it becomes a snack with a bit more variety and texture.
8250;Super Soup;Surprised pleasantly by this product which I originally purchased locally here in AZ for $1.39 a package [got two for the trial].
8251;WATCH OUT FOR SHIPPING COSTS;SERIOUSLY PEOPLE ???<br /><br />$7.00 S&H on a $3.
8252;Very Happy with Product;I am very happy with this product. Not only is it organic without any by-products but my 2 older cats love it! I bought a case shipped and sold by Amazon LLC so I got free shipping and a good price.
8253;Beyond bitter;I'm new to Stevia and try to eat only natural (non-chemical), real foods. It's too good to be true that something with zero calories would taste great.
8254;Better than Top Ramen;In my opinion they have to be the best noodles ever. They're seasoned well and not too spicy.
8255;Best Tea Ever!;I'm obsessed with this tea..
8256;Great for dogs with sensitive stomachs;I have a dog with chronic diarrhea. I have tried many different brands and this is the only food she can eat that doesn't upset her stomach.
8257;Gluten Free;This is a great gluten free cracker!<br />Pricing was better than I can find locally.<br />Each box has 2 foil sealed bags for freshness.
8258;yummy;These are really delicious cookies and they are far healthier than most of the junk in the stores.  They are full of all natural ingredients, no high fructose or additives here.
8259;my dachshund loves these;my dachshund, like all dachshunds, will eat anything and everything. Treats need to be very small for her so that she doesn't put on weight and she loves these.
8260;It grows on you;The first time I drank Fenagreek Seed tea I did not like the smell or the taste very much.  I added a very small amount of Stevia to sweeten it.
8261;it sucks;It took me almost fifteen days to get the candies.<br />It tasted not like the soda candies I had before.
8262;pricey;Have purchased the same item at Costco for 60% of the price from this vendor--same experience with most other products of this type, to say nothing of nuts.  Go to Costco.
8263;Love these!;I took a chance on these and they are awesome.  They are crisp and not at all greasy.
8264;Not a K-cup but works in a Keurig;As the other reviewers have said, this is not a K-cup! I uploaded an image of one of these pods next to a K-cup for comparison. The difference is the filter is exposed in these pods as opposed to being fully sealed in a K-cup.
8265;Good Product!;I like Fig Newtons and have been missing them since I cut out white flour and enriched flour from my diet. These are made with whole grain and taste very good.
8266;Best 100% Whole Wheat Pasta;There is no other whole wheat pasta I will buy. It tastes delicious and doesn't have a dense wheat flavor.
8267;A Favorite Tea!;This tea is amazing!  It is great for those new to tea and enjoyed by this tea enthusiast.  The flavor of the strawberry is very true and fragrant.
8268;Better than Wheat Pasta;Tinkyada makes excellent pasta, regardless of whether you must eat gluten-free or not.  It is NOT mushy or gritty as one other reviewer noted
8269;Almost too strong!;My biggest gripe with the Keurig pods is that the coffee is too weak so I always try the bold varieties.  I think I met my match with this one though.
8270;gluten free and great!;I have tried a lot of bread mixes and most are hard and only good for 1-2 days. Pamela's bread mix is soft and lasts a week.
8271;These are the best chips ever;I absolutely love these chips.  All the flavors are great, but my favorites are Plain, Cheddar and Sour Cream & Onion.
8272;The Best Earl Grey Bagged Tea I have Had;This tea is flavorful and delicious and became an instant favorite from the first time I have tried it. Stash Earl Grey started me into experiencing tea beyond iced and typical restaurant fare.
8273;Very tasty and healthy jerky snack!;Hi! I could eat a box of this vegan jerky at one sitting. Delicious! The hickory smoke flavor is mildly hot without burning.
8274;Triplets love this!;This is great!  It smells great!  I love all of the vegetables in it.  Texture is not chunky and is eaten very well by my triplets, even the one with just 4 teeth.
8275;Such Good Value;Coconut oil has been a recent discovery for us this last year and we are really enjoying cooking with it. The health benefits are enormous.
8276;Pleased;Pure, fresh with mild coconut scent and very slight flavor. Product arrived in good condition in clean containers with no leaking as suggested in another review.
8277;Sprout Master;The biggest disadvantage to the sprout master is that i found it difficult to get rid of the hulls - it seems  to be much easier with a jar and screens. However, the sprouts seem to store well in the sprout master - they stay fresh a long time.
8278;Great taste, high price;I purchased these at Trader Joe's.  If you like cacao nibs they taste great.
8279;Where's the Kona taste?;I can't taste any Kona flavor in this blend.  It's not a bad coffee, but sorry.
8280;Best simple cat food;My cat that can eat fish loves this food!  I was concerned as well about tuna on a regular basis, but then learned that the tuna in the Pacific has much less mercury than that which is caught in the  Atlantic.  Along with the fact that my super finicky cat loves this keeps me buying it.
8281;Great Chips!;I absolutely love Pop Chips.  Cheddar is my favorite, but I thought I'd try these cause I like Parmesan too.
8282;Easy lunch or snack.;I'm a busy mom on the go so when I saw the GoPicnic products I had to try them.  The Hummus + Crackers is my favorite even though I'm not a vegetarian.
8283;"GF snacks, ""Just the Cheese""";Yay! I used to be able to find these at local grocers in the midwest and have been missing them since my move east. I love this exceptionally salty, crunchy snack.
8284;Great stuff!;This protein powder has a pleasant taste, dissolves well and is not gritty.  I am enjoying it in many recipes or even by itself in water.
8285;very yummy hot cocoa!;we have bought several types, brands of hot cocoa k cups. These our definitely one of the best! They have a great flavor and everyone in my house liked them, even my 9 year old who only likes some hot cocoa loved this.
8286;Swedish Fish;These are the BEST I've ever had. Family always ends up with 1/2lb to 1lb because they ask if I ordered anymore.
8287;Great Kids Snack;We eat these everyday around our house. A great alternative to fruit roll-ups.
8288;My husband loves cookies made with this and he does not need gluten free!;I made chocolate chip cookies, peanut butter cookies, and brownies with Pamela's Baking and Pancake mix. My husband pined for more brownies.
8289;Hodgson Mill Bread Mix Is Great Stuff!;Hodgson Mill makes a fantastic array of bread mixes<br />that are easy and fun to make.  I buy the European<br />Cheese & Herb to make the most heavenly pizza crusts<br />with.
8290;The cats prefer Kong but this will do;"I have gone through several <a href=""http://www.amazon."
8291;Delicious, but not for those watching sodium;This chicken is moist and delicious. It is seasoned enough to eat right out of the can.
8292;CLAMATO / PICANTE;"I am a long time fan of Clamato juice as just a juice drink or as a base for my Bloody Marys' and was intrigued by the possible ""spiciness"" of this new product.<br /><br />I was sorely disappointed by the lack of ""spiciness""."
8293;Not bad;Not a bad hot sauce, but I suppose my expectations were higher.  I had it on eggs, but it tasted more like barbecue sauce.
8294;Finally found the perfect cat food.;"After reading other reviews I decided to see if this product could reduce ""Sophie's"" problem of throwing up her food.  She had been on Science Diet ""oral care"" for years and seemed to do well on it, except for not being able to keep it down 2-4 times per month."
8295;Hot Spots can be from food allergies;After spend $$$$ and several years of trying to find out what was creating fur loss (hot spots) and itching on my poor dog, it all came down to food allergies. This food is wonderful.
8296;great flavor;This is great coffee especially if you like a bold flavor.  If you use this product you will be satisfied.
8297;The ENERGY drink is the only one I can tolerate, and I love that one!;We got a Sodastream for Christmas. My kids have lots of fun making soda, and for them it's really become a passed-fad already and it's only July.
8298;SPICY BUT NOT GOOD;I LOVE SPICY STUFF AND THIS SAUCE IS DEFINITELY SPICY BUT THE FLAVOR IS JUST NOT GOOD, PERIOD.<br />IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR A FLAVORFUL HOT SAUCE, THIS IS NOT IT.
8299;Amazing!;These are AMAZING!  I have a very slippery and sneaky cat who needed medication before a trip.  I stuck the little tablet inside the snack, put two down on the floor, and she ate them both.
8300;White Peppercorn;I thought that the white pepercorn was such a deal. The only place in town that carried white peppercorn is Whole Food with costs 6.
8301;I love this tea;When ran out of this tea I went back to get this one but I couldn't find it no more. So I bought another one and I see the difference.
8302;Strong Coffee;This flavor coffee is the only one I can find that is strong enough to handle the large mug size without getting weak.  It took forever to be shipped, though.
8303;Really tasty...;I love this stuff.  You can make it with milk or almond milk and put some whipped cream on top, it's amazing.
8304;Tasty Tea;I drink lots of tea, and I must say that this is a pretty enjoyable variety. The flavor is deep and hearty, and creates a nice dark brew.
8305;An excellent Kona blend.;The Diamond II is great. Rich but very smooth, not bitter at all.
8306;INcredible cake!;I'm giving this 5 stars but only if you're experienced in handling a really slack, soft dough and because it's so complete, authentic and VERY good tasting.  It really should only give it 4 stars because the yeast was dead - so proof it before you rely on it!  I put it in my bread machine on the 'dough' cycle and when it got all done and ready to form, it was flat as a flitter.
8307;Organic Hard Red Wheat Seed;The Wheat seed is perfect. I planted some of it and it grew very fast.
8308;Nothing I tasted can compare...;I have been on this journey to find healthy alternative(s)for quite some time.  I was reading in a book about flushing the fat and this was the only substitute recommended
8309;Great product - perfect for gluten free households;We use gluten free bisquick for many different things - biscuits, pancakes, etc.  Tastes good & lets us serve our kids that are gluten free the same thing as the whole family.
8310;Surprisingly ineffective compared to cheaper brands...;It tastes allright, but that's not why we use it.  Acai berries are famous for their antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effect.
8311;Light & Greek;Well, I like anything with feta in it. This salad dressing is a great light option, especially since there aren't many light greek dressings on the market.
8312;Tasty!  But....;if you are looking for big Oreo taste, these are not going to give it to you.  There is only one Oreo wafer in these, AND the wafer isn't even as thick as one side of a regular Oreo.
8313;Happy Dog;My dog LOVES this food. He follows us around at meal time till he gets his food and then never leaves his dish till it's gone.
8314;Good gel, misleading picture;After receiving this item I was taken aback by the size of the container.  I bought it when I was in a hurry and didn't read the size indicated in the description, which was accurate.
8315;Kids approve;This was a life saver while watching my nephews. I wasn't sure what to make for dinner while keeping track of an 18 month old so the one skillet made it a breeze to cook and clean up.
8316;PRODUCT OF CHINA;some of the fruits are noted to be from china.  in light of recent concerns r/t how fruits are raised/maintained.
8317;Applesauce Spice Cake;As I was growing up my mother always made apple sauce cake for every birthday and special occasion.  After I was diagnosed with celiac I began trying to make a cake that was like the one my mother made.
8318;unbelievably delicious;these meal replacement bars rock!!! 300 calories per bar, packed with over 20 grams of protein. And the taste is superb.
8319;Simply amazing;This stuff is great. I had my doubts when I ordered it but the taste is great.
8320;my favourite tea;I agree with the other reviewer, except that I think it's *three times* as good as Lipton.  I also prefer it to PG Tips, another English tea.
8321;Not like advertised;I was excited to try this product with it's claims of no after taste. Thought i might not have to use as much either, as erythritol, to get same sweet taste.
8322;Great Flavor!;I am an Earl Grey fan, and had tried many different brands.  Once I tried Stash, I never needed to check another.
8323;World's best chocolate, BAR none.;"Corny title, but it's true.  I've been all over the world, tried ""gourmet"" chocolates, white chocolates, truffles, dark chocolates, etc."
8324;Very good flavor, but miss the old pack sizes;We prefer flavored coffees and as far as those go, this is a very good.  Just a touch of sweetness resembling Butter Toffee, and a balanced amount of caffeine.
8325;Jelly Belly Theses Are Not!;These jelly beans would probably taste great if you never had a Jelly Belly jelly bean.  They are too sweet and too chewy for my taste.
8326;Yummy!;I love pumpkin so I was dying to try this and was so please!!  It's just the right amount of pumpkin flavor and the coffee itself it just perfect, not weak and not too strong.  I add pumpkin pie creamer to my cup and it tastes just like a Starbuck Pumpkin Latte.
8327;Finally!;I've asked for this flavor in three local groceries..
8328;Ridiculous price;I ordered three of these thru amazon prime, no longer available as of 11-15-11. My last order was oct 4th 2011 and price was $26.
8329;Great Soy Sauce Substitute;We have used Bragg Liquid Aminos for years in our family.  It is a great soy sauce substitute that is lower in sodium and unfermented.
8330;Good Coffee w/ a subtle Blueberry Taste;This is a good tasting flavored coffee. The blueberry taste could be a little stronger and the roast could be a little stronger as well, but the light roast does make for a good morning coffee to wake you up and the blueberry flavor makes this a good breakfast coffee as well.
8331;I like it .. BUT ..;..
8332;Good bread for those on Gluten Free & Dairy Free Diet;My son is on a gluten free, casein free (GFCF) diet and eats quite a bit of this bread.  Like the another poster has said, if you are Gluten Free only, I suppose you have quite a few options these days.
8333;"Class A ""T&uuml";
8334;Not that great;"I am a a vegetarian, and this is my least favorite ""jerky"".  The texture is sort of slimey and after a couple bites, I had had enough."
8335;Brittle thin treats;I use treats for obedience and agility classes.  I need a treat that is not crunchy, but chewy and capable of breaking up into small bits.
8336;Great Snack!;I bought this for the first time last week and love it! It's a great grab-and-go snack that's pretty healthy but tastes like a treat. Highly recommend.
8337;Yum!  but a little pricey for chips.;I really like the flavor and cruch of these chips. It just about makes the price worth it.
8338;misc salt;This product looked wonderful and priced well.  In actuality, it was poorly boxed, bottles were broken, and it was a mess inside the box.
8339;My new favorite!;I had not heard of this brand before, and happened upon it in my local grocery store.  The lower price for a box of 12 cups made me take notice, so I thought I'd try it.
8340;Corn is good.;I liked this product. I eat popcorn all the time and this brand is my favorite.
8341;Best deal 've found;This was the best deal on Splenda that I've found.  It was shipped fast and I have been dipping into it ever since it arrived.
8342;Like a chewable vitamin;Disclaimer: I have not yet met an Annie's Bunnies product I did not like.  I don't know what it is, but I go wild for cheddar bunnies, sour cream bunnies, bunny crackers, etc.
8343;Duration of treat depends on your dog...;We have a chow mix who's never occupied for long.  I read the reviews on this one and had hoped to keep her busy for an hour or two.
8344;Very nice! Just the right size!;I am quite fond of this k-cup organizer! I sort with the 3 drawers<br /><br />* Sturdy & Smart<br />* Easy to use and clean<br />* Came assembled<br /><br />For now anyway, this is how I'm using it..
8345;best formula for my baby;Our daycare uses this formula as the default (if you don't provide your own), which is what promted us to try it out. Our daughter (although she can't talk to tell us for sure) likes it.
8346;YUM!!!;I bought this larger size because I drink a gallon of iced tea a day. Buying this saves lots of money, compared to buying the smaller boxes at the market.
8347;Purchased from Amazon - Good Flavor, great price;I read the reviews and thought to give these a try. They arrived in a timely manner (prime membership).
8348;Great alternative to regular organic milk and organic soy;I can only eat and drink organic so finding this made my life. I love having a little bit of chocolate treats here and there and this is nice to have and you feel a bit less guilty because it's healthier for you.
8349;Yuck;I LOVE the peanut butter flavor, but these are disgusting and gritty. They taste like a chewy bar version of flintstones vitamins, and the coating on the outside is even worse.
8350;Great tasting granola!;I've seen Bob's Red Mill products before but never purchased them, but when I saw this on a lightning deal I had to buy it.  It is really tasty and hearty.
8351;Itchy scratchy golden retriever no more;This food is the best.  Our golden retriever who is prone to all sorts of allergies is scratch free with this food.
8352;Good Taste, Pleasant Aroma;Gevalia Dark Chocolate Mix smelled great straight from opening the product.  Once brewed, the taste may not have lived up to the aroma but still a decent choice on a cold day to warm up and worth adding to a rotation if you like variety in your coffee flavors.
8353;Love Via!;I truly love this product and always carry it with me when I travel.  My only complaint is the packaging used on the product which is sold at Costco, which contains 24 packets.
8354;amazing and healthy;My trainer gave me one of these treats to try during agility class and it was amazing. It got my dogs attention right away.
8355;Some are so hard they will break your teeth!!;Tried these the other day, put some in my mouth and some colors are so hard they are like rocks. Next thing I know, I had a broken molar and over $1000 in dental work.
8356;Great for picky eaters;My dog is the pickiest eater and does not enjoy many treats but he goes crazy over this one. It helps freshen his breath but I don't know how to evaluate the cleaning ability of this product.
8357;Wellness Chicken Stew;The ratings for this food are among the highest and my Labrador LOVES this stuff!  I feel very good giving him this high quality food and am glad that my picky eater wants something that is so good for him.  It's chunky and you can see peas, carrots, potato, and, of course, the chunks of meat.
8358;A whole new world!;I received a bottle of Olio Taibi from a friend as a gift. Up until now, I had only used EVOO purchased from the local grocery store and had not thought much about it.
8359;Fantastic tasting healthy or not!;These chips are great for snacking regarless that they are healthy!  They don't taste like health food but they are.  I love the vinegar and sea salt the best.
8360;Just like in Grade school;It tastes just like I think it did in grade school.  Delicious.
8361;The best ever;These are the best gluten free cookies I have eaten.  They are wonderful.
8362;best on the market;Every morning, I have hot chocolate mixed with instant coffee and some cinnamon. This is a great choice because it is only 25 calories a packet, with 30% of your daily calcium requirement.
8363;the best;I dont mind paying a little extra because my dog loves these and I like that it only has two ingredients. Its well worth the investment.
8364;Excellent spice.;This is an excellent salt-free spice. It has a really nice blend of flavors that go well with just about any dish.
8365;Certified organic liver for my dog! I'm very glad this product is on the market.;UPDATE:<br />The company determined that the product I received was defective in some way. They speculated it got too hot during storage or shipping.
8366;Cat that likes everything doesn't like this...;My cat is not a picky eater and eats nearly anything. However, he really does not like the taste of this food.
8367;Good Product, does not fully cook in under 15 minutes;I am a distance runner and depend on beans and corn for my main source of carbs as I have insensitivities that causes body inflammation when I eat rice or gluten (wheat).<br /><br />PROS:<br />These beans are great, organic, sprouted, tastey and I have no food insensitivities with them.
8368;Better Oats RAW Pure & Simple;Great flavor in this oatmeal. I love the simplicity for preparing the oatmeal, cold water filled to the designated line on the individual pouch, microwave for 60 seconds.
8369;Nice color but not so sparkly;Purchased this lavender sugar to put on lavender sugar cookies. The cookies were great, but the lavender shgar wasn't that sparkly.
8370;delightful, light biscuit-type cookie;"I brought these with me to work, and they were universally enjoyed. ""Any more?"" was the repeated request, and I was sorry myself when they were all gone."
8371;Good taste;Price is good along with the taste.  I like the dark, rich flavor.
8372;Long Standing Favorite!;I have known these butter cookies for close to 18 years, since a lovely French lady..
8373;LOVE THIS STUFF!;Happened upon this in a natural store to use in place of fresh lime (that they were out of) to be used in a fresh, low-calorie margarita. As it turns out, this stuff is incredibly, deliciously perfect as a margarita base! I now make one of the best lower-calorie, mostly-organic margaritas on this earth! True, it is tart (unsweetened and virtually no calories) so if you like a sweet taste, add some sweetener (sucralose or stevia.
8374;Delicious cookies!;These are light and crispy and tart but sweet.  We originally ordered them in a fundraising catalog, and when they were gone, I had to hunt them down on the web.
8375;New toys for Jake;The Castor & Pollux Curious Cat Organic Catnip toys have turned out to be my wee Jake's favorite toy. Being small they are easily transported from room to room, which he will do most nights.
8376;Wish the taste lasted longer;The Green tea flavor is great and refreshing, but it only lasts a few minutes.  I always chew gum in the gym, as it helps with breathing, and found this gum lost its flavor and got hard after only a couple sets.
8377;Donut House Collection Donut House Decaf;What I thought I ordered were 24 Decaf Donut House K Cups.  What I received was a variety of K cups not all Decaf.
8378;TOOOOOOOOOOOOO expensive!!!!!!!!;What!!!!!!!! $6.38 + $8.
8379;YUMMMMMMMMM!!!!;I just received this item yesterday, April 27th, and I have been munching on them off and on since then.  They taste SO GOOD that it's hard to stop with just one!  *SMILE*  As I was munching, this food reminded me of Vanilla Wafers with cranberries in it.
8380;It's All About the Jerk;I 1st purchased this on a trip to Jamaica a couple years ago and became worried when my supply began running low.  But thanks to Amazon I was able to find it at a great price with great shipping.
8381;ordering  (hard-to-find) Badia Cinnamon Powder;no more stress looking for this item in the stores!!!<br />We will order it thru amazon.com from now on, fast service,<br />fast delievery, good price.
8382;Stains Everything;This is a delicious tea.  I bought a canister of it at Whole Foods, and used most of it up pretty quickly.
8383;Best Vegan dog I've had;I'm a vegetarian trying to be vegan. My kids and I love linketts and prefer them to any vegan dog we have tried yet.
8384;NOT A GOOD TEXTURE - DON'T CARE FOR THESE;DON'T LIKE THE TEXTURE OF THESE SMOKED OYSTERS - ALSO THE TASTE IS LACKING. I'VE TRIED MANY BRANDS OF SMOKED OYSTERS OVER THE YEARS & THESE JUST TASTE STRANGE AS WELL AS FEEL ODD WHEN CHEWING THEM.
8385;Excellent chestnuts available in the US;Briefly, I agree entirely with the previous reviewer.  I have tried a few sources of fresh chestnuts and several brands and types of peeled chestnuts (in water, in syrup, dry, etc.
8386;Fantastic!;Best Energy bar ever..
8387;so fragile, breaks easy and fly comes out of it if it breaks;it is using plastic cup so fragile and cheap.  Much weaker than normal plastic disposable cup.
8388;Chocalate rice;This is a very good product, I am extremely satisfied especially since I have Gluton intolerance. Thanks for the great product.
8389;YUMMY!;I love these bars!  It is hard to find decent gluten-free snacks, and, these are a treasure!  They are packed with crunchy nuts and sweet fruit.  I like that they are all natural, too.
8390;Just as good as on the flight!;They are just as good as on my recent plane trip.  My only issue is limiting myself to say 4 cookies at a time.
8391;Verbatim replacement for Kraft Mac and Cheese;I was looking to replace the Kraft Mac and Cheese powder that comes packaged with the macaroni noodles.  I used this with rigatoni, macaroni, and ramen noodles and it tastes JUST like the Kraft version.
8392;Excellent quality re-hydrate in a flash;These are excellent quality dried mushrooms. They rehydrate in hot water (no need to use boiling hot water) in no time at all.
8393;Try for yourself;Some of these reviews crack me up!  Obviously the directions were not read or followed.  The noodles are put in a solution that does smell 'fishy', BUT it says that and it also says to rinse in warm water for 3-5 minutes, not 15 seconds.
8394;Best Tasting Wheat Spaghetti!!!;I was looking for a wheat spaghetti made with nothing but Durham whole wheat flour . .
8395;wonderful and price so right;they were on sale and what a deal plus I always purchase them at the regular grocery store so shared them with family.  I love cooked pudding over instant and it was great having so many on hand when the milk was low and wanted to use it before I opened the new milk container.
8396;Community Coffee is the best;I tried Community Coffee at a friends house a few months back. He gave me a bag of whole beans and I took it home to try.
8397;Incorrect information;At the time of purchase, the production description stated:<br /><br />Blue Diamond Natural Cinnamon Brown Sugar Oven Roasted Almonds 8 oz<br />by Blue Diamond<br />Be the first to review this item  Like (0)<br />List Price: $32.55<br />Price: $6.
8398;Too expensive here;I just bought this syrup from sodastream's site for 9.99 and there was also a coupon that let me get one syrup free.
8399;teatime;I drink only pg tips tea. It is hard to find decaf locally and pg tips is the only kind of decaf I like and I need to cut back on the caffeine for health reasons.
8400;Very difficult company-bad customer service;very bad customer service.<br />my mother who is 86 years old bought one for her grandson who happens to be in the Army.
8401;Pretty Good;I can eat 3 or 4 chips fairly full of the stuff before I have to quit.<br />Pretty hot stuff [and I LOVE hot stuff] but the flavor is really good.
8402;Delicious Coffee!!!;Unlike my husband, I love the Creme Brulee'k cups.  He hates flavored coffees.
8403;orange spice in black tea is great;This is the finest tea we've ever tasted, good any time of the day, or night for that matter. We'll be enjoying it for many months.
8404;The price was right;I am not the the cook in the family so I can't really comment on the product itself except to say my wife asked me to find and buy this specific product.  As is often the case Amazon was by far the best deal when you can use the quantity.
8405;Ok but I've had better;Tasted my first 8 ounce cup with the usual amount of sugar. It's fair I guess for a medeum roast coffee but homestly I've had better & I won't be buying any after my 15 count pack runs out.
8406;great hot or iced;This mint medley has a delightful mint tea taste and works well as in iced tea.  Being decaf is a great bonus.
8407;Excellent service!;Product is just as described and arrived fast! Will purchase again soon. Very well packaged and stores perfectly.
8408;PERFECT FOR EVERYTHING!!;Great for sweetening coffee and oatmeal. I have found many amazing things to do with muscovado sugar and I will never go back to artificial sweeteners again!!<br /><br />Another one I constantly use is the brand called EL MAESTRO and I usually buy it on ebay.
8409;Bold Coffee Lovers - You'll Love This!;Dark Magic is one of my favorite Keurig coffees. I love a dark roast, full bodied coffee - and this one delivers.
8410;Super yummy!;My teenagers love these bars. They are chewy and sweet bars that are just filling and tasty enough to keep them perfectly satisfied until dinner.
8411;Best Instant Ever;This is simply the best instant coffee I have ever tasted. It is smooth with little to no acidic aftertaste.
8412;Great K-Pods;I love this flavor. I've tried a lot of flavored k-pods and this one is the most subtle and delicious.
8413;Best of the lot;When I first got my keurig, I got the big variety pack that came with it and found that I hated most of them.  All were much too strong and often bitter.
8414;perfect for the bristling sardine lover;My local grocery store stopped carrying Bristling Sardines, No salt added, packed in water.<br /><br />This product is it!<br /><br />I prefer smaller sardines than this company packs
8415;Tastes good! Perhaps a little high in fat, though it's mostly from seeds & nuts.;Overall, I found this granola quite appealing. Seemed like more granola than clusters, or maybe the clusters all just settled to the bottom of the pouch? 
8416;Very pleased;Great for road trips and dealing with peanut allergies.  It's a great idea that I've been looking for when traveling for quite some time now.
8417;Great alternative for sugar;It's a great buy. It tastes sweeter than sugar and has none of the bitterness of Splenda.
8418;Good Product;My household goes through a lot of baking soda from baking to cleaning, this is a great multi use product. I could get it cheaper from the local grocery store by 3 dollars if I would have purchased 3 large boxes but living in a smaller space we are trying to cut down of bulk, so this stores nicely.
8419;Great taste, winning idea;Each tea bag comes in its own individual baggie so you don't have to worry about tasting the bitter loose tea leaves in your tea. It's a great idea and one that hopefully catches on.
8420;Love them, BUT NOT ALL FLAVORS;We really love Popchips or at least we love the BBQ and the Orginal. Good and crunchy without all the fat and calories.
8421;Effective protein & Fiber, though not versatile;When I first opened the bag, I was thrown off by the strong aroma, somewhat reminiscent of sage. However, this aroma died down within a couple of days.
8422;Yum. Great Flavor.;This was really good. Being a single guy, the easier the meal the better and this was super simple to make and tasted wonderful.
8423;Smooth;As coffee in a can goes, this is pretty darn good stuff.  The flavor is smooth with a slight creaminess, and there's absolutely no bitterness.
8424;Good peas;I just rec'd my 5lb bag.  The packaging survived the trip to Afghanistan - so no worries there.
8425;No Smell;I have one cat and because I hate it so much do not change the litter box as much as I should. Since I have been using these over regular scoopable litter I NEVER smell the cat box.
8426;I'll take my cake without MOLD on it;..
8427;My Breakfast Cookies!;I have been eating the Quaker Breakfast Cookies most mornings for several years.  I am an early riser and very early in the morning I like to have my coffee along with my breakfast cookie.
8428;SALTY!!!;These tomatoes are inconsistently salted.  Some are so salty, and others are moderately salty.
8429;Use it everyday!;"First of all, this stuff gives you energy, without the ""cracked out"" feeling other energy products give you. I drink it everyday to get me going."
8430;Deliciously Peaceful;This tea is a step up from a regular chamomile.  The blend is unique and of good quality.
8431;"Too Strongly Flavored & ""Watermelon"" is the LAST Ingredient!";"The flavor name of this ""The Switch"" drink is ""Watermelon Strawberry.""  I thought there was a law in what you put for the beginning names of a flavor -- it is supposed to be the main ingredient by weight."
8432;Disappointed with Amazon's policy;Price dropped by $5 in matter of 2 days.  Item didn't even arrive but Amazon refused to price match.
8433;Delicious 'healthy' treat;"This is certainly one of the most decadent ""low fat/good for you"" brownies made. I'm still not convinced this product has any nutritional benefit, but it is a great alternative to regular brownies."
8434;GREAT;this product makes a differnece in my energy level. ive been using for at least 3 months.
8435;3 out of 5 liked it;The 2 cats that didn't like it are older and I think it is because the smaller round shape is harder to hold in their mouths to chew as a piece would drop out of their mouth and they wouldn't try to retrieve it. The other 3 eat it fine without hesitation.
8436;KIND PLUS Dark Chocolate Cherry Cashew Bars;This review is for the DARK CHOCOLATE CHERRY CASHEW flavor only..
8437;cookies for kids of all ages;"Your name doesn't have to be David to find a big old grin on your face at the sight of the bright red tin that says ""David's Cookies""! Two delicous pounds of homemade-good cookies. Just enough for one big kid and a gallon of milk."
8438;Dogs enjoy it, but no more than their other bones;We got this Nylabone because of the bacon flavor figuring our dogs would love it. They definitely like the bone and chew on it, but no more than their other bones (beef femur).
8439;Very versatile product...;We have found this product to be very tasty and very versatile.  I saw in a recipe for latkes by Mario Batali that he added some matzo meal to his recipe.
8440;Biscuits;It was alittle comfusing with ordering the best price and using the free shipping. However the gift was received and appeciated, so all came out well.
8441;The cats could not care less;The major reason I wanted to try this product is that we have a strong presence of feral cats, plus raccoons and badgers come out at night as well.  I have a square lot running a little over a quarter acre.
8442;Favorite Dark Roast;A great  dark roast coffee, my husband and I tried many different dark roast coffees and found that we always came back to  Green Mountain Dark Magic.  It has a full bodied rich flavor.
8443;This product is Great;This product is great it really works. I have lost a total of 15 pounds in two months wihout exercising.
8444;Good cup of coffee;I use a one cup coffee maker and used to use Senseo pods which I found at the grocery store but then the stores stopped carrying them so I turned to Amazon and tried these and I like them even better than the Senseo..
8445;Husband LOVES Post Bran Flakes from Amazon!;When Publix in South Florida stopped selling Post Bran Flakes we were at a loss..
8446;Twinings English Breakfast black tea;Twinings never disappoints. Of all the higher end black teas, I prefer Twinings and Tazo.
8447;Best tasting;This has been the best tasting Stevia I have tried.  I also think this is a better value than some of the others.
8448;PB2 great!;For a dry product that you add water to, it is amazing that it tastes so delicious.  Other than being pricey, it is great and I really like it's nutritional benefits.
8449;Natural, Mild, Subtle Chamomile Tea;****<br />Stash's Chamomile Caffeine Free Herbal Tea is one of their totally natural teas, containing only chamomile flowers--that's all! Although I do like this, it means that the tea is rather weak, but still a fine tea---just use two teabags. Many people will find this tea too subtle.
8450;"Medium ""so so"" grade white tea - good for iced tea preparation";I bought this tea because I love white tea.  Normally I buy loose tea, and of the highest grade.
8451;some good, some not...;some of these survived shipping ok.  some were 90% pulverized dust by the time they got to my home.
8452;Im in Love!;I received a free sample of 5-Hour ENERGY® from Smiley360 and it changed me. I was so impressed with how much of a boost it gave me without making me nervous or having racing heartbeat.
8453;Good as Always;I love this coffee.  When the supermarket where I frequent wasn't carrying the french vanilla latte, I went on line to purchase it.
8454;Worked on first day!;I read the reviews.  I wanted a solution that did not use poison due to our pets.
8455;Great tasting popcorn!;Popped this popcorn in our Stir Crazy popcorn popper, and it was delicious. Popped 4 bags to share with friends around campfire and everyone loved it.
8456;Every bit helps!;My milk production was almost down to nothing and this gave me the boost I needed to get it up again. Tastes great and the way it's packaged is perfect for a fresh taste.
8457;A Good Tasting Wine;Barberesco comes from ther same grape as Barolo but isn't as full bodied. I think this wine is slightly on the thin side but tastes very good.
8458;NOT worth the money;you would expect soething worth the $20, but instead I got a cheap jar that has 50 cents worth of candy and had to pay $8 for shipping, that was a rip off. A jar of Tylanol the same size is less than half of what I paid for this cheap product, I've never been so disappointed.
8459;A third was Decaf Coffee;I understand that some of the coffee in assortment sampler packs with be decaf but a third of the pack was. I would not have bought it if I knew so much Decaf would come with it.
8460;It's water, with a metallic aftertaste.;Essentia 9.5ph Drinking water is pretty much.
8461;I Thought It Was Just Me;I was dying to try Ritter Sport Dark Chocolate with Marzipan, so I bought the case!  I love chocolate, almonds, and marzipan.<br /><br />I did wonder how there would be enough filling to taste the marzipan without it oozing out.
8462;Reliable product;I have purchased NectaSweet twice from Amazon
8463;Something good to talk about.;The usual high quality product we've grown used to over the years. Still has the quality and the taste.
8464;Expresso;This coffee was great..
8465;Fantastic!;After a Bariatric Surgery, I can't take pills whole. I must crush them and mix them with the sugar-free apple sauce.
8466;Extremely bland and not remotely the flavor of Pad Thai;I liked Dr. McDougall's split pea soup and his oatmeal, so I decided to try this.
8467;More like dishwater than tea;This is such a weak tasting tea, that it is barely better than drinking hot water.  Even using two tea bags per cup, it is deficient.
8468;"Very good taste, but contains high ""maltose"" corn syrup!";A friend brought these to a party, and we all LOVED them.  They taste fantastic.
8469;Good price, as advertised, fast delivery;Good price, as advertised, and fast delivery.  Recommended and will repeat future purchases with this seller.
8470;Really good;This KIND healthy grains vanilla blueberry clusters with flax seeds granola is really good. The blueberry is subtle enough that it doesn't overpower the flavor, and the sugar is sweet, but not overly sweet.
8471;popcorn;the baby white popcorn has lots of hulls when popped, very small kernels and scorched the bottom of my new whirley popper. I've had several poppers and this is the first time one has scorched and the first time I've used the Wabash corn.
8472;Bigelow is the best!!;As a very picky person. I prefer this blend of Bigelow's to all others.
8473;Disappointed in flavor this year.;I bought this product last year, and it was great. I anxiously awaited the release of it this season, and when I got it, was very disappointed by how weak it is.
8474;Sooo GOOOOOOD;I bought these because I like meat snacks and Slim Jims are just way to greasy. I can't wait to purchase the next box.
8475;Maybe I'm being unfair because of my dark roast bias, but...;..
8476;Delicious;This is one of the only healthy foods that I'll never have to be coerced to eat!<br /><br />This might be weird but it makes a really great topping for frozen yogurt for a quick snack.  I actually just mix in around half a cup of cereal and 1 cup of lowfat frozen yogurt (I've only tried with vanilla so far)<br /><br />I've also tried it with almond milk for breakfast and it's pretty good as well.
8477;Nutritious Snack on the Go!;I always worry my 2-year old doesn't get enough veggies.  He loves these pouches which are easy to pack in his bag for lunch at daycare.
8478;Great Dog Food for Dog With Limited Tolerance for Foods;My dog can only have lamb. He gets sick with any other meat:chicken, beef, turkey, bison, duck,fish.
8479;best protein cereal;This is one of very few cereals with protein so that I am not hungry all morning.  It tastes good too!  I mix it with another cereal to cut down the calories.
8480;Bonsai Tree;My younger son actually bought this for himself!  He had an Amazon.com gift certificate and bought it with that.
8481;Best crunchy granola bar!;I have been trying to eat better. And I have been going on photo walks.
8482;Dogs can't digest Pork..., or Turkey!;"Gave my dog ""Severe"" diarrhea, and cost me a Big vet bill to find that Pork/Turkey.."
8483;Heaven in a bag;I have bought these from QVC and my family just loves them!  They are wonderful
8484;I'm not a big tea drinker, but this tea is exceptional !;I went to the Paris Baguette bakery in downtown Palo Alto the other day and got a pastry and did not want to drink a coffee drink so I ended up ordering some tea.  There were many kinds, so I just said green please, then they gave me a further list of the green teas, so I just said surprise me!<br /><br />They did, they gave me a big cup of this tea that was really smooth and fresh and very nice and warm and just the right touch of mint refreshing .
8485;A saving grace for Green Mountain Coffee...;When we received our Keurig Elite for Christmas, we were so excited to break open the sample pack of pods to try out different blends and flavors.  Of the 12 pods we had in the box, four were Green Mountain Coffee brand.
8486;Great product!!!!!!!;This product is not only great tasting but very soothing effect on the stomach..
8487;New Taste;This is one of the better teas that I have tried.  And it is good for you.
8488;Perfectly Delicious;I have been buying Kind Bars for over a year and must say each and every bar is wonderful. I use them as a snack or a breakfast and find it keeps me satisfied completely.
8489;Very tasty sour apple taste, good for mixing ...;I was happy to see this at Amazon-- it was at my local grocer, but only in July! It is a nice flavor, and I have been known to..
8490;the best cookie ever;I had Tim Tams while traveling in Australia & New Zealand this summer.  This is the best cookie you will ever eat.
8491;Mmm!;I had this at a cafe and loved it so came to Amazon to find it. Completely satisfies chocolate cravings!  It's like drinking brownie batter so i tend to use a little more milk.
8492;decaf;Read the fine print, I apparently did not..
8493;liking it more and more;------- Ok, its been a few months since I bought this, and I find that the taste is really growing on me.  I don't normally get into the herbal teas.
8494;Chewy and Satisfying;Whole grain ingredients and good tasting.  Most Kashi products have mostly white flour with very little whole grains, but these cookies are primarily a whole grain mix.
8495;Arguably but not defintively Better than Greenies;My dog loves these. The doggie store suggested to me that these were more effective than greenies in cleaning teeth but who knows.
8496;not exactly buttery;Love the idea of a low calorie popcorn as a snack while on a diet. But this one is pretty flavourless.
8497;Great Harissa powder;I usually but Harissa as a paste but my refrigerator tends to get overly full so I thought I would give powdered harissa a try. Very satisfactory taste, no bitterness, and adds a rich intensity to my dishes.
8498;Delicious and Nutritious;It's hard trying to get the other members of my family to eat healthy, so I was glad to find this Orzo.  While most whole grain pastas are hard and grainy, this has a smooth texture and is very tasty.
8499;great corn... especially for small corn lovers;small kernels lead to small popcorn..
8500;Good coffee but Walmart is cheaper now.;Just after ordering this coffee at $14.03 per 28-count, our local Wal-Mart stocked the shelves with the exact thing for $5.
8501;Absolutely amazing!;I tried these when I was in Italy. I loved them so much I purchased all of them that I could find from the airport.
8502;Organic Brown Sugar;This is a wonderful brown sugar.  Stays moist and great used as a sweetner or used in baking.
8503;Great tea for the price;After reading other reviews, I decided to give this tea ([..
8504;matcha;Exellent product. Matcha Source has some issues though.
8505;Still too expensive.........;Hello<br /><br />On sale for 62 cents a bag.  Not cheap enough for me.
8506;Normal Coffee with a Kahlua Sticker;The only thing this coffee has related to Kahlua is the logo. I didn't expect alcohol, but I did expect some cream and sweetness included at the very least with anything branded Kahlua or Bailey's.
8507;A great, grain-free choice.;"I recently adopted two kittens after the death of my 16 year old cat from kidney failure. Like many cat owners, I knew nothing about cat nutrition, and I assumed if I bought food from my vet, or if I stayed away from the ""bottom shelf"" brands at the grocery store, I was doing well by my cat."
8508;"Robertsons ""Silver Shred"" marmalade";It doesn't get any better than this one if you like English style citrus marmalades.  All Robertsons are good and this one rivals or tops Rose's even.
8509;Tastes like coffee candy;If you've ever had one of those coffee-flavored hard candies (like coffee nips), that's exactly what this coffee tastes like, only in liquid form. It's a nice flavor, but it does not remind me of cappuccino.
8510;Best Ever Biscuit Mix!;My husband never cared much for my homemade biscuits. I didn't make them often enough to really get it right like my mother and grandmother used to do.
8511;Love it!!!;I have been looking for this item since last winter. My store stopped carrying it (and I shop at four different grocery stores)I'm so glad I found it here.
8512;Might just be the best chai EVER;So I basically always choose Oregon Chai and it was good. Then I found Oregon Chai instant which for some reason was WAY better than the concentrate versions (no sour aftertaste I got from the others).
8513;Perfect protein snack;These protein bars are a perfectly healthy treat.  I love that I don't have to feel guilty when I grab one of these.
8514;Elderberry Jam at its Best;This Elderberry Jam met all my expectations. I can highly recommend it to anyone looking for quality Elderberry Preserves.
8515;Sugary, but great for the price.;Satisfyingly crunchy cereal. Bit too sweet (and that is apart from the raisins, leaves the milk sweet as well).
8516;good syrups;These syrups are great for slushes. My kids love them and they are great for summer parties.
8517;Coffee's delicious, but not the easiest to brew.;Fantastic coffee.  Here's my trouble -- and it's very likely that it is MY trouble alone: I don't know how to make a cup of good, strong coffee using these tea-bag sort of coffee packets and a regular coffee machine.
8518;GREAT CHILI SAUCE!;Heinz Chili Sauce 12 oz. (Pack of 12) This is a Great Chili Sauce, I call it Premium because it is made with great tasting tomatoes, onions, garlic, sweet peppers, spices and a hint of vinegar I love using it when I make Chili Dishes and specially with my Barbecue Sauce I never had it with Burger and Fries as the bottle suggests, I should try that, I don't always find it where I live and shop, so it's great to be able to get it here, you don't have to drive all over wasting Gas, it comes straight to your front door, how good is that? .
8519;Excellent Quality at GREAT Price;I have tried quite a few different brands of Extra Virgin Expeller Pressed Coconut Oil and this has got to be one of the best.  I use it for everything.
8520;old favorite;A great breakfast on the run. Cinnamon is good for you and these without the frosting aren't too sweet.
8521;Nonni's is my favorite;I am a real biscotti fan.  I have ordered several Nonnie's flavors.
8522;Best Molasses Out There;This is one of the best and natural tasting molasses I have came across. It is sweet, cake batter like consistency and dark brown.
8523;No Bull: This stuff rocks;Ah Red Bull, equally fantastic as an energy drink or as a 'mixer' for 'adult beverages,' as my Grandmother used to call them. What can I say that you don't already know? Weather you're looking for an shot of energy or something tasty to blend with vodka and a fresh lime, Red Bull will not disappoint.
8524;Lipton is the Best!!!!!!!!!!!;Lipton has been my tea of choice for many years.  I drink it English style, with milk & sugar.
8525;Doesn't do its job;It doesn't really clean up the smell from my dogs' mouths. They love Greenies so much because Greenies got by-products in the ingredients which taste really good but doesn't do good job for the breath.
8526;Delicious in your coffee.;I like the taste of Hazelnut Delight Liquid Creamer. I put it into my coffee and love the delicious taste.
8527;Some like it hot;I love these very gingery candies, sweet with a spicy kick.  I used to find them at Trader Joes and Target - but recently they have dissappeared.
8528;Buy for the content, not the container;After going through several iterations of trying and ending subscriptions to different Amazon coffees, I've finally arrived at home on Camano Island.<br /><br />The taste of their Organic Sumatra Dark Roast is deep and balanced.
8529;Weak - get Emeril's Big Easy Bold!;On the middle or 'mug' setting of the Keurig B-70, Donut House didn't hold a candle to Emeril's Big Easy Bold k-cup.  Emeril's is superior - truly robust, full and velvety without any hint of a burned, smokey or earthy taste whatsoever, but has a terrific depth and complexity.
8530;Terrible;I should have known when I saw corn syrup as the first ingredient.  This is glorified jelly.
8531;Best oatmeal ever;I love this oatmeal, and eat it daily with hot pure maple syrup and whole milk.  I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars because if one cooks it according to instructions, it cooks to the pan.
8532;My dogs Love these...;My dogs Love these..
8533;You are only getting one container!;I purchased 2 other types of Blue Diamond almonds on the same day, and they were both around $11 for a pack of 3. T his one was only ONE 8 oz.
8534;Great Preserves!;Mango Preserves is great! The taste is excellent. You must try making the mango mango cream cheese.
8535;Our Dog Loves Them;"We have been feeding our dog these ""Good for Them"" treats since the line came out.  She loves them."
8536;Please pressure Amazon for your amazing product;I have been baking with this product for two years. It is far and away the BEST product out there -- offering a wonderful texture and flavor.
8537;My New Favorite Snack!;I was looking for a healthier snack when I happened upon the Kind Healthy Grains Dark Chocolate and Cranberry here on Amazon.  Because the reviews were good, I decided to give it a try - but quite honestly I wasn't sure if I'd like it since I don't usually like healthy / whole grain types of things (with the taste and texture of cardboard).
8538;Great for you;Plain or flavored, soy milk is great for you. Try it, particularly with added nutrients, over cereal in the morning, or as a delicious stand-alone cold drink.
8539;Good quality but the dogs are unenthusiastic;This is a good quality product with good size pieces and few crumbs.  However, my dogs are not enthusiastic about it.
8540;some things don't calm down;Needed a sleep aid, The reviews amazed me so I ordered some.  Brought it back with me from the states to Costa Rica.
8541;FANTASTIC BLUEBERRIES;Just bought a bag of these blueberries, and they are absolutely fantastic!  I am not even a big fan of blueberries, but this could change my mind completely.<br /><br />I've already debated taking an entire bag on a 3 day trip- and eating the whole thing.
8542;Quality cat food.;We were looking for an organic food after the melamine poisoning of pet food debacle.  Newman's Own dry foods for cats and dogs are manufactured in the US per their corporate veterinarian.
8543;Poor packaging;We were really looking forward to receiving and trying the oatmeal.  The 4-Pack arrived today.
8544;"Good as long as it's ""good""";My daughter loves to get these at Starbucks whenever we go to get me an overpriced coffee.  I feel good about giving them to her because it's Organic, however, there have been more that a few times that she has gotten a rancid one that had not even yet past the expiration date!  I know these don't have to be refrigerated.
8545;Good, but FAR TOO SWEET!!;I use this to calm my generally overactive system, deal with stress and sleep better, and it's not unpleasant. It's sweetened with Stevia, which I prefer to any other sweetener.
8546;The oatmeal flavor is great for a wheat-restricted kid!;My 3 year-old daughter and I need to avoid wheat-- but are not strictly gluten-free.  We also avoid all artificial sweeteners, corn syrup, etc.
8547;Great Mint from Europe;We first encountered Smints in Spain.  The product has limited distribtuion in the US.
8548;Enjoyed this coffee.;"I wanted ground decaf (Swiss Water Method) which I couldn't find locally except at very expensive prices. I mix it with regular coffee and have ""half-caff."
8549;Very Good!;I've had the other Nana's No Gluten Cookie Bars in Berry Vanilla, and they aren't that good. But, the Chocolate Munch flavor is good.
8550;Starbucks by mail;"I ordered the 50-""dose"" Starbucks VIA coffee from Amazon rather than direct from Starbucks, saving money and getting fast, free  delivery. I like the Italian Roast, and recommend it."
8551;A good choice;This is a good choice for anyone who likes salmon, even if they have never made the leap to salmon roe. It lacks subtlety
8552;great product;Have used the hand soap for a while and decided to give the kitchen soap a try..
8553;Marley One Love Organic Coffee;I have not always been a coffee drinker but have recently begun to enjoy a cup or two per day. Since my son is the only other person her that drinks coffee and he usually drinks the entire pot by himself, I tend to use the store brand or Maxwell House single serve coffee that is used in the same manner as a tea bag.
8554;A nighmare dealing with this company;Folks, move along--don't buy this from these people.  They are completely incompetent.
8555;The Fruit Flavor Vita Coco;This tastes awful! ..
8556;Maxwell House - Good to the Last Drop for sure;Very good coffee - I can get it much cheaper through Amazon than I can locally.  I have signed up to get two 33 oz cans a month.
8557;Look at the ingredients after chicken meal!;I've heard this is a good food, but was shocked to see after chicken meal so many grains. I did not feed this to my dog.
8558;cat food;Well I don't want to give this cat food more than 3 stars<br />because my cat is very picky about what she eats and she did<br />not like this food so I will have to find out what to do with it.<br />I have 22 cans of it.
8559;Best Taste in Town;Better flavor through high quality ingredients. Every cup of tea has the depth of flavor that<br />Makes you want to drink every day.
8560;Good, refreshing water;"The water is great. Tastes crisp and clean with no aftertaste or ""vitamin smell""."
8561;Who came up with this price?;This bag is under $4 at Costco (Oct 2011), perhaps a buck more at any competitive retail outlet.  What idiot at Amazon supports ripping off their cuctomers to this extent?  Shameful.
8562;Exactly what I wanted;The Jimmies had purple in the mix.  That was exactly what I was looking for.
8563;recommended;Excellent quality and value product. Peppers are whole and they freeze well if you won't be using them all at once.
8564;a yummy snack;I have loved Famous Amos cookies for years and this is a great way to take them with me wherever I go.  These are great for when you pack your lunch and also great in that you have a limited portion and won't overeat.
8565;Great Snack !;With a major sweet tooth I am always looking for the next great snack and I have found it in stix in the mud. I first tried Funley's product at a local grocer in Los Angeles.
8566;Not Like I Remember;There were just of few grape, blue & green, there were a TON of red, my least favorite.  The packaging is cheesy, the sucker is smaller and several were broken.
8567;Highly Addictive, Strong Peach Flavor, Store Well;I've had my love affairs with Haribo candies on and off for years now.<br /><br />The peach flavor is probably my favorite.
8568;Finally No Artificial Sweetener!!!;"I have been on the look out for an ""on the go"" water flavor mix, and found this at my local Smith's! There were only two other flavors, so I got the kiwi strawberry, as I don't like grape and the lemon-lime was sold out.<br /><br />There is no after taste, and I can actually use the whole packet without it tasting too sweet or funny."
8569;Perfect chew bone;My little beagle loves to chew.  I bought the Nylabone at her vet's suggestion.
8570;Different than from Petfood Express in San Francisco;I was originally purchasing this at Petfood Express in San Francisco. Then I saw it was cheaper at Amazon and started buying from there.
8571;Great for Call Center Work;I work for a call center and talk all day long.  The air is dry in my area and the best relief I have found was from the Throat Comfort tea.
8572;Maybe too awesome;These are great, and I love the bulk purchase with Amazon. Worst danger is that you want to eat more than you should because they are really very good.
8573;Sucralose!;I really, really dislike Sucralose.  I don't like the taste, the aftertaste, or the after effects.
8574;good price;Purchased these on sale around superbowl time when we go through lots of dips.  Normally buy locally, but the town was sold out and we try to be as organic as possible.
8575;Still a good health choice, but blech!;I had been purchasing loose leaves from another company, but one day when they weren't available, I ordered these bags.  Blech!!  The loose leaves from Immortalitea were such a pleasant tasting product.
8576;Too Salty;More Salt Than seeds .I washed  and then roasted them,did not worked .
8577;Calebaut chocolate callets (drops);Calebaut is premium Belgian chocolate.  The callets are a convenient size for melting for truffles.
8578;"I've finally found ""my"" bar";I've been some combination of nursing and/or pregnant for a few years now, and trying to find time for a meal when chasing after a toddler or when morning sickness gives you many reasons to avoid every food on earth can be a real challenge. Because of this I sometimes feel like my pantry is some sort of test cabinet for a nutritional bar company.
8579;LOL - at myself;"I knew nothing about Manuka honey but wanted to see what it would do about a burn on my hand so I bought a jar from Whole Foods that had no name on the label but on the side it said ""packed by Arataki for Pacific Resources International."" It did improve my burn very much and I was sold! So I read up about Manuka honey and went and bought Wedderspoon 16+."
8580;Awesome;These Pop Chips are incredible. They taste so much better than baked chips and the quantity you get for 2 points is so much more.
8581;poor quality;The packaging was intact and all but when I opened the box I found that the greenies were stuck together and wouldn't break apart (even when I tried smashing them against the concrete). At some point they must have been moist that they had become so cemented together.
8582;Third Ingredient SUGAR?;The ingredient list above is incorrect. Ordered this and discovered third ingredient is sugar and the crude protein is listed as 11%.
8583;Great Seeds For Sprouting;Good quality seeds..
8584;PB2 POWDER;FIRST TIME TASTING FOR ME. OPENED THE AIR TIGHT PACKAGE RIGHT UP AND FOLLowED THE DIRECTION.
8585;Nice and strong - the way I like it.;I consider myself somewhat of a coffee expert.  I have tried all types and prices of coffee brewed in every type of container (from french presses to drip makers to keurig and pod devices to cappuccino machines).
8586;Weak, wimpy, worthless;This tea is weak at best when compared to other rose hip teas I have tried. The bags have no string and tag.
8587;New fun treat;My dog loves this treat. She loves the taste of it and I like that it lasts a while.
8588;Our favorite chips;These chips are the whole family's favorite. They are just the right size to share, but not so big that they go stale before they are gone.
8589;Good qualities overshadowed by odd taste;I pitted this against another leading brand of coconut water, but I'm not sure I would order it again. While there were undoubtedly some positive tasting qualities, likely owing to good practices and Thai sourced coconuts, these were considerably overshadowed by a metallic taste.
8590;Inexpensive authentic Indian food;As an Indian food lover, I have tried many Kitchens of India product due to their easy to make instructions and authentic taste. This is not an exception.
8591;A big change;I discovered DeLallo Imported Garlic, Oil and Hot Pepper Sauce in the early 2000s and loved it, using 2-3 jars/week.  My sons both loved it as well.
8592;works for my cat!;We have one cat with both a sensitive stomach and hairball problems. I've tried quite a few treats, and these are one of the few I can give her that don't come back up.
8593;I love Wellness;I only wanted the best for my little nutmeg. So I did some searching online I started out giving her Friskes and then I got Fancy Feast, I read that to give her the best I should try Wellness.
8594;Perfect;Absolutely perfect.  Love this product.
8595;Delicious and Effective;This tea was a lifesaver when I came down with a nasty cold and cough.  Cough suppressants were not working at all, but a good hot cup of this Tea for Colds calmed my coughing for an hour at a time.
8596;Yuk!;This stuff is disgusting! If I could give this 0 stars, I would. I can't even give this stuff away.
8597;Bland, Snickerdoodle, Tastes like flour;I found these to be flavor-free.  They tasted like white flour, the snickerdoodle ones I bought had hardly any cinnamon.
8598;Way to Start the Day!;We have been using several of the Great River products for some time now, and have been impressed by the quality, variety and taste.  We also like that they are organic.
8599;Great coffee for any time of day;It's a smooth blend - none of the extreme (to me, anyway) bitterness in many coffees.  Wakes me up quickly in the morning and relaxes me in the evening.
8600;Good Cereal...could've been better;The cereal is tasty, although, it would've been better if it were actual graham crakers covered in chocolate.  It's more a mixed nugget made to look like graham crackers.
8601;The cats LOVE these;I don't know what these are..
8602;Coconut water crazy!;I was turned onto coconut water through my yoga studio and Vita Coco is the brand they carry. Is slightly sweeter than I had hoped for, but on the other hand, its flavored varieties have a better taste than other flavored brands I've tried.
8603;Disappointing;My puppy is teething so I had previously purchased the original Nylabone made out of flavored plastic. The dog loved it, not super excited about the regular bone but she did put a lot of work into destroying it.
8604;K-Cup Holder;Exactly as advertised. Plenty of space to set the Keurig brewer on top and still fit under a counter top (depending on counter top height).
8605;superb olive oil;This Villa Manodori Artigianale Olive oil was given to me by a dinner guest. I had no idea how special it would be! It has a clean but very nutty flavor.
8606;Fenugreek seed for diabetics;My mom takes fenugreek seed daily to control her blood sugar level. It works well and she has been able to reduce her dosage of Glucophage.
8607;Fabulous coffee!;I simply love Keurig coffee, particularly Timothy's French Roast. And the opportunity to buy it at a really great price makes my morning even more fabulous.
8608;My dog goes crazy for these!;My chihuahua loves these, especially the peanut butter, chicken, and bacon varities. They have become increasingly hard to find at pet stores so I was happy to find them on amazon.
8609;I can taste the MSG and onion powder.;Definitely not what I expect from dry roasted almonds. Truth in labeling maybe? Not going to deny that I didn't like the taste, but it's more the point that these are not what dry roasted almonds taste like.
8610;must be good;All of my cats seem to love this food.  This line of Fancy Feast products are the best Purina has made.
8611;delicious!;These are great little snacks, tender and yummy! Will definitely buy them again. Great cranberry flavor, but they do contain a little sugar, so if you are very carb restricted, you might want the ones with no fruit.
8612;Creamy and Mild - if you like that;About what you might expect from Taco Bell sauce. It's middle-of-the-road in terms of spice and texture.
8613;My yorkie loves Merrick Bully Sticks;I gave my yorkie puppy his Merrick Bully Stick and he chewed on it for HOURS, which I love because it freed up some time for me to relax without having my puppy running around destroying everything in my house!<br /><br />Merrick bully sticks are great for puppies and adult dogs.  I have purchased other brand bully sticks and my dog prefers these far more than other brands.
8614;Wisdom of the Ancients Pau d' Arco;This is the only brand I buy for my teas and mixes. I can trust the quality and mfg.
8615;Great product;I have used up a whole box of this panko and have just received the second order.  I like the size of each container and my food with this panko comes out just right after deep-frying.
8616;Good stuff, man;Really high heating point, all the goodness of olive oil, but lighter flavor.  Makes a lovely mayonnaise, salad dressings, etc.
8617;good product--but have they downized the packages?;Ive bought these on a couple other occasions---and I swear they downsized the packages..
8618;UNDERWHELMED;"I saw these on food networks ""Unwrapped"" and couldn't wait to try them, I actually and thankfully signed up for an Amazon CC and got a 30.00 credit."
8619;i like this item a lot but not at this price!;I know other places you can get this less expensively and you don't have to buy in bulk but it still costs a lot. It tastes very refreshing IMO.
8620;Careful - these are addictive!;Crunchy and delicious, I love these little guys. Try with Camembert or brie.
8621;Disgusting;I was very excited to find this product, having really enjoyed Newman's Own products in the past and coming to trust them.  I am also a firm believer in feeding the best grain free diet to my Labs, and 95% organic beef went well with that.
8622;ridiculous price;ok, I admit, I do buy a lot of stuff on Amazon, usually because of great price and quick shipment..
8623;Our finicky eater's favorite food;This flavor of Fancy Feast is decidedly the favorite of our waif of a cat.  She is usually a very picky eater, but this trout flavor really gets her excited.
8624;Alright;Nice company, will answer your emails.<br />This fish is ok.
8625;A great product, you must try!;I study plants and I am into alternative healing.  I learned about Mullein a number of years ago and found that it's very useful for sinus, cold and flu issues.
8626;Doesn't taste like Decaf;Newman's Special Decaf is one of my favorite decaf coffees for drinking in the evening. The flavor is rich and can fool many into thinking they're drinking caffeinated coffee.
8627;holy cheapness!;I know the price varies for stage 1 foods but sometimes they are a lot cheaper on amazon then in the stores. I wasn't sure how many were in the package so I decided to just buy one.
8628;Tried and True;Looking for quick snack. Picked up this brownie mix at Walmart to test it.
8629;Delightful wholegrain cereal;This is a really pleasant granola  with a lower fat content, lightly sweetened, and with chewy dried blueberries. Delightful.
8630;WOW beyond impressed;i have bought hundreds of items from amazon and never bother to leave a review..
8631;excellent;I've always found this to be the best major brand pasta in quality/taste/texture. My local stores stopped selling it so I'm glad to get it from Amazon.
8632;The skinny one;The ABC book and foodstore nearby temporarily closed but My Dear AMAZON has always been prompt and reliable w/ my orders.THANK YOU ,AMAZON.
8633;Excellent Roast;This coffee is the best I've tried yet.  It is a dark, strong, full-bodied coffee without being bitter.
8634;Delicious for the Dog;I must say that my dog and all at the dog park LOVE these treats. Even the very fussy boxer sniffs at my pocket waiting for them.
8635;leaking packaging;I was disappointed in the condtion in which these arrived.  Over 1/4 of the box had leaking tubs.
8636;Love it!;I love ginger
8637;cherry juice;This Indian Summer Montmorency Cherry juice is a great sour cherry juice I like it better than the others. Sams Club sells it to for about the same price.
8638;Czar Nicolas II Tea;I truly love this tea. Bought it once from a Russian deli store and I am addicted! Black loose leaf tea + real rose petals + safflower.
8639;If You Are Wondering???;Unlike the other hot chocolate(s), this one does not have that obnoxious after taste.  What a relief.
8640;Really Improves Teeth!;At my dog's 8 year vet visit, they told me to start brushing her teeth.  The vet said that my dog might even need to have a professional teeth cleaning sometime in the next year or so.
8641;Surprisingly Good! Don't Let Emeril's Name Keep you from this Coffee;I was skeptical to buy this coffee for no other reason than it had Emeril's name on it and he has nothing to do with coffee. However, I was pleasantly surprised for the flavor of this coffee.
8642;Fair taste, questionable energy benefits;While tastes may differ, both my girlfriend and I found the taste of this acai-pomegranate energy drink to be uninspired and neither of us felt particularly energized after drinking it, so try it and see for yourself. It looks like those sugar-free packets but actually this does have some carbs, so it is not to be used as a diet drink.
8643;Miracle Noodles;"come on people. Are u expecting it to be the same as eating regular pasta?? If you want the ""real"" thing, eat the real thing."
8644;I LOVE ZICO!;I've been very happy with the ZICO 11oz Tetra Pak from Thailand and decided to give the bottles a try. While it contains a blend of coconuts, I found the taste to be great and the bottle very convenient to use/carry.
8645;Good tea, very gingery;This tea has a wonderfully strong ginger flavor.  The bags come individually wrapped in foil packets.
8646;Good stuff!;It took me a few times to figure out the consistency I like but after that it was all golden. I will keep buying this product.
8647;Kellogg's Raisin Bran;I now prefer this product to its boxed form.  It is portion-controlled, and can be consumed in the bowl provided (i.
8648;Good quality;The beans came well packaged and in time. We have never had a problem with these beans.
8649;nkmat;The 2 pack/20oz Chef Paul seasoning is really a lot so I gave one to my sister. You should intend to use it as a meat rub and let it marinate your steaks for 24 hours but I usually have some at the table too because it will come off during BBQing.
8650;Best of a bad situation;Should preface this by saying that I find tart cherry juice fairly revolting in general, but it's a necessary evil for me as it's one of the few things that REALLY helps my gout. I bought this juice to both help my flare ups as well as help me MAINTAIN a healthy diet which will prevent future flare ups.
8651;Truvia is the BEST sugar substitute;I've always liked Splenda. And I've tried all the other substitutes.
8652;Pumpkin Spice K-cup;Actually ordered these K-cups for my daughter who likes them. I kept a couple of them to try and although I'm not big on flavored coffee, I kind of like this taste once in awhile.
8653;Tastes great as a smoothie;This is a great tasting Matcha.  I too was trying to recreate the Jamba green tea smoothie.
8654;Awesome!;This is a great product. My 2 year old Golden Retriever hates to have his teeth brushed and this product made his teeth white again.
8655;A RIP OFF! 1 Star for Amazon, 5 Stars for the Product;First off it's false advertising for Amazon to say you are saving 92%. This is simply 8 Gerber Grabbers, like you would buy in the store.
8656;Great!;These are great! Just like the other reviewer said, you honeslty can't tell the difference between these and regular pretzels. And they're healthier for you becuase they're made with whole grains instead of enriched flours.
8657;You have to be kidding me...;Why the hell would you pay this much when a grocery store is within a few miles from home, costing much less. Someone please explain.
8658;The Matcha is Mine...;And the sailor said 'Brandy, you're a fine girl, what a good wife you would be..
8659;Best popcorn;I love popcorn and want it ready to eat. This stuff is super fresh and every time I share it with a friend they rave about it and I send them home with a whole bag.
8660;Tasty but only 10 calories less than a Payday candy Bar & will melt in summer heat;I really enjoyed the taste of these bars but it's probably because I love Payday candy bars.  I compared the caloric intake and was surprised to find that your normal 1.
8661;It is what it is;If you like thai iced tea from your local thai joint this is most likely what your getting.  Its easily available, relatively cheap and mild so it appeals to more people.
8662;I love this tea!;I have been using Stash teas for years but this is the first organic tea I have tried. The only thing that I can say that is different, other than the fantastic pure taste, is that it takes a little longer to brew it.
8663;Gluten Free Flour - wonderful!;Excellent service. Speedy delivery and perfectly as advertised.
8664;Delicious, Healthy and Natural;This drink is one of its kind, to blend coconut water and coffee is pure genius. The drink is a true experience yes there are a lot of ready to drink cold coffee drinks but only one with coconut water and all natural organic.
8665;Get Naked  Sticks Joint health;Great Product~ First found it at pet store and dog loves them. Vet says they are great for teeth and gut.
8666;best ever;this is my favorite i don't know why anyone wouldn't like this bar it really taste like a raspberry cheesecake i can't believe its only net 14 carbs. i can't stop eating after 1 bar.
8667;The Best Cake Ever!;I make this cake for all the winter holidays.  I bake this in a jelly roll pan.
8668;Smaller Than Expected;"Thought these were the larger sized ones you see in stores but I was mistaken.  These pops are about 7"" inches long and a little less than 1"" inch wide."
8669;"My ""Holy Grail"", the best quality chicken stock on the market";This chicken stock is as good as what I make on my own but so much more convenient. If I do not have enough of my homemade on hand I augment with this.
8670;Love this stuff!;I'm no meat-head but I enjoy a good protein shake after I workout.  I usually jump from ON or whatever Costco has to save on costs but I've decided this is in the best interest of my health and spare no costs.
8671;YUMMY;After searching several stores and websites, I finally found them here.  They arrived fast and FRESH.
8672;Favorite Dark Roast;A great  dark roast coffee, my husband and I tried many different dark roast coffees and found that we always came back to  Green Mountain Dark Magic.  It has a full bodied rich flavor.
8673;Tully's Rocks My Mornings;I don't know what we did wrong here in NY that we got Starbucks, and Seattle kept Tully's.  This is the best coffee I have ever had!  It doesn't matter which type of coffee you choose (although I am partial to both the Kona and the House Blend), they are all great.
8674;Typically Starbuck's;I am by no stretch a coffee expert, but I drink around 4-5 cups a day and thoroughly enjoyed this brew.  It's ground very fine and has a full flavor.
8675;My Favorite;I can't drink caffeine or coffee of any kind.  Thus, I am constantly in search of an alternative to morning coffee.
8676;horrid;"I tried to ""cook"" 6 different bags of these.  Only a fraction of product ""popped up""."
8677;O. M. G. These ROCK!;I read a reference to these on Jillian Michaels's website, checked out the Popchips web page, and liked everything I read. But the proof is in the tasting, of course.
8678;Good, but a touch too sweet (what?! yes!);"Shame on me for thinking all ""Yogurt Raisins"" were made alike!  These are really, really sweet.  Even this sweet tooth can't eat more than a small handful at a time."
8679;Twin Boys love it;Our twin boys have been eating this for breakfast from day one of solids(now 22mos old).  We usually blend up some fresh fruit, a little whole milk, and this oatmeal for breakfast.
8680;Great product;This is a great canned chili.  It's a little pricier than standard canned chili, but I think it's worth it from a taste and quality standpoint.
8681;Awesome;If you like dark chocolate with nuts you should like this.<br />It has a light sweet taste as there is no chemical sugar taste.
8682;Yum!;"I always enjoyed the cinnamon chip scones at Starbucks but since they have gone ""no transfats"" I think all their scones taste odd. I never had them very often but once and a while, I still want a cinnamon scone."
8683;Wellness Core;I have 2 dogs, ages 5 and 10, and we have tried numerous foods. My dogs had been on Blue Buffalo and my vet recently told me to switch because he had read some negative things about it.
8684;Our Favorite!;This coffee is dark, rich yet not bitter. Found it in our room in NO and have been ordering it from Community ever since.
8685;Best Soup Mix ever;I became a fan of the Cheddar Broccoli and the Cheddar Potato when my local Super Target carried Bear Creek brand. They stopped and I Missed this soup so much.
8686;PET FOOD RECALL;Please be aware that this is involved in a recall of pet food manufactured by Diamond. I just ordered this and got a bag that has a production number that is involved in the recall.
8687;Vegetable Broth;This is one of the best broth bases I have ever come accross.  The product is a little more expensive than most but well worth it.
8688;Great product to have in your cupboard and a good price;"Update:  Please note per my information below: product description and photo are no longer accurate.  The product has a sealed lid, not a ""pop-top lid"" and the amount of protein and sodium have changed."
8689;Mmmmmm.....smooth....;I'm not a HUGE coffee drinker but I do like to keep some in the house so that once in a blue moon we can enjoy a cup or have some when friends or family visits.  Being that I'm not accustomed to drinking coffee, I'm VERY, VERY sensitive taste wise to coffees that are really bitter, have a strong, overpowering flavor and ESPECIALLY those who leave a nasty aftertaste in the mouth.
8690;A must for my Pregnancies!;I have drank this tea for both of my previous pregnancies (as suggested by my first midwife) and definitely plan on getting for our current pregnancy. I drink about three cups a day then the last month, I start to drink a lot of straight Raspberry Leaf.
8691;"""This Tea should get the Nobel Peace Prize""";This is a very good tea as far as teabags go..
8692;high price, small bag;This is my fault for not reading/measuring correctly, but based on the price of this bag - $7.99, I assumed that this bag would be substantially larger, at least double if not triple, the size that my walgreens is carrying for 2.
8693;Good food for 9 month old;My daughter loves Earth Best jar food. She is very picky about the taste so their varity comes in very handy.
8694;hmmm;Taste bad. That bad flavor doesn't last.
8695;tastes like movie theater popcorn, just a bit too salty;Overall great product. I tend to only pour in half the salt though because using the full pouch makes the popcorn extremely salty.
8696;Best Mint Tea I Have Ever Had;This is my 'go to' tea out of all the tea brands and flavors I have tried. I average two of these tea bags at my office every day.
8697;sticky and smelly !;First of all I find that the perfume on this balm to be a bit too much.  So much that it becomes noticeable to someone near you.
8698;Delicious tea!;I haven't tried hibiscus tea before, so I can't compare it across the board, but this stuff is delicious.<br />Whole flowers, and when steeped it creates a sour, floral, really rich tea that's very drinkable.
8699;A mess delivered and not what promised;This was a present for my Mom for Christmas.  Although we were at first happy because it showed up before Christmas when it said that it would be after, we were very disappointed on what was delivered.
8700;satisfied customer;This was exactly what I was looking for.  I recieved it in good time and shape.
8701;Great combination healthy, gluten free and yummy!;These have become a family favorite and always have them on hand. No one even knows they are healthy and gluten free except me, they are so good and low in sugar too.
8702;Great item to pack for a long haul trip;I travel a lot to places that lack healthy eating options. This is a wonderful companion to take with me.
8703;fine taste...;A subtle hint of vanilla, not over-bearing adds to the fine taste of this coffee. I am not a big fan of Starbucks coffee, mochas are a different story.
8704;For my hardcore strong & bold black coffee drinker - this is his favorite!!!!;My husband likes his coffee strong, bold, smooth and black.  We've had had Keurig coffee brewing machines for the last three years, and have tried many, many bold coffees.
8705;Mmmmm... Blackening Made Easy;Great on fish fillets, chicken, grilled meats, corn, veggies, popcorn..
8706;very good;This item was a gift and they sent the invoice paid to them.  Gifts should NOT get this information.
8707;Package and shipping issue;I rarely leave negative feedback, but I was shocked by how this product was packaged.  I understand that it is dog food, but a little more time and thought could have gone a long way and not have caused me the pain of what I experienced when the box was opened.
8708;fun for him... not for me!;"my 14 week old puppy LOVES the buster cube. I ordered the large one and had NO problem with the instructions and also found the ""difficult setting"" too easy for my shepherd/jindo mix."
8709;Sweet and hot;Best Jerky around as far as flavor..
8710;Surprisingly good!;I have to start with the fact that I was extremely skeptical on a chocolate coconut water.  I expected a watered down chocolate milk taste.
8711;Very Good Tea;I love this tea, and most stash teas.  This flavor I really enjoy iced and have only made 3 bags hot out of my 100 pack, which is now gone.
8712;best treats for training;these treats are the best we've found for training our rescue dog the basic commands.  they are small, so easy to reward w/out overfeeding and the dog just loves them.
8713;Dandy Candy;I generally buy these candies at big Lots for about a buck a bag. Unfortunately they don't always have them in sugarless nor do they always have the kinds I like.
8714;Awesome herbal tea;I found this herbal tea when visiting in Western Michigan. After I made my first pitcher of iced tea with it I was totally hooked.
8715;My fat cats love it;My 2 fat cats can not get enough of this canned food. They eat it like it is going out of style.
8716;These things are the best in between snack;Okay I was given one of these at a hotel during a conference. I love these things.
8717;Unbelievable Success;Our 22 months old actually spotted this product in a store by herself. Being a picky eater she ate 4 of these immediately.
8718;Cheaper at Costco!;Cheaper at Costco.  So yummy.
8719;It's Wheatena or nothing!;I've been eating this cereal for at least 35 years.  It is so hearty and nutty tasting that all other cooked cereals taste like nothing but cardboard.
8720;Smell & taste too grassy.;I bought this tea based on Amazon's reviews and because sencha tea supposed to help lowering your cholesterol.  Drinking this first cup, I'm very sure I don't like it.
8721;It didn't taste like cider at all;This cider was horrible.  It had a fermented smell to it when it was brewing and didn't taste any better when I actually tried it.
8722;Living Moss - Looks Dead;The moss I received was nothing like the picture.  When I received it in fact it looked brown and overly wet.
8723;Very Healthy for a Breakfast Cereal;First ingredient is Bran which will tell you a lot about what to expect from this product. That is why it has so much fiber that will help keep you fuller longer.
8724;The bags were damaged with holes and stains.;The chips were great..
8725;FANtastic coconut water!;Most of us are dehydrated & don't even realize it. The effects on our organs, therefore, is usually not seen until there's a major problem, and of course we'd like to eliminate that possibility if we can.
8726;Very good;I grew up in Upstate NY (just south of Montreal and just north of the Adirondacks) There were sugar shacks everywhere and I never tasted Mrs. Butterworth's until I was an adult.
8727;Best Ever;Keep one in your kitchen for cooking & smoothies, one in bathroom for a facial and one in the bedroom for fun with your partner!..
8728;My cat no longer needs insulin because of this food;I have a diabetic cat. My cat started exhibiting symptoms and I went to my vet who started him on insulin.
8729;Cats both hate it...;..
8730;This is no deal;You'd think if you're buying seven 24oz boxes you'd get a good deal.  As it is, I can buy single boxes at the local Wal Mart for about a 1/3 less.
8731;worth it, but not quite deadly;this is quite tasty and the little skull is cute. the fact that it has jolokia in it braces you for some heat that isn't quite there.
8732;Best Pop Chips Ever!;My new favorite!  Lots of spicy crunch that fully satisfies my snack cravings with lower fat.  I'm a general pop chips fan, but this is the best flavor so far.
8733;South African favourite;A South African favourite -- I was so pleased to find this spread available in the US.  Fast delivery.
8734;Sugar Overload!;Nutrition Facts per serving:<br />Serving size - 1 pack (30g)
8735;Awesome;Great tasting salt n vinegar chips. Not available in New Jersey stores so we buy them by the case.
8736;Worth it!;These cherries are absolutely amazing! They make the difference between an ok Old Fashioned or Manhattan, to the best you've ever had. Buy some.
8737;Loved It!;This is by far the best GF sandwich bread I've tried yet, Whole Foods makes a good one as well but for the price GF Pantry is much better.  It actually tasted like white bread.
8738;Sugar Addicts Take Heed;If you are a sugar addict..
8739;K-cups;These k-cups were good. It was the delivery charge that I was upset with.
8740;This is a favorite tea;I like this tea a lot.  I use it for iced tea as well, it adds a light mint tone to it.
8741;Very Sweet;I like this product, it tastes like ripe coconut water. I know it has sugar added but it still tastes good to me.
8742;Cats love it;Thank you. I got this for a cat who is dying of cancer and word back is that he is very happy in his last days.
8743;Great price;I bought this same brand at a local health food store.  For 1 oz.
8744;Oh man!  Good stuff!;I developed my packaged unsweetened green tea habit while on vacation in Maui.  I'd pound down one in the morning and would just feel great.
8745;It's all about convenience--Sometimes that's important!;The whole range of Chef Boyardee/ConAgra microwavable bowls are like a civilian version of the military's MRE's-- Portable, shelf stable, and ready to heat and eat at any time. They taste decent, and will hold you for several hours if you can't get away from the office for lunch, or are stuck at work late at night.
8746;Delicious!;I bought this first because it was so much healthier (less sugar, calories, etc) than my normal grocery store's other kettle corn brand. I keep buying it because it is probably the most delicious popcorn I've ever had.
8747;Favorite chip!;Doritos are my ultimate favorite!  I love putting them in the middle of my turkey sandwich.  It makes it tastes so much better!  Very cheesy, tasty chip.
8748;Smells and Tastes exactly what they say. The flavor is subtle and elegant.;The flavor and smell doesn't so much as hit you over the head, but elicits an emotional response through one's olfactory senses. Brewing the coffee creates the warmth and smell of a donut shop on a cold's winter morning.
8749;Nuts and chocolate, how can you go wrong?;Chocolate and nuts, two things that are great by themselves, but even better together!<br /><br />I love almonds, raw, roasted, spicy, sweet, you name it. So when I had the opportunity to try these I jumped on them.
8750;The best marinade on the market;This stuff adds so much good flavor to anything you barbecue or roast without adding too many calories.<br />I LOVE it on Chicken, vegetables, pork, and beef.
8751;dog snacks;Trevor (Our beagle) thinks it's the best treat ever!!!!!!!!!!!! WE will certainly buy this snack again. It is priced right, as well.
8752;Best K-Cup Iced Tea;I love my Keurig machine, but I live in Texas and iced tea is a necessity for some native Texans.<br /><br />Even if you don't like iced tea cold drinks are usually the preferred drink in Texas what with the highest recorded temperatures and the most consecutive days of 100+ degree weather in a very long time.
8753;Awesome tea!;This was the best tasting tea I've ever had. It had a rich but mild flavor.
8754;Review of Fiber Formula;I have been using this product through my veterinarian's office.  It was becoming difficult to get there just to purchase these so I had to look for another way.
8755;Anyone remember dissecting owl pellets in grade-school?;That was my first impression of these treats out of the bag..
8756;It's like popcorn for Low Carb dieters;I'm on a low carb diet, and it's very difficult to resist temptation when my family has freshly popped popcorn.  Now I have found the solution.
8757;Bitter;Maybe I've prepared it wrong, but I haven't been happy with the taste..
8758;Just Like the Oil my Mama Made;I am from Asian descent and we regularly use coconut oil for everything. My Mother used to make me coconut oil by shredding the meat, hand pressing the liquids, then boil the water out.
8759;Tasty quasi-cocktail;Crystal Light has long provided favourite products of mine, and this is no exception. It is a nice alternative mixer for those of us who need to be careful of carbohydrate consumption.
8760;It even helped ME!;I suffer from idiopathic insomnia, which is basically lifelong insomnia, every night, with no known cause. I've tried EVERY sleep drug - ambien, trazodone, lunesta, etc.
8761;Awesome Crisps!!! Arrived in just 8 days in Texas from England!!!!;These crisps are my favorite.  I ordered these expecting to get them in a month or two, and to my surprise they arrived in just 8 days!!!<br />I immediately ordered 8 more 6 packs, as my entire family wants these crisps.
8762;Love, love, love Zipfizz!;I am not a huge fan of flavored waters or other water enhancers. To me they never have enough flavor.
8763;Great Dairy Alternative;My 15 year old daughter, who has always had to have her daily dose of cow's milk, was so worried when she was told she had to go Dairy Free. She drank this once and never looked back 
8764;Not the best cookies, but AMAZING cake.;The title says it all. For a gluten free mix, the cookies are a bit lacking but the cake that this package makes (with sour cream) is absolutely amazing.
8765;My Cat's Biggest Favorite!;My cat is somewhat picky eater, so I was a bit nervous about ordering a 24 pack of this can food. The delivery came quickly, and I served the can.
8766;Great for suntea and hot;This is nice and mellow on it's own as hot tea.  For suntea I use 6 bags plus 2 bags FooJoy or Fujian jasmin and fresh picked young spearment leaves - brused.
8767;A unique and delicious culinary gift;Flathau's Snap Pack was purchased to see how good these four flavors would compare with each other. Peppermint cookies - no way.
8768;Grab 'em @ Costco;Where a 4-pack of these tasty lentils & such is cheaper. A great flavor and not as pronounced a scent if you're eating at your desk and/or worried about affecting the microwave's essence in the staff cafe.
8769;Favorite treat;The tuna flavor never fails to entice my cats to eat greedily, no matter how often.  Temptations gets a thumbs up as the best treat I've found and it has the meets the full nutritional needs as well.
8770;Weak and lifeless. Worst of the Colombians.;As with most Green Mountain k-cups, this is weak and bland compared to any other k-cup. Highly disappointing.
8771;Allergy-friendly cookies that taste great!;We buy these cookies in bulk to save a little money and so that we always have a stockpile of safe treats for our son who is allergic to eggs, dairy, is gluten and a whole host of other things. He loves them and they are the perfect tool for bribing him to eat all of his dinner and assisting with toilet training.
8772;almonds too hard;Some of the almonds are really hard, shockingly-loud-when-you-bite-down kind of hard. Hope they didn't chip my teeth.
8773;Do not buy from this vender;The tea is really good but the price is way too high.  Yamamotoyama sells this item for $5.
8774;pretty hot;I bought this mainly to burn myself and it does the job. It's not really hot at first, but then the pain builds to the back of the throat and thats where it really feels like your mouth is suffering 3rd degree burns.
8775;My Cats Love It;"The ingredients in this seems to be better then ""Fancy Feast"" which is mostly fat. I have one finicky cat and one who will eat anything."
8776;Cheaper at the store;I have had this three times, gotten a full eight hours each time when I needed it.  They are cheaper at the store, though.
8777;LIKE ROCKS;THESE POTATO FRIES ARE AS HARD AS ROCKS.I KNOW THAT THE SUPERMARKET HAS POTATO FRIES AND THEY ARE SOFT CHEWABLES.
8778;New convert;I saw three cans of this in T.J.
8779;Cramp,Cramp;I used to buy this tea to an African store for $3 dollars and I drank it once a week but there came a time that d pain was just unbearable.The cramps felt like an abortion when wrong.
8780;V8 100% Vegetable Juice  24/ 11.5  oz cans;What a great way to get your veggies. I have learned to love the taste of V8 juice.
8781;Wish They Were in China;I live in China, and I am unable to find anything made by Jack Link's here. I am able to buy different beef jerky products here, but they just don't taste the same.
8782;The Real Thing;If you want to make popcorn at home that taste like what you get at the movies, this is what you need. A tablespoon in the popper and five minutes later you'll think you're at the movies.
8783;Somewhat greasy and mild tasting;"The taste was somewhat greasy.  Hoped for a product better than ""Slim Jims"" but they are not."
8784;"As Anthony Hopkins said in ""84 Charing Cross Road"" (1987) ""Very nice, very tasty""";This critter serves several purposes. First, as my cats will point out if you sit on the box you own it (cat rules).
8785;Primal Jerky;Messy but it does taste like jerky! Definitely worth trying if you need some vegan convenience foods. The texture and the taste were almost too meat-like.
8786;Many options!;I love mixing one serving of this Cocoa Powder with about 4-5 frozen/cold bananas mixed up for after my workouts. Tastes great, and very healthy! Also these are Organic, and the Amazon S&S price is very reasonable.
8787;Great for soup, pilaf and cous-cous;I'm so glad to see this on Amazon!  I first bought this years ago at a Hungarian food stand, but the stand is gone now and I was wondering where to get more.  I add some of this to broth to boost the flavor when I make soups, rice, and cous-cous.
8788;Smooth & East to Drink;I only gave this a 4 instead of a 5 because I prefer a robust and gritty coffee.  This was a light and smooth flavored coffee.
8789;The prefect Vanilla;My husband and I bake a lot and everyone perfers the taste of the items when we use this type of vanilla. It gives a fantastic taste and smell.
8790;Good for holiday candy;Excellent product.  Has a high enough cocoa butter amount so it can be used in candy making for holiday gifts.
8791;Rating for Amazon price, not the coffee;This is our favorite Starbucks flavor.  So the flavor gets 5 stars but the Amazon price of over $27 for 36 ounces is terrible.
8792;My dog feels better!;I've been giving these treats to my dog for roughly 3 weeks now.  He is a Dalmation/Hound mix and has joint issues in his back legs.
8793;Good quality with a quaint, natural taste;I've been eating these chips with my lunch every day for over two years now. I love the taste first of all.
8794;My lab loves it;My 20 month old yellow lab loves this food. I'm 100% positive he'd love any food I fed him, but I feel better feeding him this because of the quality ingredients used.
8795;NOT for the caffeine sensitive!;The taste is okay, but the caffeine was, for me, intolerable. I had a large cup of Kahlua Mocha at around 10 AM.
8796;best ready to drink tea;If you want a tea that tastes great, sip after sip, and do not like sugar or fake sweetener, this is the tea for you. No artificial anything.
8797;This is my dogs Abby and Zoe's favorite Treat;My dogs favorite treat.  They pass up the other treats for the dried beef liver.
8798;Bad Stuff;This tea seemed like a good deal, it turned out not! The tea leaves were a combination of brown, black, and crispy. There was absolutely no green to it at all.
8799;It Was a Gift;I had bought these nutmegs for a friend who said it was hard for her to find whole nutmegs. She did thank me for them but even though I asked her for some feedback to share with Amazon customers I am afraid she did not oblige.
8800;By Far The Best Jack Links!;I love beef jerky, its perfect for work, packs tons of protein, easy to eat and store.  I have to say though the price of the stuff locally is insane, the 3oz bags go for up to 7 bucks a piece.
8801;Best RIce in America;I'm always excited to go to Japan every year because the rice is so much better.  This is the best rice I've found in America and I'm more than happy to pay the premium for this rice.
8802;Delicious for a snack or treat;I should start off by saying I was not instantly a convert to Larabars. I tried a few of the flavors in the regular line (Larabars) and did not prefer them over other snack/meal bars.
8803;Not my favorite;"These are very filling and I suppose they're good for you. They're just to ""heavy"" for my taste."
8804;Organic, Authentic!;I love Kilambee Coffee, there are organic, authentic and tastes absolutely amazing.  The best thing is they offer free sample on their website.
8805;Spend $150 and you still have to pay $2 every month for a new gasket? Ridiculous;I've been using my new Beaba Babycook less than once a day for three months. It started leaking terribly whereby my entire unit would be sitting in a puddle of water after each cooking session -- VERY dangerous given this is an electrical appliance, so I contacted Customer Service.
8806;Good stuff;I tried this coffee on a recommendation by a friend. It is very<br />stout and has a mildly bitter finish.
8807;Great product!;The Ocean Spray on the Go drink mix is low calorie and very economical on Amazon..
8808;it's delightful quick meal!!;It's Korean spaghetti with black sauce.<br /><br />If you cook it right, it's delightful quick meal.
8809;coffee from where ?;I'm sure everyone hears this a lot, but this is the best coffee We've ever tasted, and at a reasonable price. I swear it's so fresh, all the way from Jersey, it's still warm when it gets here to Arizona.
8810;Delicious;I think this gum is very delicious.  The only problem I had with it is it sticks to my crowned tooth.
8811;Great flavor;I love my Kuerig and Amazon.com's selection of K-Cups is fabulous.
8812;Meh;Not that good, and it does have a very very strong taste. I think this would be my last resort coffee.
8813;dogs liked it;I bought this as a novelty, and the dogs all gladly took as much as I'd give them. It has a plant/gamey smell to it.
8814;"Contains ""Natural Fruit Flavors"", which means? UPDATED";I was going to buy, then checked the ingredients at their website. Natural Fruit Flavors is one of the ingredients, unfortunately.
8815;Great pouch for babies;My 15 month old still enjoys these pouches. He has been eating them for several months now and seem to be his preferred snack.
8816;Molasses sugar;It is what it says - molasses sugar.  To me it tastes more like molasses than brown sugar, which I suppose is a good thing if one happens to like the taste of molasses.
8817;Disappointingly inconsistent with earlier flavours, and quite chemicalish in taste;"When I was growing up in the United States in the mid-1990s, the advent of Altoids from across the Atlantic was a fortuitous time, bringing me and my friends a peppermint that was ""curiously strong"" due to its high concentrate of peppermint oil, naturally flavored, and unlike anything that we had tasted before. After I moved abroad, Altoids became one of the brands I missed most."
8818;Nothing like the crappy stuff I grew up on.;My daughter and I eat low-carb. Which oatmeal is not really, by the way.
8819;The best in peppermint tea;I really enjoy the smoothness of Harney and Sons Organic caffine-free Peppermint Tea.  I use the same tea bag at least twice and sometimes more.
8820;My dog loves these and her hips are better!;I tried these on advice from a friend. I am a believer! They have made my dog's hips better.
8821;Severely overpriced.;I had to drive a bit of a distance to a Chinese market but it was worth it.  The same same amount sold here for nearly $50 is available for about $9 at 99 Ranch Market (Los Angeles).
8822;A subscription to cocoa - Great Idea!!;This cocoa is extremely hard to find and it's my mom's favorite.  I am so excited to be able to subscribe to a monthly delivery for her.
8823;Not so good;It is a very bitter coffee with an after taste. Would not order again.
8824;Excelente para los gatos;Esta golosina gusta mucho a los gatos, en especial los m&iacute
8825;great drink for pumping out..;Great drink for working out. I was paying $5 at 24 hour for each drink now got a case of them for cheap.
8826;Vermicelli, Celiac Disease and recipes, oh my!;Preparation: This was super simple with this product. With Traditional Mai Fun you need to soak it for 10 minutes in very hot water.
8827;Best premade Red Curry simmer sauce;I've tried a lot of the pre-made curry simmer sauces and this is by far the best one I've eaten.  It is very flavorful and has a nice amount of chili heat.
8828;great Dr. Oz recommendation!;Dr. Oz recommended Lingon berries as an excellent super food!  I went on line and only found these berries growing in Sweden and ordered this jam.
8829;orange heaven;i found out about these a few months ago and cry everyday on how much time i missed in eating them. i literally prayed after my first bite that i would get these in heaven.
8830;Great long-lasting chew - even for small dogs!;Though Merrick's website says this treat is for large dogs I totally disagree.  I recently bought one for my 13.
8831;The classic!;Sleepytime is a popular tea that has been around a long time due to its high quality. The natural flavors and ingredients have made it a required tea for the cupboard of persons interested in healthy eating for the last 30 years! The predominant flavors are of chamomile and spearmint--but the additional ingredients--including rose buds--create a satisfying, complex blend that is very tasty and soothing.
8832;Better buy a few extra cans...;My child, in a word, literally inhales these things! They smell & taste great and i would expect them to have a higher sugar content but they're actually a pretty good snack alternative, esp in comparison with fish crackers, cheetos, etc..
8833;This is actually my mostest favorite;This soup is just good.  The broth is spot on and the corn with the other vegetables complement one another very well.
8834;Another great product from Welch's;I think this is my 3/4th review of Welch's 100% juice concentrate products.  Of all the flavors I have reviewed, this was a favorite but not an absolute favorite because it has quite a lot of pineapple juice and I tend to taste this more than the other flavors.
8835;Great Flavorl! Great Price!;I buy this for my husband & also as an occasional treat for my older kids. Since we are a family of 6, the Keurig is not exactly economical.
8836;getting fiber the delicious way;A friend told me about a delicious cereal that is not only low in calories, but full of fiber. I ordered Fiber One cereal about a month ago & not only do I eat a half-cup for breakfast (with fruit) every day, but I have another half-cup before bed.
8837;Search for deep lasting coffee flavor;"Dark and extra bold was the description but it fell short of that. It was dark but didn't have the fully deep and lasting flavor of coffee not just strong, but deep, lasting ""heavy"" flavor."
8838;THE best flavor hands down;Pineapple Kool-Aid is THE best flavor hands down. This flavor is hard to find.
8839;Really gets those juices flowing...;Maybe the definitive Burton film (or maybe more like a tie with `Edward Scissorhands'), `Beetlejuice' is a perfect representation of what Tim Burton is all about.  It is loud and boisterous and at the same time dark and edgy.
8840;Would never know these were gluten-free!;These muffins are so delicious..
8841;Great..  Best pods;For pod espresso, these are the best.  They make a great cup when I dont want to heat up my Ms.
8842;"My cat says ""Yummy""!";My cat gets a bit of this at bedtime, to supplement the CORE in a can.  She really likes it.
8843;what a mess;The hot white chocolate was great.  However, one of the two boxes was complete ruined.
8844;Little dark chocolate bits melt on your tongue. Yum!;There are 3 main styles of granola:<br />1) Hard and crunchy (aka the broken-up granola bar), good for single-hand snacking and on-the-go snacking.  Firm and won't fall apart in your hands.
8845;Wonderful Product & Service;36 Petit Fours for $10.50 is outrageous!! What a super deal!! I had been looking for months for Petit Fours, it was great that Amazon and Swiss Colony could make it happen.
8846;Coconut at its coffee best;Met the high standards of older teens and other adults who don't drink coffee, but will drink this blend if it's availavble. Nice hint of coconut in every sip.
8847;Great salt;I bought this at the same time as the course salt and was very happy with both.  They are as they described.
8848;The product is very good, but the dealer I was buying from is unreliable. Be very careful with which one you are buying from.;The product is very good, but the dealer I was buying from is unreliable. Be very careful with which dealer you are buying from.
8849;Finely ground, no skin, perfect for pastry;I've just received my order and set about making a batch of french meringue macarons (not macaroons..
8850;Great Taste!;I've been searching for a good-tasting protein drink since I had a gastric bypass 3 years ago. I saw this product on another weight loss surgery blog and decided to give it a try.
8851;AWESOME;If you like Latino food and sloppy joes, you'll love this!!  I picked up one reduced pkt at Super Target and flipped!! I can't find it at any stores! Use 2 pkts b/c you'll WANT leftovers!! I served it over rice..
8852;BUYER BEWARE;This product should have more explicit warnings on the packaging. My husband and I bought this as a treat for our 55 lb Doberman/Boxer mix.
8853;Excellent chips, full of flavor and just the right thickness and doneness;I purchased the Salt and Vinegar chips and have been very pleased. There is the right amount of vinegar, virtually every single chip I have tasted is done just right, no burned chips, and they have an excellent thickness to impart just the correct amount of potato taste.
8854;The Worst!;I just finished eating two of these, and I can say that they really are awful. The worst part has to be the coating.
8855;The Goodlife Indoors!;I have three adult indoor cats, and I feed them Goodlife indoor formula in the chicken flavor. I wanted a moderately priced cat food that wouldnt make me go broke, but also wasnt full of ingredients that were unhealthy for my kitties.
8856;Organic and tasty.;I have 12 month olds and no time to write a great review, but they like all the flavors, the textures are great, and the jars open easily. Great on the go snack.
8857;Good product, packaging could be better;We have tried both the apple and greens flavors and my 12 month old son loves both-- has been eating them since 8.5 months.
8858;excellent coffee;I drink coffee everyday, and subscribe to the theory that life is too short to drink bad coffee.  I've taken gambles on coffee in the past and have thrown it away.
8859;Recommend!;I don't cook a lot but I have started keeping a can of this coconut spray in the kitchen since I first tried it. I think since it's coconut it gives something different to any baking I do rather than using a regular oil (or even olive oil).
8860;Delicious tea;This is one my favorite black teas.  It isn't sweet or too spicy like many orange teas, which is why I like it so much.
8861;Greatest candy ever!!!Pennsylvania dutch peanut butter pillows;I remember when my Grandmother used to buy these candies at a church fundraiser.they are the greatest i've ever tasted you should try them also I know you will love them as much as I do!!Pennsylvania dutch peanut butter pillows!!I just re-ordered another because my sister also loves them.
8862;Smells amazing!;I'm not a huge flavored coffee fan. Usually I prefer lattes with flavored syrups.
8863;My Favorite Tea;I'm so happy this tea is available on amazon now.  I love it but I'm not always able to find it at stores.
8864;Dog's Liked It, But Basically Junkfood;My dogs seemed to like Chef Michael's Grilled Sirloin dog food, but after reading the ingredients, I realize there wasn't much nutrition. Yes, beef is the first ingredient listed, so that's a plus, but it pretty much went downhill from there.
8865;These surprised me!;Let me start off by saying, I don't normally like fig cookies. Just something about them in cookies.
8866;Mild, but great, great aroma.;Have this handy when entertaining guests
8867;It's candy.;This candy tastes like you have a dollop of honey in your mouth. That would be very strange if it were not honey flavored, but since it is, it's perfect.
8868;Unbelievably delicious!!;I bought two jars
8869;Huge hit with cats and dogs.;Freeze Dried Treats were a huge hit in my house!  My dog absolutely loved them, and she's a dog who isn't all that into food.  I especially like that since they are dry you can stuff them in a kong without getting the kong stuck with nasty food you can't clean out.
8870;Yummy over ice cream....;I'm not a coffee drinker, but enjoy a treat now & then of ice cream sweetened by Splenda (no dangerous nutrasweet for me).  Using this tasty sugar-free syrup poured over vanilla ice cream & scattered with some sliced almonds is a much healthier treat & is safe for diabetics or those of us watching our calories & endeavoring to eat wisely.
8871;ritz crackers: hint of salt;I find this is an excellent product, especially when you likie to limit your salt intake. I have ordered these crackers many times and am ordering again today.
8872;Yum!;LorAnn Almond Emulsion is fantastic. It is far better than run of the mill almond extract with a well defined almond flavor and aroma.
8873;Amaranth;It smells delicious but unfortunately my 11 month old was having problems with the Amaranth.  He does eat some finger foods - mango, peaches, carrots, etc.
8874;magnesium powder;very high quality health based item with great prices on Amazon. If magnesium powder has helped you in the past or you just want to give it a try then this is a good buy for you.
8875;Love Gano;Great product. Tastes great, less acid, and helps me feel good knowing I'm making a smart choice for me.
8876;Just downright sinful!;If you like Chips Ahoy products, they don't disappoint with these cookies. They are truly sinful.
8877;Surprisingly Great;I first tried these when the organic co-op I belong to had them displayed for sale during pick-ups. I love the flavor, I've only tried 2 or 3 but this is my favorite.
8878;HORRIBLE doesn't begin to describe this product!  Very disappointed!;"The product description says: ""Keta Salmon Caviar is from the select roe of the Keta Salmon, which has very large eggs with a color that can range from bright red to brilliant orange.""<br /><br />The caviar I received consisted of really small eggs (about half the size of those at a sushi restaurant) that are mushy, and taste awful."
8879;Only the best for my dog;Our dog loves this food. We tried the salmon and the whitefish flavors also but he clearly likes the chicken the best.
8880;I agree it was fast shipment but ...;it was the first ever I've ordered a box of marzipan and the paper stuck to the assorted fruit pieces.  It quite spoiled the treat for me.
8881;Broken cookies.;We buy this type of product because of a health condition. We ordered these cookies fully expecting them to arrive in a some what good condition.
8882;Keep Dry To Prevent Clumping!;For those with clumping problems: I have encountered this too.  It happens when the cereal soaks up too much moisture from the air!  Seal the bag carefully, and if the air where you live is especially moist, you might even consider transferring the cereal to another container that can be sealed airtight.
8883;LOVE THIS STUFF!!;If you love Chai, you will love this tea.  I cannot get it anymore at my local grocery stores.
8884;Delicious and at a great price;These syrups for Sno Cones are delicious. Our family loves them, we had also purchased a pack of the Hawaiian Ice syrups and we prefer these (and they are cheaper).
8885;Hazel nut kcup;I was disappointed to recieve the k-cups in a cardboard box and not in the orginal box.  Coffee does not have its normal fresh taste.
8886;taste okay but the price..? lol;Really dumb to show a photo of the package saying 2 for a dollar and then the title says 2 for 2 dollars is the original price..
8887;Great treats for training;These treats are really small (maybe a quarter-inch square), so I can give them frequently to reinforce behavior.  My dog goes nuts for them, much more so than for any larger treat I've given her.
8888;Not better than a Kong;I got this toys for my pom/corgi mix, thinking it would be a nice alternative to her Kong which doesn't really hold onto treats (she's really good at getting dry treats out in 2 minutes flat).  She was able to pop the treats out very quickly, and unlike one of the other reviewers, they don't really last.
8889;WAY better than I expected;The label says they're popped, rather than fried or baked.  However they did it, these are great chips!  They're very nicely seasoned such that I don't think you'd be inclined to dip them, though they're certainly sturdy enough to.
8890;The Scent of Vanilla;Having already tried the caramel fusion and enjoying it, I decided to give vanilla a try.  I am not normally a fan of vanilla coffee as the smells is often more potent than the taste.
8891;Good Product;Good product. The shipping was a bit slow, but I do enjoy a cup every now and then especially after having transverse myelitis.
8892;Convenient way to shop;Price very competetive.  Save a trip shopping for the best price.
8893;Wonderful treats!!;I have a 12 yr old dalmation
8894;It's like the old joke: these cheese straws are terrible, and the portions are so small!;I was initially disappointed on opening the package because the packages are so tiny.  Then I was more disappointed because they are less than half full.
8895;My 9th favorite flavor.;Diamond Almonds<br />Almonds are a good source of magnesium. One ounce contain approximately 20% of the RDA for an adult recommended dietary allowance (RDA)<br />Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) the amounts of selected nutrients considered adequate to meet the known nutrient needs of healthy people.
8896;So convenient!!;If you've ever made popcorn in a machine you know what a pain it can be to get the right seasoning, the right oil taste and order decent popcorn that pops the way it should.  Once we started ordering the Great Northern Popcorn packets we didn't have to worry about it anymore.
8897;Truly a restful 'time out' for yourself;I can't describe fully the immense calmness this tea brings to you. It is as good as being immersed in a warm bubble bath listening to Kenny G.
8898;Great for barbeque!!;This sauce will give you a great and original taste to your barbeque. My suggestion is to serve the sauce on the side (instead of on top of the meat) to enjoy your barbeque with the possibility of a variety of flavors.
8899;Great Tasting...;Bridgford Pepperoni,Old world, has to be one of the great tasting pepperoni's for anyone who likes pepperoni. I have had three orders of this pepperoni, the last being this past Christmas, wow what a surprising  Christmas gift, and I will be ordering more in the furture.
8900;popcorn flops;we bought the jelly belly flops and most were popcorn flavored which i absolutely abhor..
8901;Flavorless;This was dissapointing. So much so that I wouldnt waste another second on talking about it except to say Im tossing the product because it was lacked any taste whatsoever and I wouldnt want to inflict the nothing on another being.
8902;If you REALLY love me...;dear friends and family..
8903;bigelow tea;its the best tea we have had. i order it all the time.
8904;Snikiddy Southwest Cheddar Cheese Fries;This review is for the Southwest Cheddar cheese fries by Snikiddy.  I've tried the regular Cheddar cheese ones as well, but that's a separate review.
8905;Not Good...;The soup base is disgusting. I ordered this with high hopes on all the rave 5 star reviews.
8906;The Second New Flavor of the Quintessential Condiment!;"This was the second modern variation on an essentially unchanged, bestselling product for more than 140 years.  Other flavors are:<br /><br /><a href=""http://www."
8907;Nature's Honey;First, the transaction and deliver went very smoothly and the package was well-packed.  I just tasted it and it tastes delicious.
8908;Run of the Mill;The problem is that when you tried the best, if only for one time, you start comparing all the rest to that high standard. I had better boullion and this one is average.
8909;Tasty Mango Fruit Squeeze;We buy these for our kids who are a little bit older but need something to snack on in between school and long swim practices.  The kids love them and they are healthy.
8910;pb2 - yum;Pb2 is really good, true peanut taste without the fat and calories.  My husband who is pb obsessive, even had to admit it was very good.
8911;WAKE UP TO VANILLA COFFEE;I have to say that although I'm not a big fan of Starbucks coffee since I find it too strong and sometimes having a burnt taste, I was pleasantly surprised with this vanilla flavored coffee, even though I don't normally care for a vanilla flavor in my coffee. I found both the vanilla scent and the flavor pretty natural and I would recommend it if you like flavored coffees, especially flavored with vanilla.
8912;Made my caramels look professional;I make homemade caramels hand dipped in dark chocolate for holiday gifts. Along with a sprinkle of sea salt, I added these silver stars.
8913;Have not received order;I am still waiting for my order. It has been over a month and still nothing has come.
8914;Crunchy yet satisfying;I average eating a bag every two days.  I enjoy the baked taste and crunchy texture.
8915;Easy Candy Preparation;This product is awesome.  The chocolate comes in it's own microwavable container.
8916;Bad batch;My order arrived with a cracked lid.  Fortunately the inner seal was still intact.
8917;Delightful!;First of all, the smell when you open each bag is very pleasing. I like the fact that each tea bag is individually foil wrapped for freshness.
8918;great..;this product is great..
8919;Yum yum, good!;Reviews must be at least 20 words long, so here goes: Finally jelly beans that are polar opposites of the usual sickeningly sweet variety with undecipherable flavors. These guys really taste good (and the dog loves them too).
8920;Lemongrass Good Earth Tea;My husband drinks this every morning for breakfast. It tastes good and smells wonderful.
8921;Big Bear;I love the flavor and health benefits of the tea.  The product seems to be affordable for the average consumer.
8922;Quality Spices;I use a lot of various spices in my cooking and wanted to find a source with a quality product at a reasonable price.  Frontier met that discription.
8923;best natural endurance hydration for on the go;I hate sugary sports drinks and avoid cumbersome packet type additives. A few Zico's makes a great companions on long rides.
8924;Delicious and healthier alternative to other fried chips.;Since these are fried in oil, they are by no means a health food, especially if you are focused on calories.  That said though, they are an excellent snack and a much healthier alternative to potato chips or corn chips.
8925;DELICOUS TREAT FOR DOGS;This is a Delicious treat for your dogs.  I am unhappy with<br />Amazon because we paid for the product, but never received it.
8926;Not worth the money;OMG..
8927;It works!;I have to admit up front that it has only been a week since my two cats have started eating this food exclusively.  I don't want to jinx it, but this food is amazing.
8928;Yummylicious!;These are the quick and easiest scones to make!  I have been making the Krusteaz brand scones for over 10 years and they are always a favorite with my friends and family.  Usually, I add currents to the mix, but I have also added dried cherries, almond extract, and cinnamon chips (not at the same time!).
8929;Terrible! The cups were empty!;I was so disappointed!  I received the cups and tried one right away.  It was like hot water.
8930;I am hooked on this coffee;There may be a need to start a 12-step program for this coffee.  :)<br /><br />I do not usually like flavored coffees but I am so glad that I tried this one.
8931;This is so convenient;About a year ago, I realized that my local grocery store chains often do not have my favorite teas on the shelf and the prices (up to $4.00 a box) are outrageous.
8932;what's going on?;You advertise a significant price reduction but do not deliver. The orphans will be hungry because of you.
8933;Great for training;These are fantastic training treats. Great to take on walks, perfect size.
8934;Very Good Iced tea too;I did not like any of the brew over iced tea flavors so i tried this and love it.  Would definately recommend for iced or hot tea.
8935;A great reward for kids!!!;My five-year-old grand-son works hard to earn these bars as his reward(s) by putting toys and tools away after using them, and for proving his memorization exercises (Squares vs rectangles, circles vs ovals, phone numbers, addresses, etc. We grand-parents love them, too.
8936;Looks like vomit in a bowl, and my dogs HATE it!;I've got two dogs who will eat almost anything. I like to give them good, wholesome food and the increasing prices make it difficult.
8937;yummy;I love banana nut bread. Now I can have it in a delicious bar that I can travel around with.
8938;Wonderful all around olive oil;I love olive oil and use it almost every day.  I'm from a Greek family so I was raised with lots of olive oil.
8939;Cello!!!;I love these bags for packaging. I plan to buy more since they are a perfect size for 2-3 soaps or any other kind of gift.
8940;GENUINE IRISH TEA;I was introduced to Barry's Teas while in Ireland and brought back two boxes!  When that was gone, I found it at Amazon.com and ordered two more boxes.
8941;My cat goes bananas for Temptations;I have a very tall, lean, long-legged male cat. He doesn't eat much.
8942;rather bland;Personally I find this blend to be rather bland.  However, my wife really likes it, so I'll rate it 4 stars.
8943;Pure Ambrosia!;I've been a fan of Blue Diamond's almond milk for a while now, and have tried their coconut milk, but when I first tasted this stuff, I was blown away. It has a flavor that is *much* better than either almond or coconut milk individually, and has a light, smooth, even texture that feels like you're drinking liquid silk.
8944;Good for so many things!;I have been on a diet plan, and use this syrup to give my vanilla shakes some variety. It works really well.
8945;Everlasting? Not even for 1 hour!;"This is one of the quite typical case of misleading descriptions and claims. This so called ""everlasting"" and ""large"" treat did not last for even an hour after I gave it to my dog."
8946;Honey Dijon leaves bad aftertaste, NY Cheddar are pretty good;Honey Dijon flavor: okay flavor, but both my girlfriend and I thought they left a bad aftertaste. The aftertaste is sort of like old cheese (presumably some folks like this.
8947;Gumballs;The double bubble gumball refill 53 oz jar was all in all great.  There were a couple things the dubble bubble folks could improve on.
8948;Rich, Flavorful, and Affordable;We love this maple syrup. We found it to be rich and flavorful.
8949;Tastes like Frosted Flakes with a honey nut flavor;"This cereal tastes very good - similar to Frosted Flakes with a distinct honey and nut ""flavor"" although I didn't really taste the peanuts because the peanut flakes on the cereal are so small.<br /><br />I consider Crunchy Nut more like a dessert cereal than a good-for-you-type cereal because of all the sugar and high fructose corn syrup in the ingredients even though it's fortified with lots of Vitamins (A, C, Iron, D, etc."
8950;Finally, no more diarrhea!;Got this for a kitten who has had diarrhea for 7 months. We had tried four other foods--Two science diet from vet, two that were free of soy, corn or wheat
8951;Dang good rendang;Having once been a twenty one year old student on a budget living in Tokyo Japan, I've eaten my share (and more )of wholesome, filling curry. From the two hundred yen plates under the railroad tracks, to twenty-two hundred yen plates at posh Tops Saxon, I know good curry (and bad curry) when I taste it.
8952;Great Popcorn!!!!!!;I discovered this popcorn a while back & just fell in love with it. I have a hard time finding it in the snack size.
8953;Best stuff on earth;My wife and I use this every night before we go to bed.  It is just as natural to us as breathing.
8954;Great Coffee;Nice Aroma, very tasty and the crema..
8955;my dogs really liked this;I have two min. schnauzers and they tend to be picky eaters.
8956;Fan-friggen-tastic;These are very good.<br />Like salt-and-vinegar potato chips, but more substantial and delicious.
8957;Goodbye Rawhides! Hello Peace of Mind - & Dogs Love 'em!;Love these! Well, because..
8958;Pink Salt is Perfect;I had this salt at a friends today. It a perfect salt as it had no fillers and comes in the form of flakes.
8959;Just ok;I tried the variety pack and there wasn't one flavor that I really thought was outstanding.  While I love Pop Chips, these were just ok, and to be truthful if I'm going to order anything again, it'd be Pop Chips and not the Tortilla Chips.
8960;My 1st Krispy Kreme experience was ruined...;While Krispy Kreme is a popular Donut franchise,I had never had a donut from there before,didn't know what it tasted like to see what the big deal was. Yep.
8961;Fellow ship;I am the setup person in my church, for morning coffee and other things between Church service and sunday school. I used to use powder creamers and liquid creamers.
8962;Nice product;The wine saver came on time and as described apart from there was no stand. It does the job as promised and the click when the pressure is right is really helpful.
8963;Watered Down & Way Too Light;This is hardly an Italian brew. I was just drinking a cup and notice it tasted light, watery, and tasteless.
8964;i've had better;dubble bubble has to be the worst buble gum ever invented. the moment you pop it in you mouth you can already taste the awful after-taste.
8965;Lemon-flavored liquid stevia;What a refreshing treat to add to your bottled water during the summer. Since it's difficult for my hubby to drink much plain water, this product really helps with his water consumption.
8966;Never again;I read the reviews and took my chances and bought a bunch.  I am so disappointed by the sweet, lacquered Chinese bbq pork like beef jerky with an overwhelmingly raw garlic/chili favor.
8967;good coffee;we used to roast our own cofee beans, but i wanted a way to have coffee without all of the work.  i tried maxwell house coffee based on soem other reviews and so far I have enjoyed every variety that i've tried.
8968;My favorite of the WP K cups.;Nice round flavor. Not harsh or botter.
8969;Almost perfect!;This is a great tuna, and if you're buying it here in bulk, you've probably already had it.  (NEVER buy something in bulk if you haven't tried it first!)<br /><br />I love the actual tuna, the reason I knocked off a star however is the can.
8970;Not bad using CoffeeMate Chocolate Creamer;Not bad at all when I use CoffeeMate CHOCOLATE creamer.<br />I still like swiss mix made with 2% milk a little better.
8971;it will give you the get up and go!;I think it's a good coffee.I like it better than store bought coffee and the price is decent and the nice thing is they deliver it to your door.
8972;Pumpkin. Just Pumpkin.;Purchased this due to health benefits, be warned the flavor is bland and watery, like unripen raw pumpkin.<br />Purchased case in March 2010- Cans were slightly dented.
8973;Tastes wonderful - but....;These taste wonderful - on the flavor I have no complaints at all..
8974;Puppy Loves It But Eats It Too Fast;"My 45 lb lab mix loves these 24"" rawhide bones but they only last 48 hours at best. She's like a wood chipper when she gets going."
8975;slim jim;The box of slim jims was received in good condition,and there where no bad surprizes. The taste of the slim jims was just what I remember from when I was a small kid over 50 years ago, although the size of the product has gotten smaller, it still tastes the same.
8976;Five stars, with caveat;My dog loves these!  He likes all the flavors, but carrot is his favorite.  He is allergic to corn and wheat, so he can't have greenies (fine by me, zukes is a better company anyway) or many other dental treats.
8977;Great product;All the david rio chai's are good.  This one has great flavor for being decaf and sugar-free.
8978;Very Bold cup of decaf!;If you enjoy a bold cup of coffee during the day you will love this decaf version the best.  I have looked everywhere for a good strong cup of decaf and hadnt found one until now.
8979;Perfection!  Sweet and SPICY!;I've been having terrible cravings for Ginger and you wouldn't believe how difficult it is to find decent 'Crystalized Ginger' 'round these parts.  The candied ginger I've found at the local grocery store could have been plain ol' sugar cubes for all it's worth.
8980;Fresh ginger & mellow lemon;This herbal tea is well balanced and pleasant.  It tastes to me like good real lemon, but not acidic.
8981;My kids love it...they think of it as candy;These are great tasting snacks. I always have some in my diaper bag and my kids think of these as candy.
8982;"I've finally found ""my"" bar";I've been some combination of nursing and/or pregnant for a few years now, and trying to find time for a meal when chasing after a toddler or when morning sickness gives you many reasons to avoid every food on earth can be a real challenge. Because of this I sometimes feel like my pantry is some sort of test cabinet for a nutritional bar company.
8983;Terrible;I've been eating Quaker Instant Oatmeal for years. I like most of the flavors ( even the plain ) and the banana cream is wonderful but they only sell it in the variety pack.
8984;Best Water On The Market!;This water (coming from a person who has spent $10+ on fine water and has also bottled water at the source)is honestly the best water around. Smooth, crisp, and with a great taste.
8985;If Movie Theatre Butter is What You're Looking For, This is all You Need.;This Butter Flavored Popcorn Topping is perfect if you're looking to make popcorn that tastes like what you get at the movie theatre.  It is a very large bottle, however, so you better like popcorn a lot if you're thinking about purchasing this product.
8986;OK taste, crappy ingredients;Good taste and texture (a bit high on sodium: 460 mg
8987;Licorice AND Chocolate...YUM!;If you like Black Licorice (and is there really any other kind) and chocolate, you will LOVE these.  It's a bit of Heaven!  I've been losing weight this past year, 118 pounds worth, but for Christmas, I will treat myself to one of these.
8988;High Quality Cardamon gave to friends for cooking INDIA style;My friends are from India and this was a gift I enjoy watching them cook and use spices like this I have no cooking knowledge of.  Theyaid this is very fresh Cardamon so I have to take their word.
8989;Diff'rent Strokes;"I often come across a product that repels me.  Then, occasionally, my taste buds change direction to the point of craving the aforementioned ""repulsion."
8990;BEST sardines!;These are my favorite sardines! They're larger, whiter pieces of fish & don't look like a can full of minnows.  26 grams of protein - a very good snack!  Buying them by the case at Amazon, including shipping is still cheaper per container than buying them at Whole Foods, which is the only grocery where I've found them.
8991;Perfect gift for grandmother's birthday;I purchased this for my grandmother's birthday. She wrote back and stated that this was such a nice gift.
8992;variable quality;we ordered one of these and our dog loved it - the peanut butter in the center was hard for her to get at and kept her occupied for weeks.<br /><br />she liked them so much we ordered a bunch more.
8993;Pretty darn good;I love pumpkin spice coffee. I'm an addict of Starbucks' Pumpkin Spice Latte so finding a good pumpkin spice K-cup was a mission for me.
8994;VERY OK Price, OK Coffee;"This is a nice ""middle."" It's a good-tasting roast coffee, with some hazelnut flavor."
8995;outstanding;Hands down the best olives you can get from a can. They have a hint of bitterness that makes them very addictive.
8996;Wolfgand Puck Rodeo Drive K-cup;This coffee says medium roast but is actually a little stronger.  We loved it and it has become our favorite.
8997;Surprisingly good;I wasn't expecting much when I got these on a lightning deal. They are suppose to be healthy so I was expecting some cut backs on the flavor.
8998;Buyer Beware!This product contains High Fructose Corn Syrup!;It's no secret that high fructose corn syrup is detrimental to your health. Unfortunately, it's also no secret that it has replaced other forms of sugar in a disturbingly large number of manufactured foods.
8999;ambrosia;My first review( don't think previous went through) however just recieved my first order from s.f.
9000;Tassimo Gevalia Morning Roast T-Discs;I like this product a lot.  It's full-bodied for those like me who drink their coffee black, and it's strong enough for those who like to add cream and sugar.
